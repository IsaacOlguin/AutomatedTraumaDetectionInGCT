JUDGE ROBINSON:  My monitor isn't working, but we can proceed.
Mr. Kay, do you remember at the last session Mr. Milosevic was
seeking to lead through this witness evidence which he said would
discredit Prosecution witnesses Dulovic and Anastasijevic insofar as it
would show discrepancies between the evidence that they had given in a
special court in Belgrade.
THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can barely hear this.
The volume
is down.
I can barely hear the interpretation.
JUDGE ROBINSON: Yes, it's better now.
Yes.
THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] It's not better.
It's not better.
[In English] You can try it.
JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is it any better, Mr. --
THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, now it is better.
JUDGE ROBINSON: Okay.
Yes, we'll proceed.
I was recalling for Mr. Kay's benefit, and Mr. Milosevic's, the
evidence which Mr.
Milosevic sought to lead through this witness of what
he said were discrepancies between Prosecution witnesses Dulovic and
Anastasijevic's evidence given in this court and evidence which they gave
in a special court in Belgrade.
I had indicated to him that there are
other ways of introducing that evidence which he felt was important to his
case, and I'm going to ask the assigned counsel to investigate this
matter, to get hold of the transcript, and I would leave it to their
discretion to -- whether to seek to lead that evidence through whatever
means is appropriate.
MR.
KAY: Thank you, Your Honour.
THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone please for Mr. Kay.
MR.
KAY: It seemed to us on Friday whether we discussed this
issue, Ms. Higgins and myself, that the obvious way forward was to have
the original transcripts of the hearing set against the evidence that was
given here so that the issues of the discrepancies can be seen from the
primary material.
JUDGE ROBINSON: Yes. Yes.
I would not want this evidence to be
lost to the accused, and that is why I'm asking assigned counsel to
investigate the matter.
MR.
KAY: We will.
JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thanks.
Yes, Mr. Milosevic.
WITNESS:  VOJISLAV SESELJ [Resumed]
[Witness answered through interpreter]
Examined by Mr. Milosevic:  [Continued]
Q.   [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some
questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian
indictment, that have to do with the "Rump Presidency" as it's called
here.
You have partly answered that.
It says: "The Rump Presidency
carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies," and so on and so forth, "had
