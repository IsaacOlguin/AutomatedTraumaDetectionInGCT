<P> 2                          [Open session]</P>
<P> 3                          [The accused entered court]</P>
<P> 4                          [The witness entered court]</P>
<P> 5                          --- Upon commencing at 2.20 p.m.</P>
<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  My monitor isn't working, but we can proceed.</P>
<P> 7            Mr. Kay, do you remember at the last session Mr. Milosevic was</P>
<P> 8    seeking to lead through this witness evidence which he said would</P>
<P> 9    discredit Prosecution witnesses Dulovic and Anastasijevic insofar as it</P>
<P>10    would show discrepancies between the evidence that they had given in a</P>
<P>11    special court in Belgrade.</P>
<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can barely hear this.  The volume</P>
<P>13    is down.  I can barely hear the interpretation.</P>
<P>14            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, it's better now.  Yes.</P>
<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] It's not better.  It's not better.</P>
<P>16    [In English] You can try it.</P>
<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is it any better, Mr. --</P>
<P>18            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, now it is better.</P>
<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Yes, we'll proceed.</P>
<P>20            I was recalling for Mr. Kay's benefit, and Mr. Milosevic's, the</P>
<P>21    evidence which Mr. Milosevic sought to lead through this witness of what</P>
<P>22    he said were discrepancies between Prosecution witnesses Dulovic and</P>
<P>23    Anastasijevic's evidence given in this court and evidence which they gave</P>
<P>24    in a special court in Belgrade.  I had indicated to him that there are</P>
<P>25    other ways of introducing that evidence which he felt was important to his</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43648 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    case, and I'm going to ask the assigned counsel to investigate this</P>
<P> 2    matter, to get hold of the transcript, and I would leave it to their</P>
<P> 3    discretion to -- whether to seek to lead that evidence through whatever</P>
<P> 4    means is appropriate.</P>
<P> 5            MR. KAY:  Thank you, Your Honour.</P>
<P> 6            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone please for Mr. Kay.</P>
<P> 7            MR. KAY:  It seemed to us on Friday whether we discussed this</P>
<P> 8    issue, Ms. Higgins and myself, that the obvious way forward was to have</P>
<P> 9    the original transcripts of the hearing set against the evidence that was</P>
<P>10    given here so that the issues of the discrepancies can be seen from the</P>
<P>11    primary material.</P>
<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Yes.  I would not want this evidence to be</P>
<P>13    lost to the accused, and that is why I'm asking assigned counsel to</P>
<P>14    investigate the matter.</P>
<P>15            MR. KAY:  We will.</P>
<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thanks.</P>
<P>17            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>18                          WITNESS:  VOJISLAV SESELJ [Resumed]</P>
<P>19                          [Witness answered through interpreter]</P>
<P>20                          Examined by Mr. Milosevic:  [Continued]</P>
<P>21       Q.   [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some</P>
<P>22    questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian</P>
<P>23    indictment, that have to do with the "Rump Presidency" as it's called</P>
<P>24    here.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  "The Rump Presidency</P>
<P>25    carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies," and so on and so forth, "had</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43649 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    effect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief."</P>
<P> 2            I'm not going to ask you to repeat what you've already said, but</P>
<P> 3    in relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of</P>
<P> 4    Serbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they</P>
<P> 5    not take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency</P>
<P> 6    of the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any</P>
<P> 7    objective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from</P>
<P> 8    carrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?</P>
<P> 9            The question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,</P>
<P>10    Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the</P>
<P>11    SFRY Presidency in Belgrade?</P>
<P>12       A.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,</P>
<P>13    staying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was</P>
<P>14    never a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from</P>
<P>15    carrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped</P>
<P>16    coming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had</P>
<P>17    practically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe</P>
<P>18    Mesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying</P>
<P>19    that they could not come because they could not strike a balance in</P>
<P>20    relation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and</P>
<P>21    Montenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.</P>
<P>22            The representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were</P>
<P>23    not expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was</P>
<P>24    actually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display</P>
<P>25    such feelings at the time.  It's only when he left Belgrade and when he</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43650 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    came back to the Croatian parliament that he said, "I've completed my</P>
<P> 2    duty.  Yugoslavia is no more."</P>
<P> 3            He pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.</P>
<P> 4    Also, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him</P>
<P> 5    sufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he</P>
<P> 6    condemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most</P>
<P> 7    cooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was</P>
<P> 8    what he was.</P>
<P> 9            I already said that according to the constitution of the then</P>
<P>10    Yugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one</P>
<P>11    single member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been</P>
<P>12    prevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could</P>
<P>13    have gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could</P>
<P>14    have refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the</P>
<P>15    Presidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the</P>
<P>16    Presidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed</P>
<P>17    within the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably</P>
<P>18    before Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a</P>
<P>19    Rump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of</P>
<P>20    a rump Presidency.</P>
<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.</P>
<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>23       Q.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  "Slobodan Milosevic,</P>
<P>24    in his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that</P>
<P>25    Yugoslavia was finished."</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43651 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1            Please, you've got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I'm not</P>
<P> 2    going to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much</P>
<P> 3    time.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to</P>
<P> 4    here or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that</P>
<P> 5    Yugoslavia was finished?</P>
<P> 6       A.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say</P>
<P> 7    that Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you</P>
<P> 8    never said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I</P>
<P> 9    remember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the</P>
<P>10    behaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went</P>
<P>11    through a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,</P>
<P>12    constitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,</P>
<P>13    but then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional</P>
<P>14    provision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases</P>
<P>15    to exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the</P>
<P>16    matter.</P>
<P>17            The leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never</P>
<P>18    did it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and</P>
<P>19    Croatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and</P>
<P>20    Macedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro</P>
<P>21    proclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting</P>
<P>22    of two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration</P>
<P>23    on your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.</P>
<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>
<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>

<P> 1       Q.   "In March 1991 the collective Presidency of the SFRY reached a</P>
<P> 2    deadlock on several issues."  That is paragraph 56.</P>
<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... that sentence</P>
<P> 4    which is at the beginning of the paragraph.  There's another allegation in</P>
<P> 5    that last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no</P>
<P> 6    longer be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask</P>
<P> 7    Mr. Seselj whether that is so.</P>
<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember</P>
<P> 9    at that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian</P>
<P>10    public, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the</P>
<P>11    decisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that</P>
<P>12    Serbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation</P>
<P>13    when the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.</P>
<P>14            I would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there</P>
<P>15    was a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the</P>
<P>16    headquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long</P>
<P>17    debate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the</P>
<P>18    demand of the military to declare a state of emergency.</P>
<P>19            The top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the</P>
<P>20    behaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a</P>
<P>21    vote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.  As far as I can</P>
<P>22    remember --</P>
<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You have answered the question I asked, thanks.</P>
<P>24            Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>

<P> 1       Q.   That is what is referred to here.  It says the representatives on</P>
<P> 2    the Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,</P>
<P> 3    the autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of</P>
<P> 4    Kosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what</P>
<P> 5    was so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the</P>
<P> 6    Presidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?</P>
<P> 7       A.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also</P>
<P> 8    start the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven't got the document here</P>
<P> 9    so I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were</P>
<P>10    actually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already</P>
<P>11    started putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the</P>
<P>12    Presidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the</P>
<P>13    Presidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not</P>
<P>14    very constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the</P>
<P>15    Presidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,</P>
<P>16    or Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.</P>
<P>17    I think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been</P>
<P>18    recalled in the meantime.</P>
<P>19       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that</P>
<P>20    session or before that session or in relation to that session I never</P>
<P>21    declared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did</P>
<P>22    they declare that Yugoslavia was finished?</P>
<P>23       A.   I've already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian</P>
<P>24    politicians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was</P>
<P>25    one of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43654 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    hard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.</P>
<P> 2            As for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in</P>
<P> 3    Montenegro either.</P>
<P> 4       Q.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to</P>
<P> 5    normal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic</P>
<P> 6    was elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented</P>
<P> 7    Vojvodina at the time.</P>
<P> 8       A.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the</P>
<P> 9    Presidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started</P>
<P>10    working again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its</P>
<P>11    work.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of</P>
<P>12    Bosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil</P>
<P>13    Tupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new</P>
<P>14    crisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be</P>
<P>15    elected president of the Presidency.</P>
<P>16            There was a principle involved that the president of the</P>
<P>17    Presidency was elected from a different republican province every year but</P>
<P>18    nobody's election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic</P>
<P>19    did not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European</P>
<P>20    envoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to</P>
<P>21    elect him nevertheless.</P>
<P>22       Q.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?</P>
<P>23       A.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting</P>
<P>24    the preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from</P>
<P>25    those positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43655 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1       Q.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says</P>
<P> 2    that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and</P>
<P> 3    discussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between</P>
<P> 4    Serbia and Croatia?</P>
<P> 5       A.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I</P>
<P> 6    remember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what</P>
<P> 7    was skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching</P>
<P> 8    agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the</P>
<P> 9    Bosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a</P>
<P>10    situation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it</P>
<P>11    increasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the</P>
<P>12    country at the time.</P>
<P>13            At that time, I -- as I've already said, the presidents of the</P>
<P>14    presidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys</P>
<P>15    had actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach</P>
<P>16    agreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia</P>
<P>17    increasingly so.</P>
<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through</P>
<P>19    what medium?</P>
<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully</P>
<P>21    being bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media</P>
<P>22    this kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were</P>
<P>23    already at that time being financed from the West by different Western</P>
<P>24    intelligence agencies, so that's the kind of media I'm talking about.  In</P>
<P>25    Belgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43656 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    federal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic</P>
<P> 2    government, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government</P>
<P> 3    in Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the</P>
<P> 4    Western powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante</P>
<P> 5    Markovic's government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible</P>
<P> 6    agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia</P>
<P> 7    together under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been</P>
<P> 8    eliminated.</P>
<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>11       Q.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at</P>
<P>12    one stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence</P>
<P>13    counsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest</P>
<P>14    collaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This</P>
<P>15    denies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of</P>
<P>16    Bosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted</P>
<P>17    into evidence and if not we will find this transcript.</P>
<P>18            However, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with</P>
<P>19    you as you were an active participant in all political events.  This</P>
<P>20    meeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the</P>
<P>21    division of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any</P>
<P>22    member of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning</P>
<P>23    of which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way</P>
<P>24    even indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?</P>
<P>25       A.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43657 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    if Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia</P>
<P> 2    as an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as</P>
<P> 3    a constituent nation as they had been before in the previous</P>
<P> 4    constitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the</P>
<P> 5    first president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it</P>
<P> 6    was not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint</P>
<P> 7    state.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans</P>
<P> 8    persuaded him to call off the agreement.</P>
<P> 9       Q.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It</P>
<P>10    says:  "On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY</P>
<P>11    Presidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,</P>
<P>12    Sejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY</P>
<P>13    Presidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the</P>
<P>14    Presidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and</P>
<P>15    Macedonia."</P>
<P>16            On the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.  Was this</P>
<P>17    a kind of takeover of the function of the Presidency or were these</P>
<P>18    functions being carried out by the legal representatives?</P>
<P>19       A.   There was absolutely no takeover.  When four of the members of the</P>
<P>20    Presidency withdrew and some of them officially gave notice that they were</P>
<P>21    no longer members, like Drnovsek, for instance, while others simply</P>
<P>22    stopped attending the sessions.  The Presidency continued working with the</P>
<P>23    members who -- whom it was possible to gather together.</P>
<P>24            I suggest that the Chamber get hold of this piece of legislation.</P>
<P>25    I cannot quote it verbatim right now, but I'm absolutely sure it existed.</P>

<P> 1    And according to this piece of legislation, even if the majority of</P>
<P> 2    members could not meet, the Presidency under certain circumstances would</P>
<P> 3    continue working with the members who were present.</P>
<P> 4            Let me remind you that in the spring of 1991 or in the early</P>
<P> 5    summer, there was a vote taken to declare a imminent threat of war.</P>
<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 65 it says:  "On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,</P>
<P> 7    Slobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal</P>
<P> 8    enterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from</P>
<P> 9    Belgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the</P>
<P>10    mobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay</P>
<P>11    in Yugoslavia."</P>
<P>12            First of all, let's establish when I began advocating a unitary</P>
<P>13    Serb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And</P>
<P>14    secondly, was this anyone's idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,</P>
<P>15    and is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever</P>
<P>16    been a unitary state?</P>
<P>17       A.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as</P>
<P>18    Yugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally</P>
<P>19    and your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt</P>
<P>20    the new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the</P>
<P>21    autonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the</P>
<P>22    Serb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of</P>
<P>23    autonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an</P>
<P>24    option.</P>
<P>25            Furthermore, when the four former federal units had already been</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43660 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    recognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the</P>
<P> 2    Montenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be</P>
<P> 3    promulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump</P>
<P> 4    Yugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would</P>
<P> 5    have been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -</P>
<P> 6    because that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary</P>
<P> 7    Serbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this</P>
<P> 8    but didn't want to, and I am sorry that you didn't do that, because up to</P>
<P> 9    the point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --</P>
<P>10    in Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It</P>
<P>11    appeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.</P>
<P>12       Q.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any</P>
<P>13    of my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who</P>
<P>14    were allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had</P>
<P>15    any kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?</P>
<P>16       A.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated</P>
<P>17    with you advocated such an idea.</P>
<P>18       Q.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it</P>
<P>19    says here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of</P>
<P>20    reservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the</P>
<P>21    reasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was</P>
<P>22    called for?</P>
<P>23       A.   I'm not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation</P>
<P>24    of reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to</P>
<P>25    mobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43661 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    to take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the</P>
<P> 2    territorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that</P>
<P> 3    this mobilisation didn't go well.  The response was very poor, because</P>
<P> 4    Veljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn't want to remove the</P>
<P> 5    communist insignia from the military uniforms.</P>
<P> 6            The Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the</P>
<P> 7    Presidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was</P>
<P> 8    Prime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in</P>
<P> 9    Slovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of</P>
<P>10    such an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops</P>
<P>11    into Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then</P>
<P>12    leadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as</P>
<P>13    I know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership</P>
<P>14    which had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.</P>
<P>15       Q.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your</P>
<P>16    name, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask</P>
<P>17    you now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of</P>
<P>18    April, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan's and</P>
<P>19    Seselj's men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you</P>
<P>20    know anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and</P>
<P>21    cart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of</P>
<P>22    cooperation with Arkan's volunteer guard?</P>
<P>23       A.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>
<P>24    did not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert</P>
<P>25    that, I'm saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43662 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    organised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as</P>
<P> 2    much as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.</P>
<P> 3    That's a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb</P>
<P> 4    Radical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty</P>
<P> 5    to Serbia.  I guarantee that.</P>
<P> 6            The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict</P>
<P> 7    instructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb</P>
<P> 8    volunteer guard up to the --</P>
<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm asking why was that instruction given to the</P>
<P>10    volunteers of the Serb Radical Party?</P>
<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.</P>
<P>12    We didn't want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn't</P>
<P>13    want people's awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.</P>
<P>14            As I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,</P>
<P>15    long before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had</P>
<P>16    quarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was</P>
<P>17    in danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this</P>
<P>18    in the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.</P>
<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding</P>
<P>20    that instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with</P>
<P>21    Arkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You're</P>
<P>22    not there with them.</P>
<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can't say that not a single</P>
<P>24    volunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There's one</P>
<P>25    instance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43663 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    teacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>
<P> 2    Party.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of</P>
<P> 3    about 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back</P>
<P> 4    but, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of</P>
<P> 5    Arkan's men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.</P>
<P> 6            So, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint</P>
<P> 7    military activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with</P>
<P> 8    Arkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a</P>
<P> 9    distance from Arkan.</P>
<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.</P>
<P>11            Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>13       Q.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on</P>
<P>14    transcript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia</P>
<P>15    took place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj's</P>
<P>16    White Eagles.</P>
<P>17            First of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and</P>
<P>18    secondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj's White Eagles?</P>
<P>19       A.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb</P>
<P>20    people organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have</P>
<P>21    already said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of</P>
<P>22    volunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After</P>
<P>23    that, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we</P>
<P>24    had volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never</P>
<P>25    had anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43664 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1            There was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo</P>
<P> 2    Selo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he</P>
<P> 3    was killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not</P>
<P> 4    carrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no</P>
<P> 5    joint military activities.</P>
<P> 6       Q.   Let's clarify this.  It doesn't say here that you cooperated.  It</P>
<P> 7    says here:  "With infiltration of Seselj's White Eagles."  So the White</P>
<P> 8    Eagles are being ascribed to you.</P>
<P> 9       A.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the</P>
<P>10    Prosecutor bringing witnesses here who don't no anything about what</P>
<P>11    happened on the ground.  It's simply nonsense to talk of a group called</P>
<P>12    Seselj's White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and</P>
<P>13    the Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn't know</P>
<P>14    what he was talking about.</P>
<P>15       Q.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,</P>
<P>16    2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that "Seselj collected men in</P>
<P>17    Erdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia."  Is that</P>
<P>18    true, Mr. Seselj?</P>
<P>19            JUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493</P>
<P>20    who testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake</P>
<P>22    in my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that</P>
<P>23    particular page, and the page is 19003.</P>
<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>25       Q.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43665 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    them to Bosnia?</P>
<P> 2       A.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in</P>
<P> 3    Erdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,</P>
<P> 4    nicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only</P>
<P> 5    time.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --</P>
<P> 6    we never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there</P>
<P> 7    either, and I can state that quite categorically.</P>
<P> 8            The people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the</P>
<P> 9    war and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were</P>
<P>10    exclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I</P>
<P>11    absolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan's centre in Erdut</P>
<P>12    later on.  We never had anything to do with it.</P>
<P>13       Q.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is</P>
<P>14    20294, says that Arkan's and Seselj's men shot above the heads of the</P>
<P>15    civilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in</P>
<P>16    Bratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who</P>
<P>17    mistreated and abused the civilians?</P>
<P>18       A.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian</P>
<P>19    Radical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my</P>
<P>20    knowledge Arkan didn't appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in</P>
<P>21    Zvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in</P>
<P>22    Bratunac either.  And I've already said that in Bratunac there was</P>
<P>23    Deronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there</P>
<P>24    I was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have</P>
<P>25    very certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43666 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1       Q.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj's men were</P>
<P> 2    in Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj's</P>
<P> 3    mean there is no difference, says he.</P>
<P> 4       A.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can't see any</P>
<P> 5    difference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the</P>
<P> 6    White Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at</P>
<P> 7    all.  And that's not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some</P>
<P> 8    judgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to</P>
<P> 9    see in some other places Seselj's White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the</P>
<P>10    problem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses</P>
<P>11    which it manipulates.</P>
<P>12       Q.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on</P>
<P>13    several occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --</P>
<P>14            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven't been able to check this myself</P>
<P>15    because the accused hasn't been getting the references correct, and it's</P>
<P>16    quite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I'm grateful to</P>
<P>17    Ms. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came</P>
<P>18    (redacted).</P>
<P>19    But, really, I'm afraid we've got to have correct references for the</P>
<P>20    witnesses.  We can't simply just go to the page in the transcript.</P>
<P>21    Frequently our page numbers don't necessarily coincide here in court, and</P>
<P>22    without reference to the witnesses it's very difficult to pick it up</P>
<P>23    later.</P>
<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in</P>
<P>25    pinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you're referring.  Now,</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43667 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Judge Kwon has already corrected you once, and apparently there is another</P>
<P> 2    mistake in the reference.</P>
<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, perhaps there might be a</P>
<P> 4    mistake with the name, but there is no mistake with the quotation from the</P>
<P> 5    transcript, and my question relates to the material facts which are being</P>
<P> 6    mentioned here.</P>
<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, we have to follow it, Mr. Milosevic.  There</P>
<P> 8    is duty on you to be more careful.</P>
<P> 9            Please proceed.</P>
<P>10            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. Robinson.  And I'll</P>
<P>11    check this out to see whether indeed it is the same witness from</P>
<P>12    page 20352, the transcript line and page, the quotation that I mentioned</P>
<P>13    earlier on or, rather, 20351 is the exact number.  I'll check that out</P>
<P>14    during the break.</P>
<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>16       Q.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript</P>
<P>17    said that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of</P>
<P>18    March, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan's men took part as well as</P>
<P>19    Seselj's men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the</P>
<P>20    occupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on</P>
<P>21    the 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of</P>
<P>22    your volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?</P>
<P>23       A.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What</P>
<P>24    happened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between</P>
<P>25    the JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43668 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Muslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.</P>
<P> 2    However, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went</P>
<P> 3    on for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting</P>
<P> 4    the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was</P>
<P> 5    there, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my</P>
<P> 6    knowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of</P>
<P> 7    the local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to</P>
<P> 8    establish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the</P>
<P> 9    ground there.</P>
<P>10            I know -- have reliable information that the commands and the</P>
<P>11    officers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan's and</P>
<P>12    the Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a</P>
<P>13    great deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very</P>
<P>14    rarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.</P>
<P>15            As far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,</P>
<P>16    over there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did</P>
<P>17    appear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the</P>
<P>18    call of Biljana Plavsic.  I can't prove that, but I do know that Biljana</P>
<P>19    Plavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly</P>
<P>20    meeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The</P>
<P>21    volunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina</P>
<P>22    were not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the</P>
<P>23    Serbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were</P>
<P>24    residents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the</P>
<P>25    conflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43669 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    and Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan's right-hand man.  And in</P>
<P> 2    Serbia we didn't send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.</P>
<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something</P>
<P> 4    for me in relation to the Prosecution's case.  In the Bosnia indictment</P>
<P> 5    the allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other</P>
<P> 6    members of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the</P>
<P> 7    Prosecution case unfolded, you're not saying, are you, that he acted</P>
<P> 8    alone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with</P>
<P> 9    other members of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>
<P>10            MR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven't reviewed each and every allegation</P>
<P>11    to check that there isn't one there that may be susceptible to individual</P>
<P>12    perpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.</P>
<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he's working with others.</P>
<P>14            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>
<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually</P>
<P>16    your case.  It's not that he acted alone.</P>
<P>17            MR. NICE:  Subject to the point I've just made.</P>
<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you've made, yes.</P>
<P>19            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>
<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Thank you.</P>
<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>22       Q.   Very well, Mr. Seselj.  You've just heard that explanation too.</P>
<P>23    Now, since you know the relationships very well between people at that</P>
<P>24    time, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and</P>
<P>25    Zvornik yourself.  Now, did I or any organs of power and authority have</P>

<P> 1    anything to do with Arkan's volunteer guard?</P>
<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet.</P>
<P> 3            MR. NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and</P>
<P> 4    I think perhaps there's this qualification, although I don't think it is a</P>
<P> 5    qualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this</P>
<P> 6    accused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top</P>
<P> 7    political level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are</P>
<P> 8    criminal in nature.  It's the standard method of generation of</P>
<P> 9    genocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar</P>
<P>10    [phoen].</P>
<P>11            Now, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other</P>
<P>12    people.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may</P>
<P>13    be minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in</P>
<P>14    those circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting</P>
<P>15    alone in certain circumstances, but that's the only qualification I think</P>
<P>16    I should make.</P>
<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it's a point that will warrant some</P>
<P>18    consideration later on, yes.</P>
<P>19            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>20            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>21       Q.   So Arkan is mentioned here as well as Mauzer.  Did I or anybody</P>
<P>22    else from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all</P>
<P>23    and with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?</P>
<P>24       A.   I'm quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.</P>
<P>25    On the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43672 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    contacts with Arkan.</P>
<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many</P>
<P> 3    questions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the</P>
<P> 4    evidence he's giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,</P>
<P> 5    how is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan</P>
<P> 6    or Mauzer?</P>
<P> 7            He's giving evidence.  He's saying that you had nothing to do with</P>
<P> 8    him.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to</P>
<P> 9    establish how he's in a position to make that statement.</P>
<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>11       Q.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that</P>
<P>12    cannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from</P>
<P>13    the authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or</P>
<P>14    relationship with Arkan or Mauzer?</P>
<P>15       A.   In Belgrade you couldn't hide anything like that.  It would be</P>
<P>16    impossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is</P>
<P>17    that kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become</P>
<P>18    public.</P>
<P>19            Second, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts</P>
<P>20    only with Zoran Djindjic.  And I've already spoken about the relationship</P>
<P>21    between Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic's vice-president and the</P>
<P>22    president of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his</P>
<P>23    pre-electoral campaign.</P>
<P>24       Q.   Let's clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did</P>
<P>25    you have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43673 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    able to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in</P>
<P> 2    Bijeljina?</P>
<P> 3       A.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina</P>
<P> 4    sufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,</P>
<P> 5    including Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this</P>
<P> 6    trial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events</P>
<P> 7    that went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in</P>
<P> 8    Bijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements</P>
<P> 9    and held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and</P>
<P>10    severely criticised Mauzer's conduct, especially Mauzer's conduct towards</P>
<P>11    the Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am</P>
<P>12    preparing them for my own trial, which doesn't seem to be starting.</P>
<P>13       Q.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack</P>
<P>14    on the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the</P>
<P>15    JNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by</P>
<P>16    the Red Berets or, rather, Arkan's and Seselj's men.  So that's the</P>
<P>17    quotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan's</P>
<P>18    and Seselj's men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red</P>
<P>19    Berets were they?  What Arkan's men were they, Seselj's men were they</P>
<P>20    around Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?</P>
<P>21       A.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the</P>
<P>22    witness don't seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened</P>
<P>23    to see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red</P>
<P>24    cap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.</P>
<P>25    And then he -- the witness doesn't know whether they were Seselj's men or</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43674 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Arkan's men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it's</P>
<P> 2    highly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of</P>
<P> 3    his head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify</P>
<P> 4    so-called Seselj's men and Arkan's men and these alleged Red Berets.</P>
<P> 5            As for the Red Berets, I've already given you reliable facts about</P>
<P> 6    them and said that name appeared in different situations relating to</P>
<P> 7    different military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina</P>
<P> 8    area where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then</P>
<P> 9    the army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of</P>
<P>10    the intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until</P>
<P>11    the special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of</P>
<P>12    Serbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this</P>
<P>13    misunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed</P>
<P>14    to people with -- which they had nothing to do with.</P>
<P>15       Q.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the</P>
<P>16    following:  "Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>
<P>17    who were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done."</P>
<P>18    That's when this witness claims.</P>
<P>19       A.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He's a colonel by</P>
<P>20    rank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff</P>
<P>21    of the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the</P>
<P>22    number two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that's the same</P>
<P>23    Osman Selak that you're referring to.</P>
<P>24       Q.   Well, I can't tell you that.</P>
<P>25       A.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43675 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Republika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a</P>
<P> 2    statement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,</P>
<P> 3    what the circumstances were in which I said it.</P>
<P> 4            I did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the</P>
<P> 5    secession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia</P>
<P> 6    seceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,</P>
<P> 7    and for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he</P>
<P> 8    personally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.</P>
<P> 9            As far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from</P>
<P>10    Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of</P>
<P>11    Yugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and</P>
<P>12    Raska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of</P>
<P>13    examples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army</P>
<P>14    perform their duty very honourably.</P>
<P>15            So the citizens --</P>
<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>
<P>17            JUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are</P>
<P>18    saying that you did make such a statement or you didn't make such a</P>
<P>19    statement.</P>
<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if</P>
<P>21    you don't show me something like that here, where and when.  Let us see</P>
<P>22    the statement concerned.  Let me identify it.  I gave thousands and</P>
<P>23    thousands of statements in public.  They were publicly recorded.  They</P>
<P>24    were published.  So let's see.</P>
<P>25            My objection is precisely in that.  Why did this Osman Selak not</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43676 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    say where and when?</P>
<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's helpful to some extent.  Does it follow from</P>
<P> 3    the answer you've just given that you could have said it?</P>
<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I could have said it along the</P>
<P> 5    following lines, that those in the army who came from the renegade</P>
<P> 6    republics in principle should not remain at positions in the Yugoslav</P>
<P> 7    army.  You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live</P>
<P> 8    in Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in</P>
<P> 9    the army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as</P>
<P>10    officers?</P>
<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's simply confusing me further.  The quote was</P>
<P>12    that you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims</P>
<P>13    and Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that</P>
<P>14    you could possibly have made that statement in these terms?</P>
<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not saying that I made that kind</P>
<P>16    of statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak</P>
<P>17    testified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise</P>
<P>18    lines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman</P>
<P>19    Selak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be</P>
<P>20    established.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the</P>
<P>21    Prosecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly</P>
<P>22    what I said.</P>
<P>23            I am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,</P>
<P>24    but it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you're asking me to do is</P>
<P>25    to comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43677 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Selak's view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make</P>
<P> 2    my statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.</P>
<P> 3            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm</P>
<P> 4    trying to understand the answer you've given to the question asked by</P>
<P> 5    Mr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you've just said, the problem is</P>
<P> 6    that you've been studying this yourself, and you're trying to justify a</P>
<P> 7    position of your own without really dealing specifically with the question</P>
<P> 8    that's being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears</P>
<P> 9    now to be that you couldn't possibly have made a statement of that nature,</P>
<P>10    although you might have said something much more specific about different</P>
<P>11    people but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.</P>
<P>12            Now, is that a fair summary of your position?</P>
<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I'm not sure, by think you're</P>
<P>14    very close.  However, in order to help you, I'm going to give you an</P>
<P>15    example.</P>
<P>16            Throughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were</P>
<P>17    informed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,</P>
<P>18    escaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of</P>
<P>19    confidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998</P>
<P>20    we had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of</P>
<P>21    the military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his</P>
<P>22    family abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives</P>
<P>23    there.</P>
<P>24            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn't remotely sound as if it's</P>
<P>25    going to be at all helpful to me, so we'll proceed with Mr. Milosevic's</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43678 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    questions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you</P>
<P> 2    was about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist</P>
<P> 3    statement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple</P>
<P> 4    issue I'm not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further</P>
<P> 5    if he wishes.</P>
<P> 6            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --</P>
<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.</P>
<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --</P>
<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.</P>
<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in</P>
<P>11    no uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that</P>
<P>12    any statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never</P>
<P>13    in my life have I made a racist statement.</P>
<P>14            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.</P>
<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.</P>
<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.</P>
<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>18       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>
<P>19            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.</P>
<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  There's nothing for you to respond to.</P>
<P>21            Mr. Milosevic, the next question.</P>
<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>23       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I'm afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I</P>
<P>24    put a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific</P>
<P>25    terms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43679 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    here that "Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>
<P> 2    who were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed."  Did you ever state</P>
<P> 3    that?</P>
<P> 4       A.   No, I didn't say it that way.</P>
<P> 5       Q.   So you didn't say it that way --</P>
<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... matter.</P>
<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  And why on earth it should take all this time to</P>
<P> 8    establish that simple issue, I do not know.</P>
<P> 9            Perhaps it would help, Mr. Seselj, if you just listened to the</P>
<P>10    questions and answer the question that's actually asked rather than try to</P>
<P>11    make political statements about your own position.</P>
<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic --</P>
<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not making political statements,</P>
<P>14    Mr. Bonomy.</P>
<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>16       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He</P>
<P>17    mentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether</P>
<P>18    those facts are correct.  And first of all, I'm interested in the</P>
<P>19    circumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  "Just after</P>
<P>20    the bombing Seselj came to Pale."  And then on page 26762 he</P>
<P>21    says:  "Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to</P>
<P>22    support the Bosnian Serbs."  These are a few facts that referred to.</P>
<P>23    Could you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this</P>
<P>24    actually all about?</P>
<P>25       A.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43680 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Republika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the</P>
<P> 2    leadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly</P>
<P> 3    engaged in an anti-Serb policy.</P>
<P> 4            As for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market</P>
<P> 5    itself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the</P>
<P> 6    street of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these</P>
<P> 7    are explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of</P>
<P> 8    whether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar</P>
<P> 9    shells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.</P>
<P>10            This was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the</P>
<P>11    Serbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the</P>
<P>12    threats that were made, and so on and so forth.</P>
<P>13       Q.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there</P>
<P>14    you did so only to give political support to the leadership of</P>
<P>15    Republika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and</P>
<P>16    bombing.</P>
<P>17       A.   Yes.</P>
<P>18       Q.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  "In January or February</P>
<P>19    1992" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, "Arkan's</P>
<P>20    and Seselj's units arrived in Doboj."</P>
<P>21            Is this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?</P>
<P>22       A.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,</P>
<P>23    there were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.</P>
<P>24            Secondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to</P>
<P>25    Doboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan's Tigers never</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43681 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    operated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.</P>
<P> 2       Q.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to</P>
<P> 3    this question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on</P>
<P> 4    transcript page 27738, quite explicitly, "Mirko Blagojevic," that is to</P>
<P> 5    say, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he</P>
<P> 6    says:  "Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,</P>
<P> 7    and he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with</P>
<P> 8    Seselj."</P>
<P> 9            I am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical</P>
<P>10    Party or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that</P>
<P>11    Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So</P>
<P>12    please deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the</P>
<P>13    transcript.  Is it correct or not?</P>
<P>14       A.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is</P>
<P>15    organised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A</P>
<P>16    conflict occurs when two armed formations clash.</P>
<P>17            Mirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in</P>
<P>18    Bijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim</P>
<P>19    formations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any</P>
<P>20    conflicts.  And I guarantee with my own life that he took part in no</P>
<P>21    looting, no persecutions, no maltreatment of the civilian population and</P>
<P>22    so on and so forth.  I'm absolutely certain of that.</P>
<P>23       Q.   Thank you.</P>
<P>24       A.   I can fully identify with everything that Mirko Blagojevic did.</P>
<P>25    It is to that degree that I'm certain that he never did anything against</P>

<P> 1    the law.</P>
<P> 2       Q.   Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  "Seselj's</P>
<P> 3    men tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm."</P>
<P> 4       A.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?</P>
<P> 5       Q.   My understanding is it's somewhere near Zvornik.</P>
<P> 6       A.   That's quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>
<P> 7    Party took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there</P>
<P> 8    in brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on</P>
<P> 9    for a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the</P>
<P>10    Muslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to</P>
<P>11    an end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>
<P>12    withdrew.</P>
<P>13            I preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on</P>
<P>14    guarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing</P>
<P>15    happened, I would have had to know about it.</P>
<P>16       Q.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you</P>
<P>17    personally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following</P>
<P>18    circumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  "Seselj,</P>
<P>19    on Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired</P>
<P>20    it at Muslims in Sarajevo."  This was shown on television, and he said</P>
<P>21    that you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.</P>
<P>22       A.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at</P>
<P>23    Grbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called</P>
<P>24    international observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go</P>
<P>25    around the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43684 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Serb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was</P>
<P> 2    an apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I</P>
<P> 3    used a Browning machine-gun from there.  It's a heavy machine-gun.  I</P>
<P> 4    couldn't carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry</P>
<P> 5    it around.</P>
<P> 6       Q.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.</P>
<P> 7       A.   You cannot carry it.  It's too long.  It was installed in that</P>
<P> 8    building, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches</P>
<P> 9    below the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of</P>
<P>10    the volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was</P>
<P>11    firing from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and</P>
<P>12    the top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is</P>
<P>13    something I don't know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who</P>
<P>14    could have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this</P>
<P>15    small participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.</P>
<P>16            A Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that</P>
<P>17    case, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been</P>
<P>18    forced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of</P>
<P>19    those who in violation of international law of war brought him out there</P>
<P>20    to dig trenches, not those who --</P>
<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>
<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>23       Q.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,</P>
<P>24    that at the beginning of April Seselj's men arrived in the area of</P>
<P>25    Bratunac and Zvornik.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43685 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1       A.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic's part.  He knows</P>
<P> 2    full well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing</P>
<P> 3    who he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and</P>
<P> 4    making this sweeping statement Seselj's men arrived in Bratunac and</P>
<P> 5    Zvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it's as if they were in Bratunac</P>
<P> 6    too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so</P>
<P> 7    Deronjic invented that.</P>
<P> 8            In Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the</P>
<P> 9    Bratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was</P>
<P>10    commander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he</P>
<P>11    was not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,</P>
<P>12    then a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.</P>
<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.  I think the interpreter is having</P>
<P>14    some difficulty.</P>
<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will.</P>
<P>16            You could have noticed, Mr. Robinson, that I have been trying as</P>
<P>17    of late to speak slowly, but sometimes, every now and then, I may forget</P>
<P>18    what you cautioned me about.</P>
<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, I had noticed, and the -- we are</P>
<P>20    appreciative of the effort you are making.  You have answered the</P>
<P>21    question.</P>
<P>22            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the meantime --</P>
<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think you have answered that question.</P>
<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>25       Q.   So they were not in Bratunac at all?</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43686 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1       A.   No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in</P>
<P> 2    Bratunac.</P>
<P> 3       Q.   All right.  So you are saying that he's not telling the truth.</P>
<P> 4            The same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not</P>
<P> 5    agree that Seselj was a true opposition.</P>
<P> 6       A.   The Hague OTP and Judge Schomburg on several occasions caught</P>
<P> 7    Deronjic lying.  And even in Deronjic's judgement you can find about seven</P>
<P> 8    different points as ascertained by Judge Schomburg, namely that Deronjic</P>
<P> 9    was lying.</P>
<P>10            Secondly, in the case of people who are inclined to a pro-Western</P>
<P>11    policy or are mercenaries of Western intelligence agencies, or in order to</P>
<P>12    save their own skin they go into plea bargaining with the OTP and</P>
<P>13    therefore appear as witnesses in the trials of other people, it can often</P>
<P>14    be heard that those who are really opposition but are not prepared to</P>
<P>15    serve the West --</P>
<P>16            MR. NICE:  I'm not sure this is responsive to any question --</P>
<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Are you interrupting me?</P>
<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet, Mr. Seselj, and he's</P>
<P>19    entitled to make an objection if he wishes.</P>
<P>20            MR. NICE:  He was simply asked if the man was telling the truth.</P>
<P>21    We have his answer and he's now gone on to a long comment basically.</P>
<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, you have moved into the area of comment.</P>
<P>23            It's now time for the break.</P>
<P>24            Mr. Nice, I should say the question that I asked earlier related</P>
<P>25    to the Bosnia indictment.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43687 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1            We will break for 20 minutes.</P>
<P> 2                          --- Recess taken at 3.41 p.m.</P>
<P> 3                          --- On resuming at 4.08 p.m.</P>
<P> 4            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, you told me to check</P>
<P> 6    the pages that Mr. Nice mentioned, 35 -- 20352 and 20351, that is.  This</P>
<P> 7    was Witness 1070.</P>
<P> 8            On page 20351 he says that Seselj's men were in Bratunac and that</P>
<P> 9    there was no difference between them and Seselj's men, the White Eagles,</P>
<P>10    that is.</P>
<P>11            And on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April</P>
<P>12    Seselj's and Arkan's men were in Bratunac together when some people were</P>
<P>13    deported.  And Mr. Seselj answered questions about this.  In the meantime,</P>
<P>14    the liaison officer had the transcript, and I have received a note saying</P>
<P>15    that both references are correct, both as regards page 20351 and 20352,</P>
<P>16    and these refer to Witness 1070.  There was no error.</P>
<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  All right, Mr. Milosevic.  We'll do our own</P>
<P>18    check.  Thank you for checking anyhow.</P>
<P>19            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>20       Q.   Mr. Seselj, this is the testimony of Miroslav Deronjic, who said</P>
<P>21    that you were not truly an opposition politician or, rather, that you</P>
<P>22    cooperated with the government and that therefore this idea of a joint</P>
<P>23    criminal enterprise is thereby confirmed.  Were you in the opposition or</P>
<P>24    not?</P>
<P>25            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43688 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it</P>
<P> 2    on.</P>
<P> 3            Both the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time</P>
<P> 4    were distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as</P>
<P> 5    it's possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by</P>
<P> 6    Deronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the</P>
<P> 7    opposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint</P>
<P> 8    often expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various</P>
<P> 9    government and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person</P>
<P>10    of the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or</P>
<P>11    Miles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery</P>
<P>12    and so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while</P>
<P>13    criticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition</P>
<P>14    politicians, and this logic is completely upside down.</P>
<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>16       Q.   Witness Ahmet Zulic says, and that's on page 30000 of the</P>
<P>17    transcript, he says that Seselj's men were stationed in the partisan</P>
<P>18    cemetery in Pobrezje, that doesn't matter so much but what matters is the</P>
<P>19    following, that they had come there to kill the Muslims.</P>
<P>20       A.   Where is this place?  Pobrezje?  Where is it?</P>
<P>21       Q.   I have a note here in Pobrezje.  I can't be more specific than</P>
<P>22    that.</P>
<P>23            But let me put a question to you:  Did your volunteers go anywhere</P>
<P>24    to kill all Muslims?</P>
<P>25       A.   No.  Nowhere did the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party go to</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43689 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    kill Muslims or Croats or any kind of civilians.  Wherever they went, they</P>
<P> 2    were part of the JNA, and they went there to fight against the</P>
<P> 3    paramilitary units that wanted to break up Yugoslavia.</P>
<P> 4            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, it's important to know the</P>
<P> 5    location.  I'm not sure whether Mr. Nice or Mr. Kay can help.  Your note</P>
<P> 6    doesn't identify clearly the name of this place?</P>
<P> 7            MR. NICE:  I tried to make an electronic search but for various</P>
<P> 8    reasons it doesn't work at the moment or doesn't work for this witness on</P>
<P> 9    this particular part of his evidence.  I'll try again.</P>
<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  You said Pobrezje.</P>
<P>12            Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>14       Q.   The same witness, Ahmet Zulic, on page 30047, says in Sanski Most</P>
<P>15    there was no fighting, but the civilians fled because Seselj's men were</P>
<P>16    there.</P>
<P>17            Your men caused fear among civilians, although there was no</P>
<P>18    fighting there, as he says, in Sanski Most.</P>
<P>19       A.   That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,</P>
<P>20    throughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did</P>
<P>21    not fight in any location.</P>
<P>22            This reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a</P>
<P>23    certain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying</P>
<P>24    that sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.</P>
<P>25    Somebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43690 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    arriving, and he spread panic.</P>
<P> 2            THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that the Serbian word for</P>
<P> 3    sugar resembles Mr. Seselj's name.</P>
<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere</P>
<P> 5    in that area.</P>
<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P> 7       Q.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  "From the</P>
<P> 8    1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan</P>
<P> 9    Milosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint</P>
<P>10    criminal," and so on,"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise</P>
<P>11    aided and abetted," and so on and so forth, all these phrases, "the</P>
<P>12    planning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories</P>
<P>13    of Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>
<P>14    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica."</P>
<P>15            Tell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in</P>
<P>16    this joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged</P>
<P>17    crimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made</P>
<P>18    here?</P>
<P>19       A.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from</P>
<P>20    Serbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia</P>
<P>21    and Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted</P>
<P>22    to proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the</P>
<P>23    will of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the</P>
<P>24    West who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or</P>
<P>25    execution or extermination.  There was no plan.</P>

<P> 1            When the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in</P>
<P> 2    many places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only</P>
<P> 3    where the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats</P>
<P> 4    were in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,</P>
<P> 5    not a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the</P>
<P> 6    majority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They</P>
<P> 7    had already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.</P>
<P> 8       Q.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we</P>
<P> 9    have already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the</P>
<P>10    other places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>
<P>11    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in</P>
<P>12    any kind of military activities?</P>
<P>13       A.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in</P>
<P>14    January, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but</P>
<P>15    the UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,</P>
<P>16    although they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was</P>
<P>17    established, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be</P>

<P>18    disarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.</P>
<P>19            The Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian</P>
<P>20    villages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there</P>
<P>21    were two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active</P>
<P>22    in the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces</P>
<P>23    in the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the</P>
<P>24    only activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica</P>
<P>25    area.  It was in the beginning of 1993.</P>

<P> 1            As for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,</P>
<P> 2    I don't know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up</P>
<P> 3    only in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all</P>
<P> 4    over Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army</P>
<P> 5    of the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska</P>
<P> 6    Krajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his</P>
<P> 7    volunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars</P>
<P> 8    there, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.</P>
<P> 9       Q.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed</P>
<P>10    and what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy</P>
<P>11    that we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in</P>
<P>12    whole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and</P>
<P>13    Herzegovina?</P>
<P>14       A.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and</P>
<P>15    there was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen</P>
<P>16    happened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on</P>
<P>17    their own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit</P>
<P>18    murders or anything of the kind.</P>
<P>19       Q.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war</P>
<P>20    in Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the</P>
<P>21    other participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by</P>
<P>22    Mr. Nice.</P>
<P>23            Look at paragraph 33.  We've just been discussing paragraph 32.  I</P>
<P>24    won't read the beginning of paragraph 33 because it's the same:  "From on</P>
<P>25    or about the 1st of March, 1992," and so on and so forth, and then it</P>

<P> 1    says:  "On the territory of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa,</P>
<P> 2    Bosanski Novi, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Sarajevo (Ilijas), Kljuc,</P>

<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You are finished reading that list.  Let me</P>
<P> 7    remind you, Mr. Milosevic, that the Rule 98 bis decision found that there</P>
<P> 8    was not enough evidence to support the allegation in paragraph 32 in</P>
<P> 9    relation to some of the villages or municipalities mentioned.  In fact, as</P>
<P>10    far as paragraph 32 is concerned, you need only concern yourself with</P>
<P>11    Brcko, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Bijeljina, Kotor Varos, Kljuc,</P>
<P>12    Bosanski Novi.  And I am checking to see whether the decision affected</P>
<P>13    paragraph 33.</P>
<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, could you please let</P>
<P>15    me know what evidence, as you say there was no evidence for these places,</P>
<P>16    but what was the evidence that Mr. Nice presented here about the other</P>
<P>17    places linking me --</P>
<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.  Mr. Milosevic, the Rule 98 bis</P>
<P>19    decision was published and was available to you.  But I bring that to your</P>
<P>20    attention so we don't waste time.  And I'll ask the legal officer to give</P>
<P>21    me the information in relation to paragraph 33.</P>
<P>22            Go ahead, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>23            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>24       Q.   As I was saying, Mr. Seselj, I read out a list here.  It's a long</P>
<P>25    paragraph with all the names of the towns where I, together with others,</P>

<P> 1    am charged with working for the extermination of Muslims and Croats.  You</P>
<P> 2    know the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that</P>
<P> 3    referred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded</P>
<P> 4    in any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?</P>
<P> 5       A.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted</P>
<P> 6    to, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A</P>
<P> 7    civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally</P>
<P> 8    wanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a</P>
<P> 9    constituent people.</P>
<P>10            And the question arises from there where are the Serbs from</P>
<P>11    Mostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from</P>
<P>12    Travnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from</P>
<P>13    many other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats</P>
<P>14    during that civil war?</P>
<P>15            After the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the</P>
<P>16    population, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did</P>
<P>17    take place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,</P>
<P>18    in figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I</P>
<P>19    can put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes</P>
<P>20    crimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,</P>
<P>21    sometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,</P>
<P>22    criminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and</P>
<P>23    revenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes</P>
<P>24    did not exist.  That did not happen.</P>
<P>25       Q.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43696 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    joint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I'd like</P>
<P> 2    to draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of</P>
<P> 3    December, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33</P>
<P> 4    and indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns</P>
<P> 5    are repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns</P>
<P> 6    too.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.</P>
<P> 7            So what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during</P>
<P> 8    that period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of</P>
<P> 9    December 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring</P>
<P>10    Bosnia and Herzegovina?</P>
<P>11       A.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia</P>
<P>12    or, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of</P>
<P>13    Yugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It</P>
<P>14    did not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help</P>
<P>15    materially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs</P>
<P>16    living over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different</P>
<P>17    political relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership</P>
<P>18    of Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in</P>
<P>19    which those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep</P>
<P>20    conflicts, and they didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues.</P>
<P>21            So throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the</P>
<P>22    indictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,</P>
<P>23    the leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered</P>
<P>24    in looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far</P>
<P>25    accepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43697 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    attacked ourselves for our part.</P>
<P> 2            So I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy</P>
<P> 3    dating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact</P>
<P> 4    that that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all</P>
<P> 5    costs.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no</P>
<P> 6    alternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at</P>
<P> 7    the price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept</P>
<P> 8    because they were not able to take such great concessions.</P>
<P> 9       Q.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities</P>
<P>10    of that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these</P>
<P>11    towns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I</P>
<P>12    personally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,</P>
<P>13    et cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason</P>
<P>14    explanation?</P>
<P>15       A.   Yes, I do, and that's explanation is the following and the fact</P>
<P>16    that through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,</P>
<P>17    and --</P>
<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not</P>
<P>19    an explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.</P>
<P>20            So please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,</P>
<P>23    Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac</P>
<P>24    again, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in</P>
<P>25    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43698 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with</P>
<P> 2    regard to that point of the indictment?</P>
<P> 3       A.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised</P>
<P> 4    crime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don't know whether in all the</P>
<P> 5    places enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took</P>
<P> 6    place in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each</P>
<P> 7    individual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the</P>
<P> 8    motives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are</P>
<P> 9    still living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can</P>
<P>10    be established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side</P>
<P>11    and the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to</P>
<P>12    investigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to</P>
<P>13    strike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the</P>
<P>14    number of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.</P>
<P>15       Q.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you've said when you said</P>
<P>16    that some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let's look at</P>
<P>17    that for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of</P>
<P>18    Yugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or</P>
<P>19    formations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes</P>
<P>20    that you know of?  Are there any links?</P>
<P>21       A.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of</P>
<P>22    power and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as</P>
<P>23    well, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,</P>
<P>24    the Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the</P>
<P>25    Academy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43699 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    everybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out</P>
<P> 2    against them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for</P>
<P> 3    freedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were</P>
<P> 4    being perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes</P>
<P> 5    should be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind</P>
<P> 6    via the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political</P>
<P> 7    parties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which</P>
<P> 8    strove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors</P>
<P> 9    spoke out against crimes.</P>
<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>
<P>11            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>12       Q.   Now, we -- let's look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful</P>
<P>13    confinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,</P>
<P>14    Bosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the</P>
<P>15    territories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,</P>
<P>16    Samac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,</P>
<P>17    Kotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,</P>
<P>18    Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.</P>
<P>19            Tell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these</P>
<P>20    people in these towns did we take part in?</P>
<P>21       A.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have</P>
<P>22    had anything to do with any such thing.</P>
<P>23            First of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What</P>
<P>24    the confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of</P>
<P>25    civilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43700 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    unlawful, and there were such cases.</P>
<P> 2            Now, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of</P>
<P> 3    all, there were individual instances in some of these places through the</P>
<P> 4    self-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance</P>
<P> 5    of Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.</P>
<P> 6    And then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of</P>
<P> 7    their own because they couldn't influence him.  He appeared as a factor,</P>
<P> 8    and there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his</P>
<P> 9    motives were of a criminal nature.</P>
<P>10            There were other such cases in some of these places whereby</P>
<P>11    somebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in</P>
<P>12    order to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive</P>
<P>13    money and then release them once they received money for that.  There were</P>
<P>14    also instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,</P>
<P>15    somebody's family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or</P>
<P>16    Croats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often</P>
<P>17    were not able to prevent revenge of that kind.</P>
<P>18       Q.   Which authorities?</P>
<P>19       A.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.</P>
<P>20       Q.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian</P>
<P>21    authorities intervene?</P>
<P>22       A.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn't influence or involve</P>
<P>23    themselves in any such matters.</P>
<P>24            So as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one</P>
<P>25    should take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43701 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    those cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and</P>
<P> 2    what the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.</P>
<P> 3            Now, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places</P>
<P> 4    where possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of</P>
<P> 5    context and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse</P>
<P> 6    top-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian</P>
<P> 7    Yugoslavia as well.</P>
<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has</P>
<P> 9    become a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you</P>
<P>10    say that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing</P>
<P>11    like the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged</P>
<P>12    by the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.</P>
<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn't understand me correctly,</P>
<P>14    Mr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,</P>
<P>15    but there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top</P>
<P>16    echelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely</P>
<P>17    impossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like</P>
<P>18    that, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is</P>
<P>19    impossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such</P>
<P>20    thing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did</P>
<P>21    commit crimes.  And it wasn't only individuals who committed crimes.</P>
<P>22    There was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.</P>
<P>23    And I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my</P>
<P>24    information, but I can't be well-versed in everything, but I can in</P>
<P>25    basics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43702 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    wasn't the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit</P>
<P> 2    crimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn't the policy of the</P>
<P> 3    leadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.</P>
<P> 4            Now, --</P>
<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn't the policy of this accused in</P>
<P> 6    concert with other --</P>
<P> 7            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of</P>
<P> 8    Mr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,</P>
<P> 9    continuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such</P>
<P>10    crimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the</P>
<P>11    most serious form of war crimes.</P>
<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>14       Q.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There's an enormous</P>
<P>15    list of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,</P>
<P>16    and the subject here is deportation.</P>
<P>17            Now, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let's clarify that.  Albeit in</P>
<P>18    Serbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,</P>
<P>19    Muslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,</P>
<P>20    70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle</P>
<P>21    of non-discrimination like anybody else.</P>
<P>22            Now, I can't clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is</P>
<P>23    being accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it</P>
<P>24    stated here -- it says:  "Milosevic, acting alone or together with other</P>
<P>25    members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43703 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or</P>
<P> 2    execution of the unlawful forcible transfer..."</P>
<P> 3            Now, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic</P>
<P> 4    of Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or</P>
<P> 5    unlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful</P>
<P> 6    movement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one</P>
<P> 7    individual?</P>
<P> 8       A.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with</P>
<P> 9    anything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these</P>
<P>10    phenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what</P>
<P>11    did happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group</P>
<P>12    to leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that</P>
<P>13    desire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were</P>
<P>14    instances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,</P>
<P>15    that people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,</P>
<P>16    something afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind</P>
<P>17    what had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to</P>
<P>18    move out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or</P>
<P>19    perhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they</P>
<P>20    were the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and</P>
<P>21    in some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established</P>
<P>22    in some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete</P>
<P>23    example, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from</P>
<P>24    Prijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a</P>
<P>25    convoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --</P>

<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I'm stopping you because you have</P>
<P> 2    answered the question.  You are becoming a little too expansive.</P>
<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think that this would be very</P>
<P> 4    important.</P>
<P> 5            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P> 6       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what example do you know of personally?</P>
<P> 7       A.   I'm talking about one example when Muslims were transported</P>
<P> 8    because they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And</P>
<P> 9    then the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose</P>
<P>10    name is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is</P>
<P>11    called Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large</P>
<P>12    group of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the</P>
<P>13    authorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part</P>
<P>14    of Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army</P>
<P>15    of Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.</P>
<P>16            Then he tried to explain this in a completely different way:</P>
<P>17    Somebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he's</P>
<P>18    trying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.</P>
<P>19            Such people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,</P>
<P>20    entered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and</P>
<P>21    then they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed</P>
<P>22    although they are invariably false because --</P>
<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm stopping you.  Mr. Seselj, no doubt you're a</P>
<P>24    man of many virtues.  Is omniscience one of them?  How do you happen to</P>
<P>25    know all these things?  I have to ask myself that question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>

<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson --</P>
<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Where is your knowledge coming from?</P>
<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, all my life I have</P>
<P> 4    been learning, learning, learning, and constantly learning.  Even now in</P>
<P> 5    prison I read eight to ten hours a day, although the conditions under</P>
<P> 6    which I live are very poor because they want to prevent me from preparing</P>
<P> 7    my defence case properly.  But I'm a constant learner, and I wish others</P>
<P> 8    were too.</P>
<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  It would help my appreciation of your evidence if</P>
<P>10    only occasionally we were told of the basis for the information that you</P>
<P>11    have about specific matters.</P>
<P>12            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of</P>
<P>15    Serbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and</P>
<P>16    that as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon</P>
<P>17    what do you base this statement?</P>
<P>18       A.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I</P>
<P>19    base my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent</P>
<P>20    statements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.</P>
<P>21            Secondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.</P>
<P>22    They never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never</P>
<P>23    discriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the</P>
<P>24    authorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in</P>
<P>25    Bosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia</P>

<P> 1    and treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.</P>
<P> 2            So there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic</P>
<P> 3    whatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution</P>
<P> 4    of Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in</P>
<P> 5    Serbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal</P>
<P> 6    of money.  Perhaps not all of them were happy with what they got, but this</P>
<P> 7    involved major expenditure on the part of the state.</P>
<P> 8       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  But did the authorities of Serbia allow</P>
<P> 9    discrimination over any Muslim Croat or the member of any other ethnic</P>
<P>10    group in Serbia during the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia?</P>
<P>11       A.   No.  Even if there were any incidents on ethnic grounds, the</P>
<P>12    authorities acted in accordance with the law and brought such matters to</P>
<P>13    trial.  They simply did not allow things like that to happen.</P>
<P>14       Q.   Please look at paragraph 42 now.  Again it says here:  "Slobodan</P>
<P>15    Milosevic," and so on and so forth, on or about the 1st of March, 1992,</P>
<P>16    until 391st of December, 1995, acting alone or in concert with members of</P>
<P>17    the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or</P>
<P>18    otherwise aided and abetted the planning preparation or execution of</P>
<P>19    wanton destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the</P>
<P>20    Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations and then" --</P>
<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, too fast.  Too fast.</P>
<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>23       Q.   So I, Mr. Seselj, according to this paragraph 42, aided and</P>
<P>24    abetted the planning, preparation or execution, I executed this.  It</P>
<P>25    wasn't that I only aided and abetted others, but I committed wanton</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43708 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the Bosnian</P>
<P> 2    Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations, and again all these</P>
<P> 3    municipalities are listed here where I committed wanton looting of</P>
<P> 4    property belonging to Muslims and Croats.</P>
<P> 5            Please tell us not only what you know about this but also on the</P>
<P> 6    basis of what you know what you know.</P>
<P> 7       A.   This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in</P>
<P> 8    any way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of</P>
<P> 9    private and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three</P>
<P>10    sides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything</P>
<P>11    under control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.</P>
<P>12            What happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims</P>
<P>13    would loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have</P>
<P>14    their own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar</P>
<P>15    way in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no</P>
<P>16    official authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No</P>
<P>17    one personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,</P>
<P>18    et cetera.</P>
<P>19            There were paramilitary formations that had looting as their</P>
<P>20    primary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also</P>
<P>21    from Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People</P>
<P>22    travelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize</P>
<P>23    their car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were</P>
<P>24    such cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial</P>
<P>25    Chamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43709 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    looting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions</P>
<P> 2    that were rather chaotic.</P>
<P> 3            There was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.</P>
<P> 4    Not only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika</P>
<P> 5    Srpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.</P>
<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in</P>
<P> 7    a military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto</P>
<P> 8    civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and</P>
<P> 9    wounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.</P>
<P>10            You were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please</P>
<P>11    explain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,</P>
<P>12    tell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of</P>
<P>13    Yugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.</P>
<P>14       A.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a</P>
<P>15    dissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict</P>
<P>16    in Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of</P>
<P>17    the duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case</P>
<P>18    elsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on</P>
<P>19    both sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less</P>
<P>20    casualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what</P>
<P>21    Judge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I</P>
<P>22    read.</P>
<P>23            I was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the</P>
<P>24    killing of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted</P>
<P>25    intentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43710 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Muslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present</P>
<P> 2    this in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,</P>
<P> 3    Vasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not</P>
<P> 4    take part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official</P>
<P> 5    factors from Serbia, that is.</P>
<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.  On the transcript it's a double</P>
<P> 7    negative.</P>
<P> 8            Yes, Mr. --</P>
<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] There is a double negative in the</P>
<P>10    Serbian language and it does not change the meaning of the statement.  In</P>
<P>11    English it might mean something different.  I'm sorry I don't know English</P>
<P>12    and I cannot really adjust to this.</P>
<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or</P>
<P>15    deny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took</P>
<P>16    part in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you</P>
<P>17    confirm that?</P>
<P>18       A.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.</P>
<P>19       Q.   All right.  Thank you.</P>
<P>20       A.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The</P>
<P>21    Muslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the</P>
<P>22    liberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.</P>
<P>23       Q.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his</P>
<P>24    witness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,</P>
<P>25    including women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43711 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1       A.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only</P>
<P> 2    logical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee</P>
<P> 3    from war.  They're fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.</P>
<P> 4            Very often in this war and in any other war civilians would get</P>
<P> 5    killed by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from</P>
<P> 6    the conflict.</P>
<P> 7       Q.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the</P>
<P> 8    Serbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it's supposed</P>
<P> 9    to seem?</P>
<P>10       A.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray</P>
<P>11    this, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their</P>
<P>12    victims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We</P>
<P>13    are faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is</P>
<P>14    based and anti-Serb grounds.</P>
<P>15       Q.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings</P>
<P>16    happened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all</P>
<P>17    of that can be found here in this indictment that I've been quoting to</P>
<P>18    you, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.</P>
<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to</P>
<P>20    give.  Ask another question.</P>
<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a</P>
<P>22    question to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that</P>
<P>23    he can give an answer.  He's a politician, an intellectual, a university</P>
<P>24    professor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,</P>
<P>25    and he is in a position to give an answer to this question.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43712 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And I've already ruled that he is not to answer</P>
<P> 2    it.  So proceed.</P>
<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>
<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P> 5       Q.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the</P>
<P> 6    JNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know</P>
<P> 7    about that?  This is on transcript page 20408.</P>
<P> 8       A.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The</P>
<P> 9    two sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the</P>
<P>10    bridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric</P>
<P>11    power plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to</P>
<P>12    destroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old</P>
<P>13    hydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the</P>
<P>14    paramilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The</P>
<P>15    conflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can't say exactly, I</P>
<P>16    wasn't there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And</P>
<P>17    then also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.</P>
<P>18       Q.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units</P>
<P>19    committed crimes in Zvornik.</P>
<P>20       A.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there</P>
<P>21    that can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but</P>
<P>22    who it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are</P>
<P>23    ascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to</P>
<P>24    Karadzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.</P>
<P>25            In Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43713 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    people for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.</P>
<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.</P>
<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P> 4       Q.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing</P>
<P> 5    them, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They</P>
<P> 6    are mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided</P>
<P> 7    by Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,</P>
<P> 8    Drinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you</P>
<P> 9    heard anything about this and what do you know about it?</P>
<P>10       A.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my</P>
<P>11    knowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but</P>
<P>12    once the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very</P>
<P>13    simply, who the victims were and who the executors were.</P>
<P>14       Q.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the</P>
<P>15    cultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many</P>
<P>16    persons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force</P>
<P>17    there is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I'll just go</P>
<P>18    on.</P>
<P>19       A.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were</P>
<P>20    committed.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn't the JNA that</P>
<P>21    took part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take</P>
<P>22    part in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully</P>
<P>23    investigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims</P>
<P>24    are still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether</P>
<P>25    there was enough will to investigate this matter, and I've already</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43714 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    referred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect</P>
<P> 2    a great deal from that.</P>
<P> 3       Q.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?</P>
<P> 4       A.   No, I don't know anything about it.  I wasn't there.</P>
<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj and Mr. Milosevic, you are not</P>
<P> 6    observing the pause between question and answer, and you are thereby</P>
<P> 7    creating difficulties for the interpreter.</P>
<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, this is the first time</P>
<P> 9    you have warned us about this today.  As you see, Mr. Seselj and I are</P>
<P>10    bearing this in mind.</P>
<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We're practising.</P>
<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>13       Q.   Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment</P>
<P>14    in this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your</P>
<P>15    units.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan's men.  Do</P>
<P>16    you have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your</P>
<P>17    units were there?  You've already explained you didn't have any units of</P>
<P>18    yours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers</P>
<P>19    were there?</P>
<P>20       A.   I'm not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik</P>
<P>21    area.  I know that Arkan's Tigers were active there but to what extent and</P>
<P>22    in what locations I couldn't say because I wasn't there.</P>
<P>23            All the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I</P>
<P>24    do not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and</P>
<P>25    misfortunes he talked about, but evidently he's very confused when</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43715 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    identifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He's mixing up Seselj's</P>
<P> 2    men, the White Eagles, Arkan's men, and this shows that he's very confused</P>
<P> 3    and unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers</P>
<P> 4    of the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to</P>
<P> 5    everything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very</P>
<P> 6    often it's beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn't be easy to</P>
<P> 7    establish who actually perpetrated this.</P>
<P> 8       Q.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a</P>
<P> 9    certain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the</P>
<P>10    transcript.  Do you know anything about this?</P>
<P>11       A.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>
<P>12    committed any crimes in that place.</P>
<P>13       Q.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb</P>
<P>14    Radical Party?</P>
<P>15       A.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party</P>
<P>16    sent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,</P>
<P>17    and as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me</P>
<P>18    had any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I'm sure of it.</P>
<P>19       Q.   Would other volunteers have reported this?</P>
<P>20       A.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and</P>
<P>21    they would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,</P>
<P>22    because this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.</P>
<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about</P>
<P>24    the conducts of the volunteers?</P>
<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn't say the reports were</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43716 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    regular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out</P>
<P> 2    how the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All</P>
<P> 3    the problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of</P>
<P> 4    indiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers</P>
<P> 5    to be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline</P>
<P> 6    of the other men.</P>
<P> 7            I was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the</P>
<P> 8    conclusion that none occurred.</P>
<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?</P>
<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral</P>
<P>11    conversations.</P>
<P>12            I'm convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written</P>
<P>13    reports would have been sent to me.  I'm sure that the competent command</P>
<P>14    would have told me had something like this happened.</P>
<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>16            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>17       Q.   Mr. Seselj, if you can't recall it doesn't matter, but is it true</P>
<P>18    that in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,</P>
<P>19    1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of</P>
<P>20    Seselj's men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?</P>
<P>21       A.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj's men, then</P>
<P>22    should be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell</P>
<P>23    you whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group</P>
<P>24    of Seselj's men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he's</P>
<P>25    the leader if they don't know his name?  What does the term "leader" mean?</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43717 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Was he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times</P>
<P> 2    that volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in</P>
<P> 3    units larger than a company.</P>
<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?</P>
<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I</P>
<P> 6    have a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I</P>
<P> 7    wanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the</P>
<P> 8    indictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no</P>
<P> 9    such instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>
<P>10    Party.</P>
<P>11            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>13       Q.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such</P>
<P>14    instances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various</P>
<P>15    allegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of</P>
<P>16    time.</P>
<P>17            Please tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about</P>
<P>18    the events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men</P>
<P>19    participated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.</P>
<P>20       A.   First of all --</P>
<P>21            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is that reference?</P>
<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I quoted about half an hour ago, but</P>
<P>23    it wasn't sufficiently clear.  I will try to find it again.  I'm simply</P>
<P>24    trying to establish whether the witness knows anything about</P>
<P>25    Bosanski Samac.</P>

<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have some knowledge but --</P>
<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  The answer -- the question I have is --  what do</P>
<P> 3    you mean by "because it says," it says, "that your men participated in</P>
<P> 4    taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992."  What is "it"?</P>
<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj something about</P>
<P> 6    Samac before, but right now I can't find it.</P>
<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  I take it it's not another reference to the</P>
<P> 8    indictment against Mr. Seselj.</P>
<P> 9            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I don't think it is.</P>
<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have Bosanski Samac mentioned in</P>
<P>11    several places on your indictment, if I can be of assistance, and I can</P>
<P>12    tell you what I know about the events in Bosanski Samac.</P>
<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>14       Q.   Well, that's the only reason I asked you whether you knew</P>
<P>15    anything.</P>
<P>16       A.   In paragraph 42 Bosanski Samac is ascribed to you.</P>
<P>17       Q.   Well, all the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are</P>
<P>18    ascribed to me.  There aren't any which are not ascribed to me.  But what</P>
<P>19    do you know about the events there?</P>
<P>20            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I don't understand this question.  You</P>
<P>21    can't just ask a question, take a municipality and say, "What do you know</P>
<P>22    about events there?"  There's got to be some point to the question.</P>
<P>23            Now, what is this dealing with?</P>
<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>25       Q.   Very well.  I won't ask you anything about that, then, because I</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43720 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    can't find the reference now.</P>
<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, Mr. Milosevic.  If you find the</P>
<P> 3    reference, you can come back to it, but bear in mind that you undertook to</P>
<P> 4    complete the evidence in chief today.</P>
<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I'm doing my best, Mr. Robinson, but</P>
<P> 6    there are many, many witnesses who mentioned Mr. Seselj, and I want to see</P>
<P> 7    whether there's any truth in anything they said.</P>
<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, you may -- Mr. Milosevic, you may have</P>
<P> 9    other witnesses who may be in a better position to contradict the</P>
<P>10    assertions in the Prosecution case than Mr. Seselj himself.  Don't assume</P>
<P>11    that because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he's the</P>
<P>12    best person to contradict it.</P>
<P>13            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.</P>
<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>15       Q.   On page 23520 of the transcript.  I'll skip over the witness's</P>
<P>16    name because I can't recall at present whether or not he was protected,</P>
<P>17    Mr. Robinson.  I don't think he was, because I don't have any note to that</P>
<P>18    effect, but he says:  "In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the</P>
<P>19    White Wolves, and the JNA participated."</P>
<P>20            Do you know anything about this?</P>
<P>21       A.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,</P>
<P>22    there was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from</P>
<P>23    Eastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the</P>
<P>24    indictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.</P>
<P>25    His name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43721 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    helicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was</P>
<P> 2    accompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>
<P> 3    Party, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for</P>
<P> 4    sure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also</P>
<P> 5    Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as</P>
<P> 6    the Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was</P>
<P> 7    charged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in</P>
<P> 8    Banja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>
<P> 9    Party.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and</P>
<P>10    the party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.</P>
<P>11       Q.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don't know that Kragujevac</P>
<P>12    is not in Bosnia.</P>
<P>13       A.   That's correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I'm getting ready</P>
<P>14    to obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was</P>
<P>15    expelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan</P>
<P>16    Savic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the</P>
<P>17    Serb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave</P>
<P>18    my legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial</P>
<P>19    and all the accompanying materials.</P>
<P>20            As for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to</P>
<P>21    me certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man</P>
<P>22    Radovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his</P>
<P>23    participation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.</P>
<P>24            Those are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members</P>
<P>25    of the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43722 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    had previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even</P>
<P> 2    called him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was</P>
<P> 3    Srecko Radovanovic.</P>
<P> 4            There was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was</P>
<P> 5    certainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was</P>
<P> 6    certainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been</P>
<P> 7    he would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that</P>
<P> 8    unit was called the Grey Wolves.</P>
<P> 9            JUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I've understood</P>
<P>10    from that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions</P>
<P>11    in Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you've said?</P>
<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,</P>
<P>13    yes.</P>
<P>14            JUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called</P>
<P>15    the Grey Wolves active there?</P>
<P>16            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it's very problematic to say</P>
<P>17    paramilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means</P>
<P>18    outside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial</P>
<P>19    Defence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I'm not</P>
<P>20    sure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,</P>
<P>21    I think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good</P>
<P>22    fighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what</P>
<P>23    happened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called</P>
<P>24    Crkvina or something like that.  I can't recall it all off the top of my</P>
<P>25    head, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43723 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Banja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.</P>
<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven't dealt with.  Did</P>
<P> 3    they participate?</P>
<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What</P>
<P> 5    Red Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?</P>
<P> 6            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's a perfectly legitimate answer for you to</P>
<P> 7    give, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the</P>
<P> 8    Red Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the</P>
<P> 9    quotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,</P>
<P>10    which on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they've got</P>
<P>11    nothing to do with the question.  So all I'm doing now is trying to find</P>
<P>12    out what the real answer to that question is.</P>
<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.</P>
<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the</P>
<P>15    Red Berets.</P>
<P>16                          --- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.</P>
<P>17                          --- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.</P>
<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the</P>
<P>19    technical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary</P>
<P>20    resulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected</P>
<P>21    witness.</P>
<P>22            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>23            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.</P>
<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>25       Q.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43724 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Wolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also</P>
<P> 2    mentioned.  Now, the witness, I don't know whether he was protected or</P>
<P> 3    not, I don't want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the</P>
<P> 4    transcript says that he saw 20 locals, and it's about Samac, wearing</P>
<P> 5    uniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed</P>
<P> 6    they were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned</P>
<P> 7    to Samac.  Do you know anything about that?</P>
<P> 8       A.   Well, I don't have any information to that effect, and that is</P>
<P> 9    quite impossible.  I'd like to point out once again that in different</P>
<P>10    places they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had</P>
<P>11    found some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have</P>
<P>12    been various units, especially as we're talking about locals in this</P>
<P>13    particular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What</P>
<P>14    does it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some</P>
<P>15    warehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they</P>
<P>16    were some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the</P>
<P>17    Red Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of</P>
<P>18    the State Security in 1996.</P>
<P>19            So quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term</P>
<P>20    applies to different concepts.</P>
<P>21       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I</P>
<P>22    think that is in the indictment against you but you'll put me right if I'm</P>
<P>23    wrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,</P>
<P>24    that is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,</P>
<P>25    wherein amongst others you said:  "Dear brother Chetniks, especially you</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43725 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    across the Drina, you're the bravest, and we're going to clear up Bosnia</P>
<P> 2    from the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong."  Is</P>
<P> 3    it true that you said that?</P>
<P> 4       A.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and</P>
<P> 5    partially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,</P>
<P> 6    because -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don't always know</P>
<P> 7    the Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an</P>
<P> 8    artificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the</P>
<P> 9    Croats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian</P>
<P>10    variation "pogan" means "pagan," where as in the Serb language "pogan"</P>
<P>11    means "waste" or "faeces."  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and</P>
<P>12    pan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called</P>
<P>13    them "pogani," which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the</P>
<P>14    Muslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I'm not a stupid</P>
<P>15    man.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have</P>
<P>16    nothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more</P>
<P>17    than I do to all the Christians afterwards, let's make that point clear,</P>
<P>18    but I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --</P>
<P>19    greatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims</P>
<P>20    to be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.</P>
<P>21            So here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion</P>
<P>22    is being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,</P>
<P>23    and I've been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,</P>
<P>24    Islamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they</P>
<P>25    first appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.</P>

<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>
<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?</P>
<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.  Well, if you</P>
<P> 4    haven't got if it in my books then the Prosecution probably has a copy</P>
<P> 5    because most of my speeches were published in my books, in my works so, if</P>
<P> 6    a speech does not happen to be there, if --</P>
<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  Was this one published in your books?  I apologise.</P>
<P> 8    I haven't read them all.</P>
<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson [sic], two years ago I</P>
<P>10    handed over to The Hague Tribunal 80 of my printed works.</P>
<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  Is this speech in any of them?</P>
<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Most probably, but it would be up to</P>
<P>13    the Prosecution to find it, not me.  I can't look through that whole</P>
<P>14    matter myself, because I didn't make the statement only in one place.  I</P>
<P>15    made the statement in several places, on several occasions.</P>
<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  Well, normally the party presenting the evidence is</P>
<P>17    responsible for getting it to court in some -- as official as is possible,</P>
<P>18    but you're not aware of a copy of it being available for us as part of the</P>
<P>19    papers in connection with your evidence.</P>
<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Bonomy, the side that has</P>
<P>21    referred to my alleged speech is the Prosecution's side.  So I'm just</P>
<P>22    telling you where they made a mistake.  So they can find the original of</P>
<P>23    the speech and present it here.  I can't do the work of the Prosecution.</P>
<P>24    I can't be expected to do that.  I am testifying to the facts and</P>
<P>25    circumstances about which I have knowledge.  I'm not here to help the</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43727 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Prosecution out in its work.  And for my part, I have contributed</P>
<P> 2    sufficiently by handing over all my books.  They have far greater</P>
<P> 3    resources than I do.</P>
<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Nice, can you help?  Where do I locate the</P>
<P> 5    evidence, readily locate the evidence in relation to this?</P>
<P> 6            MR. NICE:  I'm not sure you can locate it readily at the moment</P>
<P> 7    from our own database.  It may be possible.</P>
<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  It appears Mr. Seselj is suggesting that there is</P>
<P> 9    evidence of this speech led by the Prosecution in this case.</P>
<P>10            MR. NICE:  It may be in this case or it may be in the pre-trial</P>
<P>11    brief of his own case.  I'll deal with it as soon as I can.</P>
<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  All right.  Thank you.</P>
<P>13            MR. NICE:  We can't of course be guided in the way we are going to</P>
<P>14    present our questions through his observations.  We'll make our own</P>
<P>15    decisions.</P>
<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  No, no, no.  That's nothing to the point.  I'm just</P>
<P>17    trying to clarify where I can read this speech, but if no one's going to</P>
<P>18    help me, that's okay.</P>
<P>19            MR. NICE:  We certainly will help you when we can.</P>
<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>22       Q.   Witness B1643 who testified pursuant to 92 bis, I assume you know</P>
<P>23    the written part, mentioned torture and capture of civilians in the SUP</P>
<P>24    building of the Territorial Defence in the primary school and secondary</P>
<P>25    school in Crkvina, the warehouse there.  Do you know anything about that?</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43728 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1       A.   Well, I already mentioned something about this.  I said that the</P>
<P> 2    Crkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey</P>
<P> 3    Wolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was</P>
<P> 4    arrested, but I don't have any details about how the trial proceeded and</P>
<P> 5    the upshot.  I asked my legal advisors to find the complete dossier of</P>
<P> 6    that trial, but I do know for certain that he was arrested and taken to</P>
<P> 7    trial in Banja Luka, prosecuted in Banja Luka.</P>
<P> 8       Q.   The indictment against you, in the indictment you are accused of</P>
<P> 9    an act on the 7th of May, 1992, which allegedly happened there which says</P>
<P>10    that two leaders of your group under your command killed 18 males at the</P>
<P>11    agricultural farm in Crkvina.  Is that the event you are referring to?</P>
<P>12       A.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn't there</P>
<P>13    nor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical</P>
<P>14    Party.</P>
<P>15       Q.   That's all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your</P>
<P>16    answer suffices.</P>
<P>17            You are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when</P>
<P>18    allegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated</P>
<P>19    killed 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?</P>
<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating</P>
<P>21    on the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?</P>
<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was</P>
<P>23    quoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>
<P>24    So it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this</P>
<P>25    question of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43729 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    concept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he</P>
<P> 2    stands accused, because he's testifying here.</P>
<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily</P>
<P> 4    relevant for that purpose.</P>
<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I'm not going to</P>
<P> 6    insist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.</P>
<P> 7            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P> 8       Q.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993</P>
<P> 9    some members of your alleged --</P>
<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have</P>
<P>11    continued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not</P>
<P>12    see at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial</P>
<P>13    here.  I know that he's alleged to be a member of the joint criminal</P>
<P>14    enterprise.  I'm well aware of that.  But that doesn't let in any and all</P>
<P>15    kind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.</P>
<P>16            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see</P>
<P>17    here that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,</P>
<P>18    then that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren't true</P>
<P>19    either, and he has refuted a number of witnesses' statements here that I</P>
<P>20    quoted.</P>
<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know</P>
<P>22    you know that.</P>
<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.</P>
<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, witness William Thomas Francis Roy on page 28882 of</P>

<P> 1    the transcript stated here that the Muslim snipers killed three pregnant</P>
<P> 2    women and only then did the Serb snipers respond by opening fire.  Do you</P>
<P> 3    know anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked</P>
<P> 4    to killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?</P>
<P> 5       A.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire</P>
<P> 6    in Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front</P>
<P> 7    line stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part</P>
<P> 8    under Muslim control and another part under Serb control.</P>
<P> 9            Now, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind</P>
<P>10    the following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from</P>
<P>11    rifles which wasn't a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because</P>
<P>12    sniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with</P>
<P>13    optic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the</P>
<P>14    Serb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to</P>
<P>15    come by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black</P>
<P>16    market.  I don't exclude the possibility of individual cases there being</P>
<P>17    the need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was</P>
<P>18    opened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain</P>
<P>19    control of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two</P>
<P>20    sides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn't</P>
<P>21    change for many years, and one or the other side would take control of</P>
<P>22    certain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.</P>
<P>23            On the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional</P>
<P>24    killing of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims</P>
<P>25    killed about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43732 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    in Kazani and so on.</P>
<P> 2       Q.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the</P>
<P> 3    Sarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present</P>
<P> 4    on both sides.  Is that true?</P>
<P> 5       A.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in</P>
<P> 6    Sarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The</P>
<P> 7    real snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far</P>
<P> 8    more than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more</P>
<P> 9    sophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more</P>
<P>10    favourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.</P>
<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I've forgotten the evidence which I</P>
<P>12    think there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How</P>
<P>13    much personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the</P>
<P>14    conflict there.</P>
<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to</P>
<P>16    the Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that</P>
<P>17    is.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.</P>
<P>18    At Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and</P>
<P>19    I met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh</P>
<P>20    shipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my</P>
<P>21    colleagues from university and also people whom I'd been to school with,</P>
<P>22    Muslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.</P>
<P>23            JUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire</P>
<P>24    going on?</P>
<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43733 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    stay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some</P>
<P> 2    dangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you</P>
<P> 3    had to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but</P>
<P> 4    there were no more serious conflicts at that time.</P>
<P> 5            JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.</P>
<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P> 7       Q.   Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,</P>
<P> 8    referred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on</P>
<P> 9    page 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs</P>
<P>10    fired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in</P>
<P>11    Sarajevo?</P>
<P>12       A.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open</P>
<P>13    fire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be</P>
<P>14    ascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused</P>
<P>15    protected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction</P>
<P>16    from the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo</P>
<P>17    they would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at</P>
<P>18    Serb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off</P>
<P>19    in the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,</P>
<P>20    then they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at</P>
<P>21    hospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,</P>
<P>22    who were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the</P>
<P>23    hospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw</P>
<P>24    quickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived</P>
<P>25    they didn't come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43734 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    fire in retaliation.</P>
<P> 2       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited</P>
<P> 3    Bijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --</P>
<P> 4    page 8258 of Alija Gusalic's -- 18258, and I link this up with your</P>
<P> 5    indictment and Alija Gusalic's testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina</P>
<P> 6    and members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to</P>
<P> 7    takeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?</P>
<P> 8       A.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite</P>
<P> 9    correct.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just</P>
<P>10    nonsense.</P>
<P>11       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there</P>
<P>12    were Arkan's men and Seselj's men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything</P>
<P>13    about that?</P>
<P>14       A.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb</P>
<P>15    Radical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I'm absolutely certain</P>
<P>16    of that.</P>
<P>17       Q.   The same witness says on page 18260, "Seselj's men had beards and</P>
<P>18    cockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to</P>
<P>19    distribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party."</P>
<P>20       A.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb</P>
<P>21    Radical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly</P>
<P>22    clean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not</P>
<P>23    bring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot</P>
<P>24    be synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for</P>
<P>25    ideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43735 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    not a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier</P>
<P> 2    having a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not</P>
<P> 3    distribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role</P>
<P> 4    in these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.</P>
<P> 5            Members of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but</P>
<P> 6    exclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.</P>
<P> 7       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now</P>
<P> 8    I'm asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were</P>
<P> 9    not Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were</P>
<P>10    held at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you</P>
<P>11    know anything about that?</P>
<P>12       A.   I don't know about those particular localities, but I've already</P>
<P>13    talked about Mauzer's and Arkan's conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for</P>
<P>14    that reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often</P>
<P>15    attacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.</P>
<P>16       Q.   I'm sorry that I didn't draw your attention to this on time,</P>
<P>17    Mr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you</P>
<P>18    are being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in</P>
<P>19    Batkovic.</P>
<P>20       A.   I've already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb</P>
<P>21    Radical Party there.</P>
<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.</P>
<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic</P>
<P>24    testified here, and he made those assertions here, and I'm linking that up</P>
<P>25    with --</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43736 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness</P>
<P> 2    made the allegations here.</P>
<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp</P>
<P> 4    near Bijeljina.  And I've linked that up to what the indictment against</P>
<P> 5    Mr. Seselj says.</P>
<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that's not relevant.  Move on.</P>
<P> 7            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>
<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused</P>
<P> 9    Mr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a</P>
<P>10    hundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?</P>
<P>11            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.</P>
<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it's not relevant to</P>
<P>13    this case.</P>
<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the</P>
<P>15    basis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks</P>
<P>16    about Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in</P>
<P>17    Mr. Seselj's indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane</P>
<P>18    treatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in</P>
<P>19    Seselj's indictment?</P>
<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the</P>
<P>23    International Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything</P>
<P>24    about this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?</P>
<P>25       A.   I don't know anything about the visit of the International Red</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43737 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Cross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.</P>
<P> 2    Also, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of</P>
<P> 3    prisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not</P>
<P> 4    take part in any such thing.</P>
<P> 5            As for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and</P>
<P> 6    if there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would</P>
<P> 7    have to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.</P>
<P> 8       Q.   All right.  I'm not going to ask you about this anymore.  You</P>
<P> 9    mentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is</P>
<P>10    that right?</P>
<P>11       A.   Yes.</P>
<P>12       Q.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the</P>
<P>13    activity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the</P>
<P>14    situation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,</P>
<P>15    do you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?</P>
<P>16       A.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no</P>
<P>17    paramilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in</P>
<P>18    Mostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,</P>
<P>19    from the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical</P>
<P>20    Party were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them</P>
<P>21    as highly disciplined on Belgrade television.</P>
<P>22            If there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have</P>
<P>23    been members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention</P>
<P>24    platoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not</P>
<P>25    preclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43738 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    was not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.</P>
<P> 2       Q.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp</P>
<P> 3    there were Seselj's Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;</P>
<P> 4    transcript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?</P>
<P> 5       A.   That is absolutely impossible.  I've never heard of the White</P>
<P> 6    Eagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven't heard of this Buna</P>
<P> 7    camp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>
<P> 8    Party, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared</P>
<P> 9    in Buna.  I don't know anything about this, but there should be proper</P>
<P>10    records to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White</P>
<P>11    Eagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any</P>
<P>12    Red Berets.</P>
<P>13       Q.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in</P>
<P>14    Nevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?</P>
<P>15       A.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I</P>
<P>16    was in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and</P>
<P>17    in the Neretva valley.</P>
<P>18       Q.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?</P>
<P>19       A.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in</P>
<P>20    Nevesinje.</P>
<P>21       Q.   That will do.</P>
<P>22       A.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable</P>
<P>23    number of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no</P>
<P>24    conflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large</P>
<P>25    number of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43739 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    were put up at various facilities there.</P>
<P> 2       Q.   Do you know anything about a lake, Boracko Jezero, and a rest</P>
<P> 3    house there where about 19 persons were killed, according to the</P>
<P> 4    allegations made?</P>
<P> 5       A.   I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers</P>
<P> 6    of the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That's close to</P>
<P> 7    Konjic.  I've already said that there were members of the Serb guard</P>
<P> 8    there.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was</P>
<P> 9    there, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was</P>
<P>10    operating.</P>
<P>11       Q.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan's Serb</P>
<P>12    volunteer guard?</P>
<P>13       A.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.</P>
<P>14       Q.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?</P>
<P>15       A.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared</P>
<P>16    elsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities</P>
<P>17    had a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because</P>
<P>18    they stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then</P>
<P>19    they appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a</P>
<P>20    lot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic's.  As far as I</P>
<P>21    know, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.</P>
<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>
<P>23       A.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav</P>
<P>24    Lajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.</P>
<P>25       Q.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43740 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1       A.   The Serb guard.</P>
<P> 2       Q.   Of Vuk Draskovic?</P>
<P> 3       A.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from</P>
<P> 4    Novi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.</P>
<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made</P>
<P> 6    to the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.  I've forgotten</P>
<P> 7    his first name.</P>
<P> 8       A.   Jovan.</P>
<P> 9       Q.   Jovan Dulovic who testified here.  Mr. Robinson instructed me to</P>
<P>10    find the original documents that can be linked up to your submissions</P>
<P>11    since they refused to admit your submissions.</P>
<P>12            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I am sorry, Mr. Robinson.  If you're</P>
<P>13    telling me to have copies made I will do that, but I've just received</P>
<P>14    these copies.  This is a series of photocopies of articles written by</P>
<P>15    Jovan Dulovic and published in Ekspres Politika from the 16th of November,</P>
<P>16    the 26th of November, all of that in 1991.  Then the 18th of November, the</P>
<P>17    2nd of November.  So from November 1991.</P>
<P>18            In these articles, he speaks very favourably of the JNA and</P>
<P>19    commends their behaviour in the fighting around Vukovar.  For example, he</P>
<P>20    says that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats, saw the light of</P>
<P>21    the day after having stayed in cellars for many --</P>
<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, what is the question?</P>
<P>23            MR. NICE:  And, Your Honour, if I may interrupt, if there's going</P>
<P>24    to be a reference to and quotation from a newspaper article, it has to be</P>
<P>25    on the overhead projector.  It then has to be available to us to read it</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43741 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    in full should we wish to.</P>
<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's -- that's the practice, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.</P>
<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, since I have only one copy of these articles and I've</P>
<P> 6    just received that, could the usher please place them on the ELMO, and</P>
<P> 7    then you can have a look at least at some of the parts that have been</P>
<P> 8    marked.  Reference is made to Major Sljivancanin here, too, in a very</P>
<P> 9    favourable light.  Gratitude for assistance to civilians, Croats, at that,</P>
<P>10    and so on and so forth.  Please look at this series of articles.</P>
<P>11            In order to answer my question, are these at least partly articles</P>
<P>12    that you relied on when you wrote those submissions to the other side</P>
<P>13    about the untruthful testimony of Jovan Dulovic or, rather, the difference</P>
<P>14    in -- between his reporting then and his testimony here about Vukovar?</P>
<P>15            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, that was a leading but nevertheless it's</P>
<P>16    interesting to see what the articles actually say.  And if it becomes</P>
<P>17    relevant to consider their admissibility as evidence, I know the Chamber</P>
<P>18    will have in mind its open recent ruling in respect of the documents of</P>
<P>19    Jasovic and the potential evidential value or not as evidence of these</P>
<P>20    documents, but I'm most interested frankly in seeing what they actually</P>
<P>21    say.</P>
<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let's get it on the overhead projector.</P>
<P>23            There appears to be a technical problem.  We're not seeing</P>
<P>24    anything.</P>
<P>25            Mr. Milosevic, the technician is being called.  He's coming in.</P>

<P> 1    So move on to another question.  We'll come back to this.</P>
<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am sorry, but my</P>
<P> 3    next question also has to do with something that Mr. Seselj already</P>
<P> 4    testified about and the document that I obtained in the meantime and that</P>
<P> 5    would also have to be placed on the ELMO.  That is --</P>
<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,</P>
<P> 7    because the overhead projector is not working.</P>
<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further</P>
<P> 9    questions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except</P>
<P>10    for this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a</P>
<P>11    decision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were</P>
<P>12    presented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal</P>
<P>13    government said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was</P>
<P>14    known who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.</P>
<P>15    The 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.  So it is about</P>
<P>16    40 days after the coup d'etat of the 5th of October, 2000.  It was then</P>
<P>17    that they were all released, set free.</P>
<P>18            So wanted to show you this document, and I wanted to hand out</P>
<P>19    copies to you.  I've just received this.  They are all in the Serbian</P>
<P>20    language but they can be placed on the ELMO to show what the government</P>
<P>21    spokesman had said was completely disregarded, and these persons mentioned</P>
<P>22    in the criminal report against Erdemovic were set free.</P>
<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The ELMO is working now, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please take a look at this.  This is a series of</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43744 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    articles from Ekspres Politika.  Can you see the date of the newspaper?</P>
<P> 2       A.   It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of</P>
<P> 3    November.</P>
<P> 4       Q.   1991; right?</P>
<P> 5       A.   1991.</P>
<P> 6       Q.   Unless this is a leading question.</P>
<P> 7       A.   It's illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one</P>
<P> 8    of the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when</P>
<P> 9    preparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.</P>
<P>10    That is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of</P>
<P>11    Evidence and Procedure.</P>
<P>12       Q.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the</P>
<P>13    subheading?</P>
<P>14       A.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both</P>
<P>15    Serbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars</P>
<P>16    for a long time.  "Light finally," is the heading.  And then in the</P>
<P>17    subheading:  "Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas."  And then there's</P>
<P>18    another bit saying, "In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,"</P>
<P>19    and then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, "I cannot believe</P>
<P>20    that we are alive," and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated</P>
<P>21    the town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.</P>
<P>22            THE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of</P>
<P>23    the question was not heard by the interpreters.</P>
<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.  The interpreters have</P>
<P>25    indicated that you're overlapping and so she did not hear the beginning of</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43745 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    the last question.  Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P> 2            And please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.</P>
<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P> 4       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.</P>
<P> 5    Perhaps it's easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text</P>
<P> 6    is.</P>
<P> 7       A.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as</P>
<P> 8    follows:  "A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total</P>
<P> 9    of 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity."</P>
<P>10    That's what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and</P>
<P>11    Croats equally.  Civilians, that is.</P>
<P>12            I can't read the first paragraph because it's quite illegible, but</P>
<P>13    it seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,</P>
<P>14    that several ambulances were waiting to help.  "It would not be a good</P>
<P>15    thing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now."</P>
<P>16            So Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of</P>
<P>17    Vukovar before the fighting had stopped.</P>
<P>18       Q.   Can you see the subtitle which says "The cruel major"?</P>
<P>19       A.   Yes.</P>
<P>20       Q.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this</P>
<P>21    refers to and what it says about this cruel major.</P>
<P>22       A.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians</P>
<P>23    very nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that</P>
<P>24    surprised this Croat woman, and he says:  "No knows what she as a Croat</P>
<P>25    heard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers."  So he's describing the</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43746 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    behaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what</P>
<P> 2    Croatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very</P>
<P> 3    bad way.</P>
<P> 4            And then Major Sljivancanin says:  "Whenever you need anything,</P>
<P> 5    look for me and I'll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to</P>
<P> 6    go, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full</P>
<P> 7    of gratitude."  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  "He had</P>
<P> 8    followed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude."</P>
<P> 9            All this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now</P>
<P>10    Colonel Veselin Sljivancanin.</P>
<P>11       Q.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic</P>
<P>12    describes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, "Take this</P>
<P>13    child to hospital immediately."</P>
<P>14       A.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, "Take this child to the</P>
<P>15    hospital in Negoslavci right away," Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing</P>
<P>16    the ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  "Let her be given</P>
<P>17    assistance and medicine."</P>
<P>18            A little later Vlatka's mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for</P>
<P>19    her daughter in the crowd.  "Where is my child?  What have they done to</P>
<P>20    her?  Where have they taken her," Verica was crying out.</P>
<P>21            "Don't be afraid.  She is in hospital," Sljivancanin said.  The</P>
<P>22    frightened woman didn't believe it."  This is followed by Dulovic's</P>
<P>23    comment:  "Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA</P>
<P>24    soldiers."</P>
<P>25       Q.   And what does it say then?</P>

<CENTER><P><B> Page 43747 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1       A.   "Get into my car.  I'll take you to the hospital so you can see</P>
<P> 2    your child and reassure yourself that everything is all right.  They both</P>
<P> 3    entered the vehicle.  In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and</P>
<P> 4    dressed Vlatka's wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the</P>
<P> 5    daughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them."</P>
<P> 6       Q.   So this is Dulovic's report from the Vukovar war theatre.</P>
<P> 7       A.   Yes.</P>
<P> 8       Q.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on</P>
<P> 9    the following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points</P>
<P>10    are.  This large title, this heading, that is.</P>
<P>11       A.   Yes.  Now it's been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a</P>
<P>12    statement, "I believed in the army."  And what's in the subtitle.  "A</P>
<P>13    little less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in</P>
<P>14    Vukovar."  And then there's a quotation.</P>
<P>15       A.   "We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the</P>
<P>16    guards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the</P>
<P>17    hospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims."</P>
<P>18       Q.   And look what it says in the article.</P>
<P>19       A.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the</P>
<P>20    following:  "In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and</P>
<P>21    barricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house</P>
<P>22    number 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,</P>
<P>23    Milos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.  A few days</P>
<P>24    later, the members of the guards burst into the cellar.  These were</P>
<P>25    members of the Croatian National Guard Corps.  Get out or we'll throw a</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43748 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    bomb in.  The Chetniks are coming.  They're cutting everyone's throats.</P>
<P> 2    We're taking you to a shelter."</P>
<P> 3       Q.   It's quite illegible.  Could you put some light on it?</P>
<P> 4            Look at the passages marked in yellow.  You don't have to read it</P>
<P> 5    all out, just a few passages.</P>
<P> 6       A.    "Several of us -- or, rather, above us on the cemetery the guards</P>
<P> 7    members were stationed.  Milka Vidovic said, 'When they visited us in the</P>
<P> 8    cellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone's throats.  We</P>
<P> 9    Serbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the</P>
<P>10    only thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.  I</P>
<P>11    believed in our army and I believed they would arrive.'"</P>
<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  What's the question in relation to this,</P>
<P>13    Mr. Milosevic?</P>
<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>15       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what is the signature marked in yellow here?</P>
<P>16       A.   Jovan Dulovic.  The same Jovan Dulovic who four or five years</P>
<P>17    later changed his version by -- he turned around by 180 degrees because he</P>
<P>18    has become a mercenary of the Western intelligence services, and he writes</P>
<P>19    for the magazine Vreme which is the Belgrade branch of Western</P>
<P>20    intelligence agencies.</P>
<P>21       Q.   Mr. Seselj, when you glanced through this article and you dealt</P>
<P>22    with it in your submission, is there a single word here which does not</P>
<P>23    speak favourably of the JNA and the people who fought in Vukovar?</P>
<P>24       A.   No.  The texts are all exceptionally favourable, full of praise</P>
<P>25    for the soldiers and officers of the JNA during the fighting for Vukovar.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43749 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1       Q.   Would you look at the next page, please.  Let's just see what the</P>
<P> 2    date is.</P>
<P> 3       A.   The 18th, I suppose.  The 18th of November.</P>
<P> 4       Q.   Well, move on.  Move on.</P>
<P> 5       A.   Mr. Milosevic, Dulovic says here one day with volunteers and tank</P>
<P> 6    crews in the street fighting for the liberation of Vukovar.  He praises</P>
<P> 7    the volunteers who participated in the fighting for Vukovar as part of the</P>
<P> 8    JNA.  So this should be noted.</P>
<P> 9            Next page, please.  I think that it's very important to point this</P>
<P>10    out.</P>
<P>11       Q.   And the signature is Jovan Dulovic.  What's the title of this</P>
<P>12    article?</P>
<P>13       A.   The title of this article is "The Knights of Vukovar."</P>
<P>14       Q.   And who does it refer to?</P>
<P>15       A.   The units of Major Borivoje Tesic on the front line in Vukovar.</P>
<P>16    Major Borivoje Tesic I think -- says: "I think this is the last stage of</P>
<P>17    the fighting.  Crews carrying out their tasks successfully and the help of</P>
<P>18    brave people is indispensable."  It speaks of Croatian Ustasha and so on.</P>
<P>19       Q.   Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?</P>
<P>20       A.   Yes.</P>
<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic</P>
<P>22    said volunteers as part of JNA.  Could you show us the passage where</P>
<P>23    Mr. Dulovic said so?</P>
<P>24            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He says here:  "One day with</P>
<P>25    volunteers and tank crews in the street fighting for the liberation of</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43750 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Vukovar."  This is above the headline.</P>
<P> 2            Then he goes on to say:  "Speaking favourably of Stanko Vujanovic,</P>
<P> 3    he says the commander of the 1st Company of the Territorial Defence of</P>
<P> 4    Vukovar who is said to be a man who knows no fear." It's quite difficult</P>
<P> 5    to read this.  My eyesight is not so good and this is not very legible.</P>
<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P> 7       Q.   Can it be enlarged?</P>
<P> 8       A.   "With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making</P>
<P> 9    openings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze</P>
<P>10    through and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.  The house in</P>
<P>11    which they stopped in Prugomijska [phoen] Street near the Brdo cafe is</P>
<P>12    under constant fire by snipers whose positionings are very difficult to</P>
<P>13    discern."</P>
<P>14            JUDGE KWON:  Now, Mr. Seselj, I would like see to see the passage</P>
<P>15    which shows that they were part of JNA as you indicated.  Or was it your</P>
<P>16    comment?</P>
<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  Please.  In the entire text the</P>
<P>18    volunteers are spoken of as members of the JNA.  We have passage here in</P>
<P>19    the third column where it says it's in the late afternoon and the fighting</P>
<P>20    is dying down.  The volunteers --</P>
<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Could you use the pointer.  And you indicate on the</P>
<P>22    newspaper on the ELMO, not your monitor.  Yes.</P>
<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] "It's late in the afternoon and the</P>
<P>24    fighting is dying down.  The volunteers have pierced deep, and they have</P>
<P>25    conquered territory between the enemy forces.  The fighters will stay here</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43751 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    until the morning.  There were no casualties today except for one soldier</P>
<P> 2    who was killed, and his name was Vignjevic."</P>
<P> 3            He then says:  "We are going back while shells are flying over our</P>
<P> 4    heads and Howitzer shells and so on."</P>
<P> 5            This whole text implies that the volunteers why part of the JNA.</P>
<P> 6    Mr. Kwon, you have here an order showing that these volunteers joined the</P>
<P> 7    1st Guards Brigade.  The order was delivered to the OTP from Belgrade and</P>
<P> 8    it's beyond dispute.</P>
<P> 9            In the Vukovar, there were no troops outside the JNA.  There were</P>
<P>10    no paramilitary units.</P>
<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  It is your comment.  I really didn't see any</P>
<P>12    concrete -- the description these volunteers as part of JNA by</P>
<P>13    Mr. Dulovic.</P>
<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have to read the whole text and</P>
<P>15    everything will become clear to you.</P>
<P>16            JUDGE KWON:  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>
<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>
<P>18       Q.   Look at the next page, please.  The following text or this one</P>
<P>19    again says the Knights of Vukovar, Major Borivoje Tesic's units on the</P>
<P>20    front line, and this is a large article which seems not to be by Dulovic,</P>
<P>21    but on the left-hand side there is a small one:  "Brave commander falls,</P>
<P>22    Borovo Selo."  Would you look at the signature?  I believe it's by</P>
<P>23    Dulovic.  Could you scroll up?</P>
<P>24       A.   Yes.</P>
<P>25       Q.   What does it say in the passage marked by yellow?</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43752 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1       A.   The initials "JD" mean Jovan Dulovic.</P>
<P> 2       Q.   And what does it say in this last passage?</P>
<P> 3       A.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- "The inhabitants of the</P>
<P> 4    Crepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,</P>
<P> 5    who with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village</P>
<P> 6    and one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the</P>
<P> 7    highest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages."</P>
<P> 8       Q.   And he was killed?</P>
<P> 9       A.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives</P>
<P>10    him.  Next page.</P>
<P>11       Q.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a</P>
<P>12    look?  I haven't had time to look at it all carefully.</P>
<P>13       A.   Yes.  There's a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of</P>
<P>14    November.  "Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate</P>
<P>15    Vukovar."</P>
<P>16            In these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate</P>
<P>17    Vukovar, and five years later he's saying something completely different.</P>
<P>18             "Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in</P>
<P>19    Vukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb."  And then it</P>
<P>20    says:  "The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back," and so on</P>
<P>21    and so forth.</P>
<P>22            So this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the</P>
<P>23    JNA.</P>
<P>24       Q.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It's been circled.</P>
<P>25       A.   Yes.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43753 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1       Q.   Very well.</P>
<P> 2       A.   The 4th of November, 1991.  "For two days fierce fighting has not</P>
<P> 3    stopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in</P>
<P> 4    flames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of</P>
<P> 5    Njusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the</P>
<P> 6    Territorial Defence.  Advances by Territorial Defence units and volunteers</P>
<P> 7    from the direction of Trpinja stopped on the edge of Borovo Naselje."</P>
<P> 8            He then speaks of a Croatian mortar attack on Bobota [phoen] and</P>
<P> 9    so on.</P>
<P>10       Q.   Is this another report by Dulovic?</P>
<P>11       A.   Yes, it's signed by Jovan Dulovic.</P>
<P>12       Q.   Is there anything else, any other report?</P>
<P>13       A.   I'm looking at another text here but I can't see whether it's by</P>
<P>14    Dulovic or not because it's not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian</P>
<P>15    volunteer guard but again a very favourable text.  I couldn't see -- I</P>
<P>16    can't see the name of the author here.  I can't see it on this page.</P>
<P>17       Q.   Is there anything else underneath, another report?</P>
<P>18       A.   "Who are the volunteers," is the next title.</P>
<P>19       Q.   Well, I can't see anything anymore.</P>
<P>20       A.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced</P>
<P>21    through the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is "Through the holes</P>
<P>22    to the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?</P>
<P>23    Unknown ammunition with inhumane bullets."</P>
<P>24            What happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used</P>
<P>25    weapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43754 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    because the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal</P>
<P> 2    organs.</P>
<P> 3       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I can't see what it says here in yellow, highlighted</P>
<P> 4    in yellow.</P>
<P> 5       A.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It's Major Radic now</P>
<P> 6    who also stands accused in The Hague.  "Throughout the month of October,</P>
<P> 7    the fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in</P>
<P> 8    the clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least</P>
<P> 9    one person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja</P>
<P>10    [phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in</P>
<P>11    that way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had</P>
<P>12    taken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.</P>
<P>13    The snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own</P>
<P>14    control and then a solution was found to move through the houses."</P>
<P>15       Q.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic's article</P>
<P>16    again?</P>
<P>17       A.   Well, it's not legible but it is a series of articles by him.  We</P>
<P>18    can't find a signature here but quite obviously it is a series of articles</P>
<P>19    by him.</P>
<P>20       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  Is that a series of articles to which you</P>
<P>21    referred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect</P>
<P>22    to Dulovic's testimony?</P>
<P>23       A.   Yes.  But this isn't the complete material.  My legal advisors</P>
<P>24    found many more texts of this kind and they quote them in extenso, and in</P>
<P>25    my submission I state my intention to disclose them in keeping with</P>

<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><B> Page 43755 </B></P></CENTER>
<P> 1    Rule 67 of the rules of evidence.</P>
<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, I have one more question</P>
<P> 3    [as interpreted] -- Robinson, I have a question for you.  As my associates</P>
<P> 4    have managed to come by a set of these or at least photocopies of the</P>
<P> 5    papers from 1991 which Mr. Seselj refers to in his submission to the other</P>
<P> 6    side, the presentation of these photocopies, is that sufficient grounds</P>
<P> 7    for my request that they be accepted as exhibits, that Mr. Seselj's</P>
<P> 8    submission be accepted as an exhibit?</P>
<P> 9            MR. NICE:  Rather interesting issues, I think, arise on the</P>
<P>10    validity of these documents as exhibits, and it may be necessary to go</P>
<P>11    back and remind ourselves of what Mr. Dulovic himself said about these</P>
<P>12    matters.  So I would respectfully invite the Chamber to put that matter</P>
<P>13    back.  But may we see the -- may we have access to this material tonight</P>
<P>14    in copy form in any event?  It may be we have them elsewhere, but it will</P>
<P>15    be a difficult task to find them and it may in any event not be an</P>
<P>16    identical collection.  I simply don't know.</P>
<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, we'll have to consider the</P>
<P>18    application that you're making.  In the meantime, make -- have copies</P>
<P>19    available to the Prosecution and to the assigned counsel and to the</P>
<P>20    Chamber.</P>
<P>21            We'll have to adjourn now.  It's 7.00.  We will resume tomorrow at</P>
<P>22    9.00 a.m.</P>
<P>23                          --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at 7.04 p.m.,</P>
<P>24                          to be reconvened on Tuesday, the 6th day</P>
<P>25                          of September, 2005, at 9.00 a.m. </P>
