You are still under\r\noath, the oath that you took yesterday. You may be seated.  Thank you.\r\nMISS HOLLIS:  Perhaps we could turn off one of those microphones and, Mrs.\r\nRamic, if you could sit back a bit from the microphone?  Thank you.\r\nMrs. Ramic, when we finished yesterday you had indicated that after\r\nthe events that occurred in the military barracks you a few days later\r\nwent to your village to visit your brother and after some time you\r\ncame back again to your home in Prijedor.  Do you recall your home\r\nbeing searched after your return to Prijedor?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Did you recognise any of the people who searched your home?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Who did you recognise?\r\nA.  Milorad Kicanovic.\r\nQ.  How did you know Milorad Kicanovic?\r\nA.  Because we had worked together in the Auto Transport Company.\r\nQ.  What was his ethnic group?\r\nA.  Serbian.\r\nQ.  Did he explain to you why your home was being searched?\r\nA.  No, he said nothing.  He only said, \"I need to search your home\".\r\nQ.  Was anything taken from your home?\r\nA.  No, he just threw things around, took everything from the wardrobe,\r\nsearched everything and then left.\r\nQ.  What happened after this search?\r\nA.  Since I was standing in the corridor on his way out from the bedroom,\r\nhe knocked me down and raped me in the corridor.\r\nQ.  Did he threaten you in any way after the rape?\r\nA.  Yes, if I told about this to anybody he would come back and kill me.\r\nQ.  The day after this search were you again taken to the police\r\ndepartment?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Who took you there?\r\nA.  Strika.\r\nQ.  How did you know Strika?\r\nA.  Because he had been on duty at the bus station and travelled with me\r\nwhen we went from Dubica.  Sometimes he got on the bus sometimes in\r\nDonji Milanovac sometimes in Gornji.  That is how we knew him as a\r\npoliceman.\r\nQ.  What was his ethnic group?\r\nA.  Serbian.\r\nQ.  How were you transported to the police station?\r\nA.  In a green Mercedes.\r\nQ.  Did he say anything to you on that trip to the police station?\r\nA.  He cursed me and mentioned the derogatory names and we should all be\r\nkilled since we do not want to be  controlled by Serbian authority.\r\nQ.  When you were at the police department did you see any Muslims there\r\nthat you knew?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Who was that?\r\nA.  Faruk Rizvic and his workman, Osman.\r\nQ.  What was their condition when you saw them at the police station?\r\nA.  They were in a bad condition.  They were covered with blood.  Their\r\nclothes were torn.\r\nQ.

His workman, Osman.\r\nQ.  You said this man's name is Faruk or Farud?\r\nA.  Faruk Rizvic.\r\nQ.  Thank you.  After you saw Faruk were you taken to a room at the police\r\nstation?\r\nA.  Yes, they took us to a room called \"buhara\".\r\nQ.  What was the condition of this room to which you were taken?\r\nA.  It was all covered with blood.\r\nQ.  What happened to you in this room?\r\nA.  Zeljko Boronja who had worked in Kripo came in with two soldiers in\r\ncamouflage uniforms and with masks on their faces.  You could not see\r\nwho they were and then I was raped again.\r\nQ.  When you were raped were you also beaten?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Mrs. Ramic, at this time after the things that had occurred to you\r\nover the last few days, what was your emotional and mental state?\r\nA.  Horrible, very, very bad.\r\nQ.  After this last rape at the police station were you taken to Keraterm\r\nfrom there?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Who took you there?\r\nA.  Strika.\r\nQ.  Do you recall how long you were held at Keraterm?\r\nA.  I cannot remember.  I know when they brought me to the guard house at\r\nthe entrance they took me to the gate where I saw about 2,000 people\r\nin two rooms.\r\nQ.  While you were being held at Keraterm, did you see any of the\r\ndetainees that you recognised?\r\nA.  At the first door, in the first room, I saw Faruk Rizvic, his workman\r\nOsman, Feho Ramic, Halid Nezirovic and a lot of other people I knew\r\nbecause I cannot remember, but most of them were known to me.  In the\r\nsecond room, when I saw my brother, Suad Ramic, and my nephew, Fadil\r\nSoftic, and (indecipherable), then I was sick.\r\nQ.  What was the condition of these people that you saw there?\r\nA.  They had -- they were all beaten up, exhausted, covered with blood.\r\nTheir clothes were torn.\r\nQ.  Mrs. Ramic, while you were held at Keraterm did you see any detainees\r\nthere who were beaten or injured?\r\nA.  Yes, a guard who was a stranger came and took me to  the guard house\r\nand 10 minutes after that, I cannot quite remember how many, Zigic,\r\nthe taxi driver, Zoran Zigic, followed by someone who called him\r\nNedeljko, was called Nedeljko, they brought me to the area behind the\r\nguard house.  I could not recognise who was who and what they looked\r\nlike.  When they knocked me down and when Zigic took out the knife and\r\nstarted to stab people, I started vomiting and I lost consciousness\r\nand I do not know anything what happened after that.\r\nQ.

So you were in the big room where the food was served?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Did you know any of the camp personnel, had you known them before you\r\ncame to Omarska camp?\r\nA.  I did know some of them, but others I did not, but I did know most of\r\nthem.\r\nQ.  Who are the ones that you knew?\r\nA.

While you were at the camp were you ever required to perform work\r\nduties?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What type of duties were you required to perform?\r\nA.  I had to clean the toilets, the rooms upstairs, or go to the\r\nseparation.\r\nQ.  Did you perform any duties in the restaurant area itself?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What did you do there?\r\nA.  We washed the dishes and handed out the meals.\r\nQ.  When you would clean the rooms did that include rooms on the first\r\nfloor?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Did you ever find anything unusual as far as objects  in those rooms?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What did you find?\r\nA.  We used to find batons, a piece of cable, copper wires pushed through\r\nhose, pieces of wood, iron rods, square iron rods, aluminium pieces,\r\nand then there was led on top.  It was all bloody.  We had to clean\r\nthat and hand it over to the Commander's office.\r\nQ.  What was the condition of those rooms when you cleaned them?\r\nA.  They were bloody.  We used to find teeth, hair, pieces of human flesh,\r\nclothes, shoes.\r\nQ.  While you were in the camp at Omarska, did you ever see corpses there?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  How often would you see them?\r\nA.  Almost every day.\r\nQ.  Where would you see them?\r\nA.  Between the big workshop where men were held, where they came out of\r\nto go to lunch, and in the area between that building and the hedge.\r\nQ.  Did you ever see what was done with those bodies?\r\nA.  They used to come with a small lorry, a yellow lorry, which had a long\r\nbody, and they would take the dead bodies in the direction behind the\r\nwhite house.\r\nJUDGE STEPHEN:  Can I ask you to enquire about the hedge?  We have not\r\nheard of the hedge before.\r\nMISS HOLLIS:  Yes, your Honour.  (To the witness):  You mentioned a hedge.\r\nWhere was this hedge located?\r\nA.  The hedge was to the left of the white house.  There  was a lawn there\r\nand the hedge was -- and the dead bodies were placed in front of that\r\nhedge.\r\nQ.  If I could ask you, please, what I am going to ask you to do will be\r\nto leave where you are sitting, come around to the model and for the\r\nCourt point out where this hedge was located near the white house.  If\r\nyou could do that now, please?  You can take off your headphones and\r\njust come around and point to where it was.\r\nA.  (The witness indicated on the model).\r\nQ.  How far -- if you could put on the headphones -- along there did that\r\nhedge run?\r\nA.  It was a long one, but we did not pay much attention, but this is\r\nwhere the hedge was and this is where the dead bodies were.\r\nQ.  So did the hedge run parallel to the white house and the small red\r\nbuilding?  Point in the direction in which the hedge was growing.   Is\r\nit long-wise?\r\nA.  It was a long hedge.\r\nQ.  It ran from that location you pointed how far toward the white house?\r\nA.  It did not go towards the white house.  The hedge was on this side.\r\nQ.  All right.\r\nA.  So, we could go around the white house.\r\nQ.  So the hedge was closer to that small red building?\r\nA.  Yes, yes it was closer to the red building.\r\nQ.  Thank you very much.  If you could resume your seat? To your\r\nknowledge, this yellow truck that you talked about, was this truck\r\nused for anything else?\r\nA.  They brought food in on it.\r\nQ.  Do you recall an occasion when you saw bodies taken away in a larger\r\ntruck?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What do you recall about that occasion?\r\nA.  When a guard came to pick us up to take us down there, we came to the\r\nglass on the way out of the staircase, suddenly they returned us, they\r\ntook us back.\r\nQ.  What had you seen before they took you back?\r\nA.  We had seen the yellow lorry and machine for loading.\r\nQ.  How big was this truck that you saw on this occasion?\r\nA.  It was big, bigger than the yellow lorry I referred to earlier on.\r\nQ.  Had you seen similar trucks like that?\r\nA.  Please repeat, I did not understand the question.\r\nQ.  Yes.  Prior to seeing this truck, had you seen trucks that were\r\nsimilar to this one?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What type of trucks were these?\r\nA.  They were similar to the Mann, Fap which is a Yugoslav factory or TAM\r\nwhich is a Slovenia factory of lorries.\r\nQ.  Do you know what those types of trucks were used for?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What were they used for?\r\nA.  They used them for public transportation, for the transportation of\r\ngravel, wood, etc.\r\nQ.  Had you heard any sounds or unusual activity the night before you saw\r\nthis truck?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What had you heard?\r\nA.  We had heard moans, screams and the noise, the noise of something like\r\na fence being broken.\r\nQ.  What do you mean \"something like a fence being broken\"?  What kind of\r\nnoise is that?\r\nA.  As if you were breaking something.\r\nQ.  Later that morning, after you had been told to go back to your room,\r\nwere you brought down to the restaurant area?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Did you see any unusual activity at the white house that day?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What did you see?\r\nA.  We saw men being taken out of the white house and then, using a hose,\r\nforced them to strip, beat them on the pista, there were people facing\r\nthe wall.\r\nQ.  While you were held at Omarska were other women held there with you?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Do you have any idea of the number of women who were held there?\r\nA.  36 Muslim women and two Serbian women and two Croat women -- three\r\nCroat, three Catholic women.\r\nQ.  While you were there at Omarska do you recall an occasion when two\r\nwomen named Edna Dautovic and Sadeta Medunjanin were taken from the\r\ncamp?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What do you remember about that occasion?\r\nA.  I remember clearly because that day on 20th a guard  had a birthday,\r\nhe said.  On 20th July at half past 10 they came and took away Sadeta.\r\nQ.  Did you see where they were taken when they were taken from the\r\nrestaurant building?\r\nA.  We rushed out, a couple of us, we went to the place where there was a\r\nbath tub and a toilet and, of course, when we saw we were shocked\r\nbecause we were expecting that to happen to us every day.\r\nQ.  What did you see when you looked out of that window?\r\nA.  Out of the window I saw Zeljko Meagic and Mirko.\r\nQ.  Who was Mirko?\r\nA.  I cannot remember his surname.  He had a beard. Babic, yes, Babic was\r\nhis surname.  Then we saw the bus with people being taken to it and it\r\nsaid, \"Unatrans Bihac\" on the bus and then it said, \"Private business,\r\nowner Seselj\".\r\nQ.  You saw people being put on that bus?\r\nA.  Yes, when I saw that we were all frightened, but since Tidza had\r\nremained behind, because her brother had been called out, she remained\r\nwith us and watched that incident.\r\nQ.  Then the people were loaded on the bus.  Did you recognise any of the\r\npeople loaded on the bus?\r\nA.  No.\r\nQ.  Did you ever actually see Sadeta or Edna being put on the bus?\r\nA.  Yes, when they took them away, they said they would be exchanged in\r\nBihac.  As soon as they got on the bus, we went back to our room and\r\nTidza remained behind and then heard her brother's name being called.\r\nQ.  Without mentioning the names of any women, I would ask you if during\r\nthe time you were at Omarska, during the night, any women were called\r\nout of the room?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  How often would this happen?\r\nA.  Every night.\r\nQ.  Who would call the women out?\r\nA.  Mladjo, Drago Prcac, Zeljko Meagic, Nedelkjo Grabovac or Pop, fat,\r\nheavily built with a moustache.\r\nQ.  Again without mentioning the names, did any of the women who were\r\ncalled out ever tell you what had happened to them?\r\nA.  No, we never told each other what happened.\r\nQ.  Were you yourself called out of the room at night?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  How often did this happen to you?\r\nA.  Five times.\r\nQ.  Who was it who called you out?\r\nA.  Mladjo, Mladen Radic.\r\nQ.  This is the man you also referred to as \"Krkan\"?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  When this man would called you out of the room where would he take\r\nyou?\r\nA.  He would take me downstairs to the first room next to the staircase on\r\nthe way to the kitchen.\r\nQ.  When he took you down there to this room what did he do to you?\r\nA.  Raped me.\r\nQ.  Were you beaten by him as well as raped by him?\r\nA.  Once only as I was going out.\r\nQ.  Did you ever see any of the other camp guards or personnel when you\r\nwere being taken to that room or back from that room?\r\nA.  Yes, Zeljko Meagic while I was coming out.\r\nQ.  What happened when you saw Zeljko Meagic?\r\nA.  He only slapped me in the face and said, \"You, whore, scram to your\r\nroom\".\r\nQ.  As a result of the treatment to you in the camp at Omarska and what\r\nhad happened to you previously, did you eventually come to a point\r\nwhere you contemplated trying to find a way to commit suicide?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Did someone talk to you about that?\r\nA.  Biba and Zlata, they did, and they were crying, \"No, please do not; we\r\nshall survive, we shall live, to tell the truth\".\r\nQ.  As a result of the rapes that were done to you, did you have\r\ncontinuing medical problems after you left the camp and after you left\r\nBosnia?\r\nA.  Yes, yes.\r\nQ.  Did those medical problems eventually result in your having surgery to\r\nremove your uterus?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  After you left the Omarska camp where were you taken?\r\nA.  To Prijedor -- sorry, to Trnopolje.\r\nQ.  From Trnopolje you went back to Prijedor?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  How long did you remain in Prijedor?\r\nA.  Until January 13th '93.\r\nQ.  What were the conditions like for you in Prijedor  during that time?\r\nA.  Bad.  We could not go out.  We could not buy anything.  If you went\r\nout, somebody beat you because many people knew you, so they would\r\ntake you to the MUP and give you beating, and that was that.\r\nQ.  How were you able to leave Prijedor?\r\nA.  I still wonder, is it possible that I am still alive?\r\nQ.  Did you have to pay someone to get you out of Prijedor?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Do you recall how much you had to pay?\r\nA.  I cannot recall that and I would not say that.  The important thing is\r\nthat life was dear.\r\nQ.  When did you last see your husband?\r\nA.  Some 10 days before I was taken to the camp.\r\nQ.  Have you heard anything from him?\r\nA.  I know nothing.  I only know that we saw each other that day.\r\nQ.  Have you made attempts to find him?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Have you had any success at all in determining what happened to him?\r\nA.  No, we did not learn anything.\r\nMISS HOLLIS:  No further questions.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Cross-examination?\r\nMR. KAY:  No cross-examination, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Is there any objection to Mrs. Ramic being\r\npermanently excused?\r\nMR. KAY:  No, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mrs. Ramic, you are free to go. You are free to\r\nleave.  Thank you very much for coming.\r\nTHE WITNESS:  Thank you.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  You may leave now.  The usher will help you.\r\n(The witness withdrew)\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Miss Hollis, will you call the next witness?  Mr.\r\nNiemann, we have a selection today.\r\nMISS HOLLIS:  Your Honour, we have two motions at this time we would like\r\nto be heard.  They involve matters that are coming up.  We will need\r\nto do those in closed session.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  How long do you anticipate it will take to consider\r\nthose motions?\r\nMISS HOLLIS:  It should be fairly quickly, your Honour. They deal with\r\nissues regarding witnesses.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  OK.  We will stand in recess for approximately 10\r\nminutes, the time required to convert this to a closed session.  Is\r\nthere any objection from the Defence?\r\nMR. WLADIMIROFF:  No, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  OK.  We will stand in recess for 10 minutes and then\r\nwe will return in closed session.\r\n(Closed session)\r\npage 3771 redacted –closed session\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Tieger, would you call your next witness,\r\nplease?\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Thank you, your Honour.  The next witness is Emir Beganovic.\r\nEMIR BEGANOVIC, called.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Sir, would you please take the oath that is being\r\ngiven to you?  Read that oath and take it.\r\nTHE WITNESS [In translation]:  I solemnly declare that I will speak the\r\ntruth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\r\n(The witness was sworn)\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you.  You may be seated.\r\nExamined by MR. TIEGER\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Tieger?\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Sir, what is your name?\r\nA.  Emir Beganovic.\r\nQ.  What is your age?\r\nA.  I am 41.\r\nQ.  Where were you born?\r\nA.  Prijedor.\r\nQ.  What is your nationality?\r\nA.  Muslim.\r\nQ.  What was your occupation before the conflict in 1992?\r\nA.  I had private restaurant business and together with my wife I had\r\nflorist shop.\r\nQ.  How many restaurants or cafes did you own?\r\nA.  Three, and the fourth one was the florist shop.\r\nQ.  Where were your businesses located?\r\nA.  Two of them on the Esada Midzica Street, the third  restaurant was on\r\nMarsala Tita Street.\r\nQ.  Is it correct to say that you were well known locally as a successful\r\nbusinessman in Prijedor?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  In what part of Prijedor did you live?\r\nA.  Until 1990 I lived in the old town, in Stari Grad, until I built\r\nmyself a flat in Salamica Street and I moved then there.\r\nQ.  After the elections of 1990 and before the outbreak of the actual\r\nconflict in 1992, did increasing tensions develop between Serbs and\r\nMuslims in the Prijedor area?\r\nA.  Yes, it was growing after the elections, after the party election the\r\ntensions began to grow, but it was not as strongly felt as when the\r\nconflict in Croatia broke out.  When that conflict broke out, then the\r\ntensions began to mount.\r\nQ.  Before that time had people in Prijedor tended to distinguish between\r\nwho was Muslim and who was Serb?\r\nA.  Well, by physical appearance one could not distinguish between them,\r\nonly if we knew each other, if we knew who was a Muslim, who was a\r\nCroat, who was a Serb, but there was no difference whatsoever.\r\nQ.  Did you have Serb friends as well as Muslim friends?\r\nA.  Well, at the present time after this war when I look back, I find that\r\nI had more friends among the Serbs than among the Muslims, I mean,\r\nfamily friends.\r\nQ.  As the tensions you spoke of increased before the outbreak of the\r\nconflict, did you become involved with a group in Prijedor town that\r\nwas interested in promoting peace?\r\nA.  Yes, I joined the League for Peace, and I was on its steering\r\ncommittee.\r\nQ.  Did the establishment of the League for Peace result from any\r\nparticular incident or was it a response to the general situation?\r\nA.  Well, it was spontaneous.  I aspired to having all options open in\r\nPrijedor just to avoid war, and we thought that regardless of what\r\nParty who had voted for ought to join us, and simply show the\r\nleadership of the first and the second and third Party that the people\r\nwas not for war -- that people were not for war.\r\nQ.  Approximately when was the League established?\r\nA.  The League was established in '91, sometime towards the end of '91, I\r\ncannot remember the month exactly. I believe it was November.\r\nQ.  Who was the primary organiser of the League?\r\nA.  Primary organiser was Dr. Esad Sadikovic, called \"Eso\".\r\nQ.  Was Dr. Sadikovic a medical doctor who had previously worked with the\r\nUnited Nations?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Were there persons of all nationalities on the steering committee?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Did the League for Peace have any connection with any political group\r\nor any other peace group?\r\nA.  No.\r\nQ.  The purpose of the group was to unite people in Prijedor in the hope\r\nof avoiding any inter-ethnic conflicts or tensions?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What steps did the League for Peace take in this effort to promote\r\ninter-ethnic harmony?\r\nA.  Well, we mostly organised concerts in public, public concerts in the\r\ncentre  of the town.  We tried to organise concerts in the beginning\r\nwhile we still could get permission from the local SUP.  We had our\r\nmeetings in public.  Anybody was admitted, whoever wanted to come.\r\nBut later on things began to be more complex.  The SUP refused to give\r\nus permission to organise concerts, and they stopped permitting us to\r\nrent out a hall for our meetings.  It just dwindled and gradually\r\nfaded out spontaneously because it had no possibilities of continuing\r\nits activity.\r\nQ.  During that period in which the League was able to obtain permission\r\nto hold concerts, how many people attended those concerts?\r\nA.  Well, there was never a concert attended by less than 7,000 or 8,000\r\nor 10,000 people even.\r\nQ.  Were there speeches or messages of peace during the concerts?\r\nA.  Yes, yes.  All the addresses, all the speeches were serving the\r\npurpose of peace.  There were no speeches actually, there were\r\npolitical messages.\r\nQ.  I am sorry, the translation says \"there were political messages\".\r\nWhat kind of messages were delivered during the concerts the League\r\nfor Peace conducted?\r\nA.  Well, no, not political messages, messages for peace, peace messages.\r\nQ.  Eventually the League for Peace disbanded because of obstruction from\r\nthe authorities?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Approximately when did the League for Peace conclude its efforts?\r\nA.  I should say towards the end of February.\r\nQ.  Was that at a time of increasing tensions?\r\nA.  The tensions were increasing from one day to another at that time,\r\nyes.\r\nQ.  Did you send your family out of the area for safety?\r\nA.  Yes, I sent them to their relatives in Croatia, in Istria.\r\nQ.  When did your family leave the area?\r\nA.  I think they left on 12th March '92.\r\nQ.  You remained in Prijedor?\r\nA.  Yes, I remained in Prijedor, and a few days later I moved to Dr. Esad\r\nSadikovic's house.\r\nQ.  Were you concerned about what might happen in Prijedor?\r\nA.  I was concerned.  That was why I had moved my family away, but I could\r\nnever dream that anything even remotely like what did happen could\r\nhappen.\r\nQ.  Were you in Prijedor when the Serbs took power in a takeover on April\r\n30th?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  After the takeover did tensions mount?\r\nA.  Well, hour after hour the tension mounted with every hour, ever since\r\nthe moment they took over the power on 29th April.\r\nQ.  Were you at Dr. Sadikovic's house when the cleansing  of Prijedor town\r\nbegan on May 30th?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  From the windows of Dr. Sadikovic's house or from his terrace, were\r\nyou able to see what was happening in Prijedor and, in particular, in\r\nStari Grad?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What were you able to see?\r\nA.  I could see that Stari Grad was ablaze literally. I could even\r\nidentify the position of my parent's house. I could see it on fire.\r\nLiterally the whole of Stari Grad was aflame.\r\nQ.  Did you see soldiers?\r\nA.  I saw them.\r\nQ.  How were they dressed?\r\nA.  Different kinds of uniforms, of different colours.\r\nQ.  Were those Serbian forces?\r\nA.  Well, I guess they were.\r\nQ.  Did you hear announcements over the radio about what Muslims should\r\ndo?\r\nA.  Yes, we had the radio on and we listened, the warnings and\r\ninstructions how people should behave.\r\nQ.  What did the radio messages instruct Muslims to do?\r\nA.  Well, in the beginning they said we should merely stay partly in our\r\nhouses, that nothing would happen. Then a little bit later on, perhaps\r\nafter an hour or so, they said that all Muslims should put out white\r\nflags on their houses and if they did not have any flags, then perhaps\r\nbed linen, sheets or whatever.\r\nQ.  Did you do so?\r\nA.  Yes, we put out bed sheets on both sides of the  house.\r\nQ.  You say \"we put out bed sheets\", who was in Dr. Sadikovic's house with\r\nyou?\r\nA.  That morning there was my friend, Asif Kapetanovic.\r\nQ.  Then at some point after you and Mr. Kapetanovic had hung the white\r\nsheets in response to the instructions on the radio, did he observe\r\nsomething that caused him great concern?\r\nA.  Yes, at a certain point he went to the terrace on the upper floor and\r\nsaw that his business premises were on fire.  It was a one-storeyed\r\nhouse on the ground floor, they had their business.  On the upper\r\nfloor they had a flat.  I heard him scream.  I asked him what was it\r\nand he said that his mother was in that flat upstairs, and that the\r\nflat was on fire, and I ran out.  I could see the flames, perhaps as\r\nmuch as 20 metres high.  The house was ablaze.  It was literally all\r\nburning.\r\nPerhaps it took him some time to calm down, and he decided then to\r\ngo and see what had happened to his mother.  At that point I did not\r\nknow what to do.  So I decided to go with him.  I could not really\r\nleave him to himself, because for the past few days he was suffering\r\nfrom kidneys and that was why he was in Eso's house, to treat his\r\nkidneys, and he could not, of course, go to the hospital because the\r\nhospital had already been taken over by the Serbs.\r\nQ.  While you were outside were you confronted at some point by a Serb\r\nsoldier and did you flee that soldier and run into the nearest Muslim\r\nhouse?\r\nA.  Yes.  The soldier came up and said, \"Halt\".  We were  some 50 metres\r\naway and I automatically said, \"Asif, I am not going to wait for him,\r\nI am fleeing\", and there was the wire of the house nearby -- there was\r\na hedge of the house nearby and I jumped over that hedge, and then I\r\nheard three or four bursts of fire, but I was in the luck, I was not\r\nhit.\r\nThen I crawled behind that house to another house. I used to know\r\npeople who lived around there.  I knew it was a Muslim house.  I\r\nknocked on the door and was flabbergasted when I saw another friend of\r\nmine, Saim Mesanovic who opened the door for me and let me in even\r\nthough he was from a different part of the town, and that was his\r\nrelative's house.\r\nQ.  While you were in that house was there another announcement on the\r\nradio that Muslims should put white ribbons or arm bands on their\r\narms, form columns and go to the main square?\r\nA.  Yes, they said that all Muslims from that part of the town should come\r\nout and head for the town with white arm bands.\r\nQ.  Did you and the other persons in the house do that?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Once outside were you directed by Serb forces toward the area of the\r\ntaller buildings in the town centre?\r\nA.  Yes, they directed us in the direction of the small marketplace.  Then\r\nby Muharem Rujanovic Street, there were three skyscrapers in Prijedor\r\nand that is where they stopped, they directed us.  There was a column\r\nof perhaps 1,000 to 2,000 people.  I would not know exactly.\r\nQ.  On the way did you see any corpses?\r\nA.  Yes, in the marketplace I went round a pile in which there were some\r\nfour or five bodies, and then I happened to glance over the area of\r\nthe marketplace and I saw another body lying there, and then I could\r\nnot stand it any longer and I turned my head away.\r\nQ.  Were those bodies of civilians?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  When you reached the area they directed you to, were there buses\r\nwaiting?\r\nA.  Well, the buses were already there, parked.\r\nQ.  Did Serb forces then begin to separate the men from women and\r\nchildren?\r\nA.  Yes, they said that men over the age of 15 should stand, should move\r\nto one side, and children below the age of 15 and women should go to\r\nthe other side.\r\nQ.  Did you board one of those buses?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Where were you first taken?\r\nA.  Well, first they took us to the SUP and that is where the buses\r\nstopped, by the SUP.\r\nQ.  So first to the police station in Prijedor town?\r\nA.  To the police station in Prijedor.\r\nQ.  How long did the bus remain there?\r\nA.  Not long, some 10 minutes or so, five or 10 minutes.\r\nQ.  Were there guards on your bus?\r\nA.  Yes, there were two or three perhaps.  I remember that one had got off\r\nand entered the SUP building, probably to get instructions, and\r\nreturned after a couple of minutes, and the bus continued.\r\nQ.  I have been referring to your bus.  Were there other  buses loaded\r\nwith men and boys over the age of 15 along with your bus at the SUP?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  After the relatively brief period of time at the Prijedor SUP, where\r\nwere you taken?\r\nA.  We were taken by JNA street.  We came out of the JNA street to the\r\ntennis grounds, to Partizanska and then on towards Tomasica.\r\nQ.  After that where did the buses go?\r\nA.  Before Tomasica they turned.  I had never used that road before.\r\nLater on I learned that it was the road to Omarska.\r\nQ.  Is that where your bus was taken, to Omarska?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  We will stand in recess for 20 minutes.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Tieger, would you begin?\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Thank you, your Honour.  (To the witness): Mr. Beganovic,\r\nbefore I discuss Omarska with you, I wanted to ask you a question\r\nabout something you discussed earlier.  You mentioned that the efforts\r\nof the League for Peace were obstructed by the authorities in\r\nPrijedor.  Which authorities obstructed those efforts?\r\nA.  Serbian authorities in addition to the SDA Party. They had a great\r\ninfluence in the municipality and in the SUP.\r\nQ.  So was it Serbian authorities rather than SDA which  resisted the\r\nefforts of the League for Peace?\r\nA.  Correct.\r\nQ.  You also mentioned when you were discussing one of the routes taken in\r\nyour description the street Marsala Tita.  Was that Marsala Tita\r\nStreet in Prijedor town?\r\nA.  Yes, until 30th May it was Marsala Tita Street, 1992.\r\nQ.  Let me ask you now about the places you were held in Omarska camp.\r\nWere you first held in a room in the restaurant building for one\r\nnight?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Looking at the model in front of you, can you use the pointer which is\r\non the table to show us where the restaurant building is located?\r\nA.  The restaurant building is here.  (Indicated).\r\nQ.  In what part of the restaurant building were you initially held?\r\nA.  The buses were parked here.  We went through this entrance and we were\r\nput in this room here.\r\nQ.  After the first night where were you held then, in what part of the\r\ncamp?\r\nA.  I was transferred to the pista, here.\r\nQ.  How long were you there?\r\nA.  I was there for about 10, 11 days.\r\nQ.  Were you in the white house for a couple of nights after that?\r\nA.  Yes, I spent two nights there.\r\nQ.  After that were you held on the upper floor of the hangar building?\r\nA.  Yes, in room No. 15, as it was called.  This is where you enter,\r\nroughly in this area.\r\nQ.  During the later period of your confinement in Omarska, did you stay\r\nin a small room in the restaurant building and also for a short time\r\nin the small garage?\r\nA.  Yes, I did, two days and two nights.\r\nQ.  You may be seated.\r\nA.  Thank you.\r\nQ.  Mr. Beganovic, how would you describe the general conditions of\r\nOmarska camp?\r\nA.  The general conditions are indescribable.  I have no words to describe\r\nit.  I do not know how to tell this to the honoured courtroom.  Every\r\nminute we were upset, we were beaten, psychologically abused, starved,\r\nleft without drink, without drinking, drinks -- simply it is\r\nimpossible to describe.\r\nQ.  When would beatings of prisoners occur?  During what sorts of\r\nactivities by prisoners?\r\nA.  The worst was during the day they interrogated inmates in this\r\nbuilding upstairs from the restaurant. 99 per cent of the people came\r\nback beaten up, and the nights were even more horrible.  After their\r\nhours, work hours, at 5 o'clock they stopped interrogating.  Then\r\nthere were private visits by Serbian soldiers, guards, civilians.\r\nWhoever wanted to go there, go in, did so and looked for inmates,\r\ncalling their names, surnames or nicknames.  We were even taken by\r\npeople who had never met us before.  We lay down on our stomachs in\r\nthe pista.  They would simply come, \"Give me two, give me three\",\r\n\"Here, take five, if you like\".  Simply, people were lying on their\r\nstomachs.  Someone comes and kicks you, \"Stand up, stand up, you and\r\nyou and you\".  I do not  know that anyone came back, any of those\r\npeople came back.\r\nQ.  Were prisoners beaten on their way to the restaurant for their meal\r\nand on their way to use the toilet when they were permitted to do so?\r\nA.  Yes, every day.\r\nQ.  Were you beaten on your way to the restaurant or on your way to use\r\nthe toilet?\r\nA.  Yes, regularly when I was in the group.\r\nQ.  Were you also called out for special beatings, that is, individual\r\nbeatings while you were in camp?\r\nA.  Yes, I was.\r\nQ.  On how many occasions?\r\nA.  Three times.  However, the last couple of days in the camp I was\r\ncalled out every hour or two because of the blackmail because I was\r\nasked for money.\r\nQ.  Did Dule Tadic participate in one of the three beatings?\r\nA.  Yes.  He did.\r\nQ.  Did you know who Dule Tadic was before the war?\r\nA.  Yes.  I did.\r\nQ.  For how long before the war had you known who he was?\r\nA.  About 10 years.\r\nQ.  How did you happen to know him?\r\nA.  Well, by the force of circumstances.  His arrival in Prijedor brought\r\nhim to the area where I had my restaurant.  He was known to create\r\nconflicts.  He used to come with his karate people, so-called karate\r\npeople. They were usually beaten in Prijedor when they came, but still\r\nthey came.\r\nQ.  Did you know what area he lived?\r\nA.  Yes, I knew him from -- I knew that he was from Kozarac.\r\nQ.  Did you often go to Kozarac?\r\nA.  Yes.  I did.\r\nQ.  Why was that?\r\nA.  Because I had friends, relatives.\r\nQ.  Would you go to cafes in Kozarac?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Did you also see Dule Tadic in Kozarac?\r\nA.  On several occasions, yes, in restaurants, in the streets.  We did not\r\ngreet each other.  We were not friends.\r\nQ.  Would you be with friends who did know him and who did greet him when\r\nyou passed in the street?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Over the 10 years that you mentioned, did you come to know who he was\r\nand to be easily able to recognise him?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  I would like to ask you some questions about the first two beatings\r\nthat you mentioned, the first two times you were called out specially\r\nfor beating.  Did the first one take place during the period of time\r\nthat you were on the pista?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Where were you at the time you were called out?\r\nA.  Half an hour prior to that time they put us in the restaurant room.\r\nIt was bad weather and we were all put back into the restaurant room.\r\nQ.  Did you know the person who called you out?\r\nA.  No.\r\nQ.  Did you later find out who he was?\r\nA.  Later I did.  Other inmates told me that his name was Dragan, that he\r\nwas a relative of Nedzo Delic, the well-known cafe owner, restaurant\r\nowner.  He owned the restaurant Europa in Omarska and another\r\nrestaurant called Europa II in Prijedor.\r\nQ.  How was Dragan dressed?\r\nA.  He was dressed in the grey olive uniform and he had a white military\r\npoliceman's belt.  He had a pistol and he had police batons on each\r\nside of his belt.\r\nQ.  What nationality was Dragan?\r\nA.  I heard in the camp that he was a Serb.\r\nQ.  After calling you out of the restaurant building, did Dragan first\r\ntake you to see someone whom you did know?\r\nA.  Yes, he took me out at this semicircle.  Nikica Janjic was standing\r\nthere.\r\nQ.  Had you had a conflict of some sort with Nikica Janjic before the war?\r\nA.  Yes, about a year and a half before the outbreak of the war, I had a\r\nconfrontation, I had a physical conflict with him.\r\nQ.  Did that occur on an evening when you broke up a fight between Janjic\r\nand his girlfriend and then later intervened when he attacked one of\r\nyour employees?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What did Janjic tell you when you were brought to him?\r\nA.  He said, \"See how times have changed?  Tonight I am going to cut your\r\nthroat\".\r\nQ.  After that did they bring you back to the restaurant building for a\r\nshort time?\r\nA.  Yes, they did bring me back for about half an hour.\r\nQ.  Then were you called out again?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Where were you taken?\r\nA.  I did not hear the question.  They took me to the pista.  At the exit\r\nof the building Dragan started beating me with the baton on the head,\r\non the neck, on the back, the upper part of my back.  He kept hitting\r\nme in that area as we went to the white house.\r\nQ.  You were taken to the white house?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Were other prisoners called out and taken to the white house at\r\napproximately the same time?\r\nA.  Yes, I saw that I was followed by Terzic Sefik, Sefik Terzic, a\r\nwell-known hairdresser from Prijedor, nicknamed \"Kiki\".  Then they\r\ncalled out Asaf after me.  Asaf was in the same restaurant where I\r\nwas.  Then Rezak Hukanovic, nicknamed \"Dzigi\", the three of them and\r\nmyself.\r\nQ.  What was Rezak Hukanovic's occupation?\r\nA.  Rezak Hukanovic, he was a poet and an entertainment manager.  Asaf\r\nKapetanovic was also a well-known businessman in Prijedor and a rich\r\nman.\r\nQ.  Is it fair to say that all three of these men were well-known and\r\nsuccessful people in Prijedor?\r\nA.  Yes, they were very well-known and successful.\r\nQ.  Were all three men Muslims?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Where were you placed when you were taken to the white house?\r\nA.  I was placed in the second room on the right.  The other three were\r\nplaced in the second room to the left, as far as I could assess.\r\nQ.  What happened when you were taken to the second room on the right?\r\nA.  They started beating me immediately, and Dragan and Nikica were the\r\nonly people there with me.  The other Serbian soldiers were on the\r\nother side where the other three were.\r\nQ.  What did Dragan and Nikica do to you in the white house?\r\nA.  They beat me, both of them.  Dragan was hitting me with a baton.\r\nNikica kicked me.  I do not remember whether he used an object,\r\nwhether he used an object to hit me, but he mostly kicked me.  I tried\r\nto protect myself as much as I could using my hands, but occasionally\r\nI saw people coming from the other room.  It was Saponja, the handball\r\nplayer from Prijedor.  He used to be my friend.  His parents, their\r\nwedding took place in my house, because they had just moved to\r\nPrijedor, they had not found a dwelling place yet.  So his father and\r\nmy father were very good friends.  His mother borrowed my mother's\r\ndress to get married in.\r\nOthers came in too, there was also the well-known murderer from\r\nbefore the war Zigic and then Duca, Dusko Knezevic.  They came in from\r\ntime to time carrying various objects.  They also had some cables,\r\nelectric cables, and with a ball on top of it welded on to the  cable.\r\nI do not know how they made those devices, but they used these --\r\nused everything that was available to beat us.  But in this beating\r\nDragan and Nikica were the main individuals who beat us, the others\r\njust came in from time to time to beat us.\r\nQ.  How long did the beating continue?\r\nA.  It was an eternity, as far as I was concerned, but maybe about half an\r\nhour.\r\nQ.  At some point did they order you to lie down on the ground, on the\r\nfloor?\r\nA.  Yes.  Dragan ordered me to lie down, to stretch out my arms, with my\r\nstomach facing the floor, but we knew, the inmates knew, that in many\r\ncases their spines were broken.  I tried to resist not to lie down.  I\r\ntold them to kill me.  I said I did not want to lie down. I refused to\r\nlie down.\r\nQ.  What happened after that?\r\nA.  At one point there was something like a desk and a chair.  I do not\r\nknow how I found myself on that chair. As far as I remember, my left\r\narm, my left arm was on the desk and at one point Nikica took out a\r\nknife about this size.  I thought, because he had told me that he\r\nwould cut my throat, that he had taken the knife in order to cut my\r\nthroat.  Almost automatically I started to lift my arm and I felt at\r\nthat moment that a knife stabbed my hand and I still had still have\r\nthe scar.\r\nThe blood spurred out of the wound, spurted.  At that point I lost\r\nconsciousness and then I know that they took me out of that room.  At\r\nthat point the other three friends of mine were coming out of the\r\nother room and  they took us out, out of the white house.\r\nQ.  While you were being beaten, could you tell what was happening to the\r\nother prisoners who had been called out?\r\nA.  We just heard screams and moans.  I was not interested in others.  I\r\nwas in such a bad condition that I was not able to worry about others\r\nbecause my own life was at risk.\r\nQ.  After the beating were you held in the white house?\r\nA.  They took us out and led us towards the pista, and at one point Zigic\r\nsaid, told us to bend down and to drink the water next to the kerb\r\nlike dogs, and that we should behave like dogs and drink the water\r\nlike dogs.  We drank the water which we were glad to do because my\r\nthroat was dry.  At that moment those bad words had no meaning to me.\r\nQ.  After that were you returned to stay in the pista or were you taken\r\nback to the white house?\r\nA.  After that the three of them were taken towards the pista, the\r\nrestaurant.  I was ordered by Dragan to go back to the white house.\r\nHe started hitting me again on the way to the white house.  He hit me\r\na couple of times and then he threw me into the first room to the\r\nleft.\r\nQ.  Did you stay there for that night and the following night?\r\nA.  No, I stayed there that night until about 10.00 or 11.00 in the\r\nmorning.  Then they returned us, a whole group of us -- there were\r\nabout 150 or 200 in the group  -- to spend the night in the white\r\nhouse.\r\nQ.  During the time you were in the white house did a guard see you and\r\ncomment on your condition?\r\nA.  When I entered that room I saw there were about 10 or 12 young men in\r\ncivilian clothes.  We knew already that the room was assigned for\r\nso-called Muslim extremists who had attacked Prijedor, and we also\r\nknew that nobody would come alive out of that room.\r\nIn the evening, about 8 or 9 o'clock, maybe 10.00, I cannot quite\r\nremember, a guard came up to the window. Slavko Ecimovic was there in\r\nprison, my friend from school and from childhood.  He told him at one\r\nmoment,  \"You say you did not attack Prijedor, look, look in your\r\ngroup, there is even a black man\", and he had a flash light on and I\r\nknew that it was trained at me.  As far as I could move, because my\r\npain was horrible, I said, \"I am not a black man.  I have been here\r\nfor 12 days in the pista.  I was on the pista mostly and they came\r\nprivately and beat me up\".  The man remained breathless and said, \"Is\r\nit possible?\"  He went around through the door.  He crouched next to\r\nme.  He again directed his flash light at me.  He said, \"Mother\r\nfuckers, is it possible to beat up a man like they beat you up?\"\r\nI saw that he was speaking, that he was honest about it.  I said, I\r\nasked him if he could help me to be transferred to the pista, to the\r\ngroup that I belonged to because my life was at risk where I was, that\r\nthose young men had come after me and I have no connection with them.\r\nHe said that at that moment he could not promise anything, but he\r\nwould try to transfer me, which he did.\r\nHe came the following morning about 8.00 or 9.00 and visited me.  I\r\nthink his name was a Radenko.  He left.  He said he did not know\r\nnothing, he could not tell  me anything that is concrete.  So he came\r\nabout 10.00, at 11 o'clock in the morning, he took me out and led me\r\nto the hangar.  There were some wash basins there.  He told me to\r\nwash.  There was a mirror there and then everything became clear to\r\nme.  I looked at myself in the mirror and I saw what I looked like.\r\nQ.  Mr. Beganovic, what was the condition of the other prisoners in the\r\nwhite house?\r\nA.  Horrible, incredible, very similar to mine.  There may have been worse\r\ncases than me.  People could not move mostly.  There were people who\r\ncould not move a single centimetre without a moan.\r\nQ.  How long after you were transferred to room 15 was it before the\r\nsecond beating occurred?\r\nA.  Maybe two days.\r\nQ.  Who called you out on that occasion?\r\nA.  Nikica Janjic.\r\nQ.  Where were you at the time?\r\nA.  That day they took us out of room No. 15, all of us, because of a list\r\nthat they were about to make.  They were making some lists.  We were\r\non the lawn between the white house and the red house.\r\nQ.  Where did Janjic take you?\r\nA.  To the white house.\r\nQ.  Was there any other Serb there?\r\nA.  Yes, there was a guard Commander, Kvocka, and a guard.  I know his\r\nnickname was Ckalja.\r\nQ.  Did you see any other Serbs there?\r\nA.  There were always guards.  They were just hanging around.  We were not\r\nparticularly interested to observe  them.\r\nQ.  Was there any other Serb in the white house when Janjic took you\r\nthere?\r\nA.  I was promised safety by Ckalja.  It was really just a formality so\r\nthat I could be dragged into the white house, because I said, \"This is\r\nwhat they have done to me.  The man wants to cut my throat\".  He says,\r\n\"I guarantee your safety.  Go in and have a word with him\".  So I\r\nknew that I had to go in, so I did.\r\nA small, skinny soldier, about 160 metres tall, with a jacket\r\nremained at the doorway with a bag, with a big bag on his back.  It\r\nlooked funny with an automatic rifle, and Nikica started beating me at\r\nthe same moment. The other man was standing at the door to prevent me\r\nfrom fleeing.\r\nQ.  How did Nikica Janjic beat you in the white house on that occasion?\r\nA.  At first he kicked me with his feet, then beat me with hands.  Then he\r\ntook out his Colt pistol, and I always remembered what he told me, and\r\nbegan to beat me with the pistol handle on the head.  My head was all\r\nswollen already, but he went on hitting me with that pistol and made\r\nholes in my head.  Perhaps it was a good for me because the blood had\r\nalready coagulated and was all so swollen, and perhaps all this\r\ncoagulated blood then came out from the body through those wounds he\r\ninflicted at that moment.  So perhaps that is how I can explain that\r\nmy skull did not burst.\r\nQ.  How long did that beating continue for?\r\nA.  It went on for a long time, 20 minutes perhaps.  He  was already\r\ntired.  He was sweating.  His shirt was wet with sweat and he was\r\nsweating all over.  He was quite a big guy.  So that at one point he\r\nstopped beating me. I asked him to listen to me, to bear up with me\r\nfor a couple of minutes and then, if he wanted to, he could go on\r\nbeating me or just do me any or, at any rate, finish with me.  To my\r\nsurprise, he agreed to talk to me.\r\nQ.  What did you tell him or what did he tell you during that discussion?\r\nA.  Well, I told him as regards that conflict that we had before, and that\r\nI assumed the responsibility for it, yes, I had hit him, but now what\r\nhe had done on those two occasions I thought that was a sufficient tit\r\nfor tat and that I did not hold any grudges against him, not too much,\r\nand that he should either kill me or let me be, and to make his\r\nchoice, to do what he wanted but, at any rate, to finish somehow with\r\nme.\r\nSo he thought for a while and said, \"I will let you live.  I will\r\nnot kill you\".  After that he started talking with me more and more.\r\nI could not speak any more.  I remember as I asked him to take me out,\r\nbut then he sent one of those lads who was standing with the automatic\r\nin the doorway to go and bring some water.  He did, and let me drink\r\nwater.\r\nI washed a little, that is, washed the blood off my face.  He said\r\nthank my mother because she told me not to kill you.  She made me\r\nswear that I would not kill you because you are an only son and she\r\nhad an only son, and she advised him in this way.  Perhaps this had\r\ntaken the upper hand, this prevailed, and he did not kill me and he\r\nkept his word and did not come again.\r\nQ.  After that did you continue to be held in room 15 and were you in room\r\n15 when the third beating occurred?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  How long after this second beating was it before the third beating\r\ntook place?\r\nA.  Well, that too about two days.\r\nQ.  About what time was it when you were called out?\r\nA.  It was late in the afternoon, maybe, around 6 o'clock.\r\nQ.  Did you see who called you out or just hear a voice?\r\nA.  I only heard a voice.\r\nQ.  Where was the voice coming from?\r\nA.  The voice came from the entrance, from the door of room No. 15.\r\nQ.  After being called out did you leave the room?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  When you did what did you see?\r\nA.  I saw somewhere in the middle, halfway up the stairs Dragan standing.\r\nQ.  Mr. Beganovic, in a moment I am going to ask you to get up from the\r\nchair and point out on the model -- if you can wait just a moment I\r\nwill have the roofs removed  -- where you were when you were called\r\nout, where room 15 was.  If the roofs could be removed from the\r\nmodels? Both roofs of the big building?\r\nMr. Beganovic, I do not know if the cameras will be able to pick\r\nthis up, but you will be able to read the numbers.  If you can walk\r\nover to the model and both point what room you were in and then tell\r\nus what numbers  are written there.  You can remove your headphones\r\nfor that and then return to your seat.  Can you point to room 15, the\r\narea that comprised room 15?\r\nA.  (The witness indicated on the model).\r\nQ.  Are the numbers written on the floor of the area which comprised room\r\n15?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Speaking loudly, can you tell us what those numbers are?\r\nA.  B7, 23.\r\nTHE INTERPRETER:  We can barely hear the witness.  I am sorry.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Mr. Beganovic, if you can remember the numbers and turn to\r\nthe microphone immediately behind you, the interpreters will be able\r\nto pick up what you are saying.\r\nA.  Repeat the numbers?\r\nQ.  Yes, can you repeat the numbers that are shown in room 15?\r\nA.  B23, B8, and three times B7.\r\nQ.  As you are looking at the model now, which way did you go to leave\r\nroom 15?\r\nA.  I was lying in this corner, then here, here were the wash basins and I\r\ncame out of this door.\r\nQ.  All right, and then went down the stairs?\r\nA.  Down the stairs.\r\nQ.  You can take your seat again, Mr. Beganovic.  Thank you.  Mr.\r\nBeganovic, you said you saw Dragan; is that the same Dragan who had\r\nbeen involved in beating you before?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  How was he dressed on this occasion?\r\nA.  The same.\r\nQ.  Again the military uniform with the white belt?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Did he say anything to you?\r\nA.  During those beatings when I was put in that room, one of the\r\ndetainees had bandaged my head with some white cloth.  I do not know\r\nwhat it was, a t-shirt or a shirt but, at any rate, it was a white rag\r\nto stop the bleeding, and that cloth had stuck to my head and just\r\nstayed there.  I did not even try to remove it because it had all\r\nhardened already with the blood.  So that I came out with this to face\r\nhim, and he said, \"What do you need that on your head for?  You are\r\nnot a Hodza, you sell flowers\", and I had nothing to tell him in\r\nresponse.  He told me to come down.\r\nQ.  When he said, \"You are not a Hodza, he was mocking the bandage on your\r\nhead as if it was a turban?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  When you went down the steps what happened?\r\nA.  The moment I came down the stairs he started beating me, I think with\r\na baton again.\r\nQ.  Did he push you or direct you to any particular part of the hangar\r\nbuilding?\r\nA.  He directed me towards the hangar, towards the inside of the hangar.\r\nQ.  That would be the ground floor of the hangar?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Were other Serbs there waiting?\r\nA.  There was a group of soldiers wearing different kinds  of clothes, but\r\nthey were all military uniforms.\r\nQ.  Approximately, how many in this group?\r\nA.  Well, I should say seven to 10.\r\nQ.  Was Dule Tadic a member of this group?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  When you got to the group what did they do?\r\nA.  Well, I burst in among them and they simply at the same time started\r\nbeating me as usual, beating with different objects, mostly with the\r\nfeet, boots, those soldiers boots, also some sticks, some metal rods,\r\nsome metal cables, with all sorts of things.\r\nQ.  Was Dule Tadic one of those actively involved in hitting and kicking\r\nyou?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  Do you remember what he was wearing on that occasion?\r\nA.  He had the multi-coloured military uniform.\r\nQ.  Do you remember whether he was clean shaven or had a beard?\r\nA.  Well, he looked unkempt, like all of them rather unkempt, untidy a\r\nbeard very untidy.  He did not have a real beard.\r\nQ.  But he had some days growth of beard?\r\nA.  Yes.  Yes.\r\nQ.  How long did the beating continue?\r\nA.  It went on between 20 minutes and half an hour.\r\nQ.  Did you lose consciousness during the beating?\r\nA.  In the hangar on the ground floor, no.  I did upstairs when it was all\r\nover and when I went up.\r\nQ.  Did you attempt to remain conscious during the beating for a\r\nparticular reason?\r\nA.  Yes, because I realised that if I fainted I would never wake up again\r\nbecause they simply killed.\r\nQ.  As the beating continued where did you end up?\r\nA.  It ended, I ended up in the hall -- they were beating me and I fell\r\namong some pillars, if I recollect, I think they were white and red as\r\nif some markings to mark, to bind off a particular area where some\r\nwork goes on so one cannot enter that area.  So I was among those\r\npillars somehow. I do not know how I got there.  At one point I could\r\nnot, I was not even trying to come out from amongst those pillars and\r\nthen two came, approached me, I do not know who they were, I cannot\r\nremember, and they got me by my feet and hung me up by a cord.\r\nQ.  What was this -- the translation says they hung you up by a cord.\r\nWhat kind of a device was this?\r\nA.  I cannot really remember properly, whether it was plated but it was --\r\nthere was a canal nearby and I think that cord, that cable served to\r\nlift some weight, some engines or something like that.  Some large and\r\nheavy object I think it served to lift those things up.\r\nQ.  How long were you hanging there by your feet upside-down?\r\nA.  I could not determine the time with any precision, but not long,\r\nseveral minutes, one minute, two, three, I do not remember exactly.\r\nAt any rate at some point I felt that my feet had slid out and I fell\r\ndown and at that moment I remember Dragan approached me again and\r\nasked if I knew who he was.\r\nQ.  What did you tell him?\r\nA.  I told him I did not know him, that I had never seen  him in my life\r\nbefore, that I did not know who he was.\r\nQ.  Why did you tell him you did not know who he was and that you had\r\nnever seen him before?\r\nA.  Well, because it was a fact in the camp, it was a common fact in the\r\ncamp that they never left alive those witnesses who might possibly\r\nrecognise those guards who killed and tortured.  Simply, they left no\r\nwitnesses behind.  I realised simply that it would be better for me to\r\nsay that I did not know him, and even had I known him before I would\r\nhave said that I did not.\r\nQ.  After you told Dragan you had never seen him before, what did he tell\r\nyou?\r\nA.  He said, \"Take this one upstairs and bring me Senad Muslimovic\".\r\nQ.  Did you go upstairs?\r\nA.  Yes, I started upstairs.  I reached the staircase. I did not even know\r\nthat I did not have my sneakers on, and at one point they said, \"Go\r\nback and fetch your sneakers.\" I said, \"I don't need them\", and Dragan\r\nsort of said: \"You want me to fetch them for you?  Come here.\" So what\r\ncould I do?  I had to go back and they started beating me again.  How\r\nI managed to bend down and pick up those sneakers I do not know but I\r\nknow I did.  Then I climbed up the stairs and entered room 15, and\r\nwhen I was there I made may way to that corner where my place was and\r\nI fainted.\r\nQ.  Do you know how long you lost consciousness for?\r\nA.  I do not know how long I was unconscious, but from what my friends\r\ntold me, those who washed me with water that brought it from the wash\r\nbasin, several minutes, it  was several minutes.\r\nQ.  When you regained conscious, could you tell whether other prisoners\r\nwere being beaten downstairs?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What were you able to hear?\r\nA.  I heard screams, screams that I had not known before.  Until I arrived\r\nin that camp I had never heard such cries, such screams.  They were\r\nhuman, but I could never imitate them.  I remember I asked a friend\r\nRizah Salas who helped me throughout my stay in the camp and at a\r\npoint saved my life, if I was also letting out such screams, and he\r\nsaid: \"We heard you, no, not even remotely like that.\"\r\nQ.  Within the next couple of days did you find out who had been beaten\r\ndownstairs?\r\nA.  Could you repeat the question, please?\r\nQ.  Within the next couple of days after that did you learn who had been\r\nbeaten downstairs and whose screams you had heard?\r\nA.  Yes, we learnt, I think the next day, that it was my friend Jasko,\r\nthat Emir Karabasic was there who one day before had visited me in the\r\n15 and then they had sent him to ask money from the inmates, to\r\ncollect some money, and probably that was how he had managed to enter\r\nthe room and reach me and be with me for a while and just patted me on\r\nthe head and said: \"Take care of yourself, don't worry you will get\r\nout\", but he did not stay long. He went out.\r\nQ.  What was Jasko's last name?\r\nA.  Hrnic.\r\nQ.  Where were those men from?\r\nA.  Kozarac.\r\nQ.  Mr. Beganovic, what injuries did you receive from the beatings?\r\nA.  The injuries, they are both bodily and mental, but those physical\r\ninjuries are worse.  I have fractures on my head, my head was all\r\npierced, was all in holes.  My hand is injured.  I cannot really use\r\nit and I think it is even thinner than my right one.  Then my spine is\r\nhurt.  My kidneys are injured, my leg.\r\nQ.  Did you receive medical care for your injuries in camp?\r\nA.  Well, only in so far as the prisoners could help me. You mean whether\r\nI received any treatment after the camp?\r\nQ.  No, in Omarska itself.\r\nA.  Well, there was treatment amongst ourselves.  We looked after one\r\nanother.  Dr. Eso, because my nose was all to the right and Eso\r\nmanaged to return it.  How well he succeeded you can see for\r\nyourselves.\r\nQ.  Did Dr. Sadikovic have medical supplies with which to treat you?\r\nA.  There were no medicines or any supplies.  From time to time he would\r\ngo upstairs above the restaurant and there he tended, he looked after\r\nthe Serb soldiers who came back from the front, those who were\r\nwounded, because people often inflicted wounds on themselves when\r\ncleaning their weapons.  So he did go upstairs to treat them and then\r\nhe would manage to get some pills or bandages and some powders.  I\r\nremember him bringing some phials, some bottles.  I think he used\r\nthose powders to make  something.  He had one syringe and he used it\r\nfor everything.\r\nQ.  So Dr. Sadikovic received medical supplies to treat Serb soldiers and\r\nsmuggle whatever he could to help the Muslim prisoners who were\r\ninjured?\r\nA.  Yes, but it was very, very small quantities.\r\nQ.  Did your wounds become infected?\r\nA.  Yes.\r\nQ.  What was the condition of your wounds?\r\nA.  The worst were head injuries, because that cloth, the bandage I had,\r\nit was on my head for about a month and it was all rotting and there\r\nwere worms.  Fortunately Dr. Eso noticed that and asked a guard to\r\ntake me out when I was in this room above the restaurant and there was\r\na water tap here, to go out and for about two days he kept begging me\r\nto go out and I did not dare because I was afraid that one of them\r\nwould come and recognise me because there were rumours in the camp\r\nthat I had succumbed.  But he eventually did prevail upon me and I\r\nagreed.  He said  that  I  simply  had  to .  So I agreed and he took\r\nme out to that tap and there for about an hour he was wetting it and\r\nmanaged to remove those bandages.  There were worms in it.  I did not\r\nknow that. I learned that the next day and that was why he put\r\npressure on me to wash it, I was to wash it off.\r\nQ.  Did other prisoners have worms and infected wounds?\r\nA.  Yes, quite a number of cases.  There were guys who had wounds on their\r\nbacks or all over the body but, for instance, on the backs there were\r\nsome chaps where two or three litres of pus would simply spurt out on\r\nthe back.  They had things like a balloon on their backs and it would\r\nfinally burst.  So there were quite a number of people who were still\r\nalive and yet from whom worms were coming out.\r\nQ.  Now you have mentioned Dr. Sadikovic on several occasions, both in\r\nconnection with his efforts with the League for Peace and in the ways\r\nhe attempted to treat Muslim prisoners.  What happened to Dr.\r\nSadikovic in Omarska?\r\nA.  Until 5th August he was with us all the time in this room above the\r\nrestaurant where we stayed in this small room with 20 or 25 of us.  On\r\n5th August he was taken out, perhaps around 11 o'clock in the evening,\r\nit was night time, and before that at least on two occasions he had\r\nbeen taken out and brought back and he was told to take his things\r\nwith him, although he had nothing.  We had said goodbye to him on two\r\noccasions, and on the third occasion when he was called out he turned\r\nand said to us, \"Fuck you all\".  That is what he told us, jokingly.\r\nQ.  Did you ever see or hear of Dr. Sadikovic again?\r\nA.  When I came out from the camp in '93, in March, I heard from a\r\nrelative, from Azo's relative that she had heard from three sides and\r\nfrom different Serb soldiers that he had been in the camp at Ric near\r\nBihac and that he had personally treated them.  However, after that I\r\ncould not learn anything, even though I keep on enquiring but to no\r\navail.\r\nQ.  Mr. Beganovic, can you look and tell us if Dule Tadic is in court\r\ntoday?\r\nA.  Yes, he is, Serb garbage.\r\nQ.  Sir, please refrain from that language, if you would, and can you\r\npoint out -- I know you pointed ----\r\nA.  I apologise to your Lordships.  I could not stop myself.\r\nQ.  You have pointed to where he is sitting.  Can you just tell us what he\r\nis wearing, please, or exactly where he is sitting?\r\nA.  He is sitting in the back row in the middle.  He has a dark red tie.\r\nQ.  Your Honour, may the record reflect the identification of the accused?\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Yes, the record will so reflect the identification\r\nof the accused by the witness.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Mr. Beganovic, are you absolutely certain that this is the\r\nman who participated in the beating of you which took place on the\r\nhangar floor?\r\nA.  Absolutely.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Thank you.  I have nothing further.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  You have cross-examination, Mr. Kay?\r\nMR. KAY:  Yes, I do your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  We will recess early.  We will stand in recess until\r\n2.30, please.\r\n(Luncheon Adjournment)\r\nPRIVATE\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Kay, cross-examination?\r\nMR. KAY:  Thank you, your Honour.\r\nCross-Examined by MR. KAY\r\nQ.   Mr. Beganovic, from what you have told us, it seems that these three\r\nserious beatings that you suffered occurred within the period of a\r\nweek, is that right?\r\nA.   Roughly.\r\nQ.   The first beating was largely the responsibility of Dragan, is that\r\nright?\r\nA.   And Nikica Janjic.\r\nQ.   And Nikica Janjic?\r\nA.   Janjic.\r\nQ.   And Dragan's other name is what?\r\nA.   I do not know any other name.\r\nQ.   Would it be Dragan Vujic or something beginning with the letter \"V\"?\r\nCan you remember?\r\nA.   I have heard something about it in the camp, but that does not seem\r\nto be true.  There seems to be another surname.\r\nQ.   Right.  The reason why I put that to you is from the statement that\r\nyou gave to the Prosecution.  You gave, if you may remember, a number\r\nof names for Dragan that began with \"V\", is that right?\r\nA.   Yes, but then I pointed out that I was not sure ---\r\nQ.   Yes.\r\nA.   -- what was involved.\r\nQ.   Yes, does it seem to be that it was your impression it could have\r\nbeen a name beginning with \"V\"?\r\nA.   I am not sure.  That was just guessing by inmates, but the fact is\r\nthat he is related to Nedzo Delic, that he had worked  for him that he\r\nhad worked in the restaurant in Omarska, in Europa, and the other\r\nEuropa in Prijedor.\r\nQ.   Yes.\r\nA.   His identity is easy to establish.\r\nQ.   Yes.  The second beating that took place upon you, again Nikica\r\nJanjic was involved, is that right?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Was Dragan involved in that as well?\r\nA.   Not in the second beating.\r\nQ.   Thank you.  The third beating that took place took place in the large\r\nbuilding before you on that model which we call the hangar, is that\r\nright?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   You had been recovering from those previous beatings in a room that\r\nyou have identified by calling room 15?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   I was unable to see from here, but I believe you pointed to a fairly\r\nlarge room in the middle of the model on the first floor, is that\r\nright?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Thank you.  You had been in that room for how many days before the\r\nthird beating took place?\r\nA.   About five or six days.\r\nQ.   Presumably, in that period of time you were in an appalling physical\r\nstate with bad and serious injuries to your body?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   And with no medical treatment to restore you and relieve pain?\r\nA.   Correct.\r\nQ.   Were there a number of other men in that room in a similar  condition\r\nat that time?\r\nA.   Yes, there was a large number of injured people.  I cannot tell you\r\nfor sure how many because I was in a corner, but I know that there\r\nwere many such people similar to me, beaten up.\r\nQ.   That room that you were in, room 15, were there many people also\r\nconfined into that space?\r\nA.   Yes, several hundred people, maybe 300.\r\nQ.   Presumably as well, many of them were suffering the same bad\r\nconditions in relation to their eating, sanitation and drinking that\r\nyou had experienced?  Is that right?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   This is something that you would never have experienced in your life\r\nbefore?\r\nA.   Normally.\r\nQ.   Something that probably drove you to the limit of your endurance?\r\nA.   Yes, I was at the limit of my endurance.\r\nQ.   The position that you were being kept within in this room,\r\npresumably, suffered from lack of ventilation and would have been a\r\nroom that was baking in the sun because of the weather at the time,\r\nwould that be right?\r\nA.   How can you bake in the sun in a closed room?\r\nQ.   We heard from one witness about the outside temperature being so hot\r\nthat the rooms in that building because of the tin roof had an almost\r\noven effect and caused the conditions to be very hot.\r\nA.   It was hot, yes.\r\nQ.   On the occasion of the third beating, you were still in room 15?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Had you had much opportunity to obtain food during the period of the\r\nprevious week?\r\nA.   I did not go out to eat.  I ate what I was given by my friends, a\r\npiece of bread in their pockets.  That is all I ate.\r\nQ.   Presumably, that was to avoid further contact with guards as well as\r\nbecause of your strength, would that be right?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   You have described being in a corner of room 15.  Would that have\r\nbeen a corner furthest from the door which you indicated on the model\r\nwas the door how you actually entered the room, or was it a corner\r\nnearer the door?\r\nA.   I was in the right-hand corner and the left-hand corner was further\r\naway from the door than the right-hand corner.\r\nQ.   Was it the opposite end of the room though to the door?\r\nA.   As you enter the main door, you pass the first part of the room.  On\r\nthe one side there are showers, on the other side wash basins.  You go\r\ninto this part of the room.  I was lying on the right-hand side in the\r\ncorner.  So the left-hand corner is further away than the right-hand\r\ncorner.\r\nQ.   I think that gives us an indication as to where you were. You said\r\nthat it was later in the afternoon around 6 o'clock that you heard a\r\nvoice from the entrance to the door.  Did that voice call your name?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Did you then go down the room to the door to see the person who\r\ncalled your name?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Was that Nikica or another guard or someone else?  Can you tell us\r\nwho that was?\r\nA.   It was Dragan, the one we talked about a while ago.\r\nQ.   Dragan was standing there, and was he on his own or with anyone else?\r\nA.   On his own.\r\nQ.   Then did he take you down the stairs to the ground floor of the\r\nbuilding?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Did he tell you at all what was going to happen, why he had called\r\nyour name?\r\nA.   No.\r\nQ.   Did you have any feelings in your own mind as to why he called your\r\nname then?\r\nA.   Since I had experienced -- I had experience with him, I knew what to\r\nexpect roughly, but I prayed to God that he would kill me so that I\r\nwould not be tortured any more.\r\nQ.   Can you remember when abouts during your stay in Omarska this was?\r\nA.   In the middle of June.  I cannot be sure of two or three days, but\r\nthat is the time.\r\nQ.   Of course not.  I understand it would seem from what you are saying\r\nif it was in the middle of June that you may have been in the camp for\r\nsome two-and-a-half weeks by then, would that be right?\r\nA.   Yes, about two weeks.\r\nQ.   When you left that room and went down the stairs with Dragan and you\r\nsaid that he was the only guard there, were there other guards,\r\nnothing to do with this incident, around on the stairs or nearby as\r\nyou went down?\r\nA.   As I went down, there was nobody, but when he told me to go towards\r\nthe hangar I saw the group in the hangar, I saw the group which would\r\ntorture me later on.\r\nQ.   You have referred there to the hangar.  We know that this was a\r\nmining complex and we know what this building was used for when it was\r\nworking as a mine.  Can you tell us what was actually in the hangar at\r\nthis time?\r\nA.   There were some parts of probably dump trucks, lorries. I think there\r\nwas a dump truck further down on the left-hand side as you enter the\r\nhangar, left of the canal.  It was not important to me at the time\r\nwhat was there.  The only thing I was concerned with was the criminals\r\nwhen I entered.\r\nQ.   Was it used at all at this time for the holding of any of the\r\nprisoners within Omarska?\r\nA.   Which area do you have in mind?\r\nQ.   I ask this because we have heard evidence that at some stage, I do\r\nnot know when, the prisoners were kept in an area of this hangar, and\r\nwhat I am asking you is if at that time when you went down whether\r\nthat was the case then?\r\nA.   True, but at that time there had not been -- by that time there had\r\nnot been any inmates in the hangar.\r\nQ.   So what appears to have been within it was equipment connected with\r\nlorries and the use of those lorries, is that right?\r\nA.   About that, yes.\r\nQ.   When you went into the hangar, you have described what you say is the\r\ngroup of criminals.  How many people did you see there in this group?\r\nA.   I did not get round to counting them, but there were between seven\r\nand 10.\r\nQ.   Dragan had brought you down from the upstairs of the building.  Did\r\nyou have to walk with any help or what was your physical condition in\r\nrelation to how you could move at that  time?\r\nA.   I was still able to stand on my feet.\r\nQ.   Would it be fair to say that that would have been though with quite a\r\ndegree of pain and discomfort?\r\nA.   Of course.\r\nQ.   Yes.  Those various beatings that you had received on those other two\r\noccasions had been beatings, from what you have told us, over the\r\nwhole of your body?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   You described the group of men as wearing different kinds of clothes,\r\nbut that they were all military uniforms?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Are you able to tell us what different kinds of military uniforms\r\nthose clothes would have been?\r\nA.   Some of them wore multi-coloured uniforms, we called them\r\nmulti-colours, and others had grey olive uniforms of the former JNA.\r\nQ.   When you say \"multi-coloured uniforms\", is that camouflage uniforms?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Did any of them wear berets, hats of any kind?\r\nA.   They did, but at that time it did not make any difference whether he\r\nhad a hat on or not.  We were not interested in that at all.\r\nQ.   I am just asking you this to get an idea of the various kinds of\r\nclothing that were being worn.  Can you remember any particular kinds\r\nof hats or berets, if there were any?\r\nA.   They had hats, caps.  They dressed as they pleased.  They did not\r\nlook like an army.  It looked like a band of wanton people. We could\r\nsee from the start that there was no commanding  hierarchy, no army,\r\nno men.\r\nQ.   Would it be right to say that Dragan was the person who was in charge\r\nof you?\r\nA.   That was my impression, yes.\r\nQ.   He had a military uniform, you said, with a white belt?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Did any of the others have a similar colour belt?\r\nA.   I cannot remember at this time, nor did I try very hard to observe\r\nthat.  I was -- I did not believe that I would come out of the camp\r\nand especially that a day would come that I could testify to being\r\nthere.  If I had been aware of that, I would have remembered and\r\nobserved more.\r\nQ.   I understand that, and do not take any of these questions as being a\r\ncriticism of you.  I am asking them as part of my job, you understand?\r\nCan you remember the kind of footwear perhaps that was being worn,\r\nwhether they were boots or other form of ----\r\nA.   Mostly military boots.\r\nQ.   By that do you mean the black military boot?\r\nA.   Yes, the military boot of the former JNA.\r\nQ.   Yes.  Did you see any weapons there amongst the men, and by that I\r\nmean guns or rifles or machine guns?\r\nA.   They mostly wore automatic weapons and pistols.\r\nQ.   When you say \"wore\" automatic weapons, do you mean they had them with\r\nthem or they were actually on their bodies in some way?\r\nA.   Mostly had them in their hands.\r\nQ.   When you were down there with these men, did you notice if there were\r\nany other prisoners that you could see within the hangar?\r\nA.   While I was there I did not notice any.\r\nQ.   Were you the focus of attention of the group?  They were not doing\r\nanything to anyone else, was it just you?\r\nA.   I did not notice that.  I did not notice anybody else.\r\nQ.   This room, the hangar, was it lit at all?  What were the lighting\r\nconditions within it?\r\nA.   I did not see any lighting.  It was still daylight.\r\nQ.   Yes.  We can see on that model that there are what I would call\r\nroller doors -- I do not know if that translates -- but shutters that\r\ngo up and down, were they up or down?\r\nA.   I did not notice those things.\r\nQ.   Fine.  Within that group when you gave evidence this morning you said\r\nthat Dule Tadic was a member of that group?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Can you name any of the other people who made up that group?\r\nA.   There was another guy who in the first time I was beaten stood in the\r\ndoorway holding an automatic rifle in his hands so that I would not\r\nescape through the door, I noticed him; that Dusko and there was\r\nDragan, others, I did not really notice them except those I knew, but\r\nI had the impression that all the guards were there.  Guards who were\r\non duty there, I did not notice them.\r\nQ.   The one you referred to as also being present the first time you were\r\nbeaten who was in the door with his rifle to stop you escaping, did\r\nyou know his name at all?\r\nA.   No.\r\nQ.   Was he a guard at the camp?\r\nA.   No.\r\nQ.   Were there any guards there from the camp in the hangar at  that\r\ntime?\r\nA.   No, and they would mostly be admitted in, the guards would stay\r\noutside and then they indulged in orgies with us.\r\nQ.   Because Dragan whom you have mentioned, was he actually a guard at\r\nthe camp?\r\nA.   No.\r\nQ.   You were taken into that hangar by Dragan.  You told us that he\r\nstarted hitting you with a baton as you were going down the steps.\r\nWas that the first series of blows on this occasion that you felt?\r\nA.   Yes, he began beating me as I was coming down the stairs when he\r\ndirected me towards the hangar.  That is when he started dealing\r\nblows.\r\nQ.   He was giving this treatment to you and it was coming upon injuries\r\nthat you had already suffered?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   When you got to the bottom of the stairs, how did you get into the\r\nhangar?\r\nA.   On my feet.\r\nQ.   I perhaps did not ask that very clearly but there are big doors, are\r\nthere not, with glass in them, am I right about that?\r\nA.   There was a glass door.\r\nQ.   Yes.  Did you have to open that yourself or did he open it for you\r\nand let you through?\r\nA.   I believe it was open.  Yes, it was open.\r\nQ.   You entered the hangar.  Did he continue beating you?\r\nA.   Yes, towards that group and then the group took over.\r\nQ.   The group, you have identified them as a group which implies that\r\nthey were very much together in close proximity, would that be right?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   As you entered the doors, whereabouts exactly were the group\r\npositioned, can you remember how far from the doors?\r\nA.   Oh, a couple of metres inside the hangar, about halfway in the middle\r\nof the hangar.\r\nQ.   Right.  There are some canals that we know of within this hangar,\r\nmaybe three or four.  Do you know what I am talking about when I refer\r\nto them?  I did not hear any translation.\r\nTHE INTERPRETER: There was none.\r\nMR. KAY:  Do you know what I am talking about when I refer to the canals\r\nwithin the hangar?\r\nA.   Canals to repair dump trucks ---\r\nQ.   That is right.\r\nA.   -- and lorries and things.\r\nQ.   Get underneath them, go into a sort of a pit.  Do you know what I am\r\ntalking about within that hangar?  Did you see those?\r\nA.   I did.\r\nQ.   Are you able to see in relation to those pits whereabouts the men\r\nwere?  Were they on that side or a different part of the hangar?\r\nA.   In that half beyond the canals.\r\nQ.   Yes.  Dragan, presumably, was the man who forced you towards them or\r\ndid they come to meet you?\r\nA.   I went towards them.\r\nQ.   Did anyone talk to you or did the beating just start?\r\nA.   They were not saying anything.  They were simply cursing. During all\r\nthose beatings always there were no conversations of any kind.  They\r\nwould curse at you because you were a Muslim and they would hit you.\r\nI mean, there was no conversation there. They would not let you.  All\r\nthey cared about, how to hit you in  the most vulnerable spot, no\r\ntalking.  Just curses and noise, that is all.\r\nQ.   From the way you describe it, it would be right to say that it was\r\nthe whole group that was involved in attacking you?\r\nA.   Well, the whole group, some probably hit me more times, sometimes\r\nless, but I had no time to count how many times who each of them hit\r\nme.\r\nQ.   Again when you came into that hangar, as you have told us, you were\r\non your feet, you were walking, but you were being hit by Dragan, is\r\nthat right?\r\nA.   It is.\r\nQ.   Was he behind you hitting you or to the side or front hitting you?\r\nCan you tell us whereabouts he was?\r\nA.   Behind me.\r\nQ.   He was hitting you on your back, presumably?  Was it on the back of\r\nyour head?\r\nA.   Yes, the neck, head, shoulders -- that is where he hit me most.\r\nQ.   You yourself had a bandaged head because of the appalling head\r\ninjuries you had suffered the time of the previous beatings, is that\r\nright?\r\nA.   It is.\r\nQ.   The distance that he hit you towards this group was how much, are you\r\nable to tell us?\r\nA.   Five or six metres, perhaps 10, I do not know.  Five or six metres.\r\nQ.   Did the group immediately start hitting you like Dragan was doing?  I\r\nwill repeat the question because I do not think there is a translation\r\nfor the witness.  Did the group start hitting you like Dragan had been\r\ndoing?\r\nA.   Why, they beat me, Dragan used only batons and they used their rifle\r\nbutts, feet, rods, but basically with their feet. Those karateists,\r\nthey were the ones, perhaps they were doing their exercises --\r\ntraining with me.\r\nQ.   Presumably, you would have been kicked or hit to the ground?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   You did not remain on your feet?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   The length of time that this continued for, are you able to tell us\r\nin any way?\r\nA.   Well, about 20 minutes, 15, 20 -- it looked like eternity to me.\r\nQ.   What I want to ask you about is Dusko Tadic, when you first say that\r\nyou came to know of him and his name.  When do you say you first came\r\nacross him, if you like?\r\nA.   I knew of his existence.  I have known it for some 10 years.  As I\r\nhave already said, I knew him from sight.  I knew that he was Dule.  I\r\ndid not know his full name, but I knew he was Dule.  I knew his family\r\nname was Tadic, that he lived in Kozarac and that he was practising\r\nkarate and coaching karate. I knew he was no good, that he was a\r\ntrouble maker.  He used to come to Prijedor on the street where my\r\nbusiness was, and there he was beaten once by Remzo, Cero and those\r\nfriends of mine. I knew all that went on in that street, since my\r\ncoffee bar was the best known and the most popular in Prijedor and\r\nvery many young people came there, so that I know him, you see.  For\r\n10 years I have known who he was, what he was, where he came from.\r\nQ.   So you are talking about being aware of him, is that right, for some\r\n10 years?\r\nA.   Correct.\r\nQ.   Thank you.  If you answer the question because there has to be a\r\ntranslation.  When you say you saw him in the hangar on that occasion\r\nwhen you received the third beating, are you able to describe what he\r\nlooked like?\r\nA.   Well, to my mind, like everybody else when he was wearing a military\r\nuniform.  I remember that, simply I recognised him immediately.\r\nQ.   When you say you recognised him, was there anything about his\r\nappearance that you could describe how he looked?\r\nA.   I have just said briefly, he was not alone so that I would look at\r\nhim only.  I was looking at them, at that group of seven or 10 people,\r\nso that he was the only one whose name I knew from that group.\r\nDragan's name I learnt in the camp and that other one who took part in\r\nformer beatings, I still do not know his name to this day, so it is\r\nquite natural that his name stuck in my mind.  But before that, I have\r\nnever had any trouble with him before.  At that time I was not as\r\nscared of him as thinking of Dragan and what Dragan was going to do to\r\nme.  I believe he could not recognise me because from the previous\r\nbeating, my mine, my face was all disshaped, misshapen, and when the\r\none upstairs had called out my name, I guess that he did not have the\r\nfaintest idea who they were talking about.\r\nQ.   You rightly say that you were not concentrating on one person because\r\nwhat was happening to you involved the whole group of seven or 10,\r\nthat is right, is it not?\r\nA.   Yes, it is.\r\nQ.   You were not being politely taken into this room by Dragan; you were\r\nbeing hit by him from behind?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   From what had happened to you in those previous days, you were not in\r\nyour normal physical condition, that is right, is it not?\r\nA.   Physically, no, naturally, but mentally I was well enough to notice\r\nthat Dule Tadic was there and that he was practising some blows on me.\r\nMore him, I cannot even remember those other faces because they meant\r\nnothing to me.  I did not recognise anyone of them.  They must have\r\nbeen the population from Omarska and perhaps other villages there who\r\nnever came down, so I could not know them nor could they know me.\r\nQ.   When you say that you recollected Dule Tadic because the name stuck\r\nin your mind, it is right to say that you have talked about things\r\nwith other people when you were in the camp then as well as in\r\nManjaca?\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Excuse me.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  I would like to object to a mischaracterisation of the\r\nevidence.  The witness did not say he recollected Dule Tadic because\r\nof the name.  He said that he recognised him for that reason and did\r\nnot know the other names, and so it is natural that he would remember\r\nMr. Tadic.  Counsel is building in a mischaracterisation into that\r\nquestion.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  That is how I recall the testimony. I suppose we\r\ncould have it turned back.\r\nMR. KAY:  I apologise and I am sure the Court will allow me to start again\r\nand put whatever I should put correctly.  You say that the name stuck\r\nin your mind, is that right?\r\nA.   The face features.\r\nQ.   When you say the face and features, had the face or features changed\r\nin any way from how you had seen Dusko Tadic from before?\r\nA.   At that time they had not changed at all.  They are changed now.\r\nQ.   So the person who was hitting you then had a look, an appearance, as\r\nyou say it was Dusko Tadic, he had not changed in his appearance from\r\nwhen you had known him from before, is that right?\r\nA.   It was him, I was not having any halucinations.  I did not have to\r\nthink any.  I am positive.  I was quite sure it was him.\r\nQ.   You see, what I suggest to you is that, in fact, what was happening\r\nto you was so extreme that it was difficult for you to accurately\r\nrecognise Dusko Tadic and be right about it, do you understand?\r\nA.   I was strong enough to recognise him, to know that it was he and not\r\nforced to think whether it was he or not and that I made a mistake.\r\nQ.   You refer to your mental state, but you had suffered appalling\r\ndeprivation in that time in Omarska in terms of your health, physical\r\ncondition, is that not right?\r\nA.   That is right, but I was, I still had enough of my wits about to know\r\nthat it was he, that I could not make a mistake.\r\nQ.   Because what I am putting to you is this, that in fact it was someone\r\nwho looked like him but it was not him?\r\nA.   No, it was he.\r\nQ.   This name is something that you have picked up because others were\r\ntalking about it in the camp?\r\nA.   Why should I?  I knew him more than those other people. There was\r\nnothing -- they could hear it from me, not I from them.\r\nQ.   You have never had a conversation with Dusko Tadic, is that right?\r\nA.   No.\r\nQ.   You have never sat at a table with Dusko Tadic, is that right?\r\nA.   Yes, in a coffee, in the coffee bar just, but not together because we\r\nhad no reason to strike any friendships even before the war.\r\nQ.   Do you know Miso Danicic?\r\nA.   I do not know that surname.\r\nMR. KAY:  Thank you.  I have no further questions.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Tieger, any redirect?\r\nMR. TIEGER:  No, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Is there any objection to -- I am sorry.\r\nJUDGE STEPHEN:  Witness, I have one question to ask you.  Did alcohol play\r\nany part in the camp as far as the guards were concerned or those who\r\ncame in and beat you?  Did they seem to be drunk or not?\r\nA.   Oh, yes, alcohol played a tremendous role there.  They were almost\r\nall drunk and regularly, day in, day out, and we were blackmailed.\r\nThey would take a man, put a pistol in his mouth and say, \"Get me\r\n1,000 marks in\", I do not know, \"within 15 or 20 minutes or we will\r\nkill him\", and of course we had to find that money, whether we knew\r\nthe man or not.  I mean, those who managed somehow to bring the money\r\nin, we collected 10 marks, 15 marks, it depended, but towards the end\r\nwe stopped giving it because we knew that they were going to kill us\r\nall, so we thought, \"What is the use?  He will only suffer more so let\r\nthem\", and then they became even stricter.  They were requesting, I do\r\nnot know, 230 marks and then they dropped the price to a crate of beer\r\nbecause they simply could not do without beer or drink.\r\nQ.   Did the guards have a meeting room, a common room, where they drank\r\nor did you see them drink or do you know anything of how they ate?\r\nWhere did they eat, for instance, the guards?\r\nA.   They do not know it -- yes, while I was in this room behind the\r\nrestaurant, here where this tap is, there was a van and the door of\r\nthis van was always open, the rear door could always be open, and\r\nthere was a machine gun directed at this door through which we entered\r\nbehind the tap, and they drank there non-stop bottles of brandy, of\r\ncognac, crates of beer.  What they ate? What do I know what those scum\r\nate -- pork, must be.\r\nQ.   One other question, you spent some time on the pista in the open air?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Of a night would you sleep on the pista or were you always taken into\r\nthe so-called restaurant at night?\r\nA.   The first four or five days I spent nights on the pista. There was a\r\nmachine gun positioned up here on this roof, and in the evening it was\r\nsighted on us, it was aimed at us, and after some five or six days\r\nthere was a shower so that they would not get soaked and better to\r\nkeep us under control, they forced us into the restaurant.  We would\r\nspend the night there until the day break, and at day break they would\r\nforce us out into the pista. On the pista there were those puddles of\r\nwater after the rain, but who cared?  Each one had to take his place,\r\nwhether wet or dry, and lie down again.\r\nQ.   The last question I wanted to ask you is I take it the pista was\r\nfloodlit at night?\r\nA.   It was lit around it, not where we were.  As far as I can remember,\r\nthere were some lights here and there, but they had a good view.\r\nThere was a wall here and there was this machine  gun.  Joja, one of\r\nthose, I do not know who he is, and he always kept it aimed at us, so\r\nwe had no chance, not even a theoretical chance, to attempt an escape\r\nor a rebellion or something because I think it would not take a minute\r\nto kill us all and sometimes we were 700 or 600, 800 of us, so that we\r\nhad no chance whatsoever.\r\nJUDGE STEPHEN:  Thank you.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Tieger, do you have additional questions?\r\nMR. TIEGER:  No, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Kay?\r\nMR. KAY:  No, thank you, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Is there any objection to Mr. Beganovic being\r\npermanently excused?\r\nMR. KAY:  No, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Beganovic, you are permanently excused.  You are\r\nfree to leave.  Thank you for coming.\r\nTHE WITNESS:  Thank you.  I wish to thank your Lordships.  I am glad that\r\nI did.  I hope I helped you.  I tried to as much as I could.  Thank\r\nyou.\r\n(The witness withdrew)\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Niemann, who will your next witness be?  Mr.\r\nTieger, you will call the next witness.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Yes, your Honour, the next witness is Senad Muslimovic.\r\nSENAD MUSLIMOVIC, called.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Would you take the oath that is being handed to you,\r\nplease?\r\nTHE WITNESS [In translation]:  I solemnly declare that I will speak the\r\ntruth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\r\n(The witness was sworn)\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you, sir.  Would you be seated?\r\nExamined by MR. TIEGER\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Tieger?\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Thank you, your Honour.  Sir, what is your name?\r\nA.   Senad Muslimovic.\r\nQ.   Mr. Muslimovic, you may want to move a little bit away from the\r\nmicrophone when you speak.  What year were you born?\r\nA.   In 1963.\r\nQ.   Where were you born?\r\nA.   Prijedor.\r\nQ.   Were you also raised in Prijedor?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   What is your nationality?\r\nA.   Muslim.\r\nQ.   Did you serve in the JNA?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   When was that?\r\nA.   I think in 1981.\r\nQ.   Before the war exactly where in Prijedor did you live, not the\r\naddress but what part of town?\r\nA.   An area that boarded on the centre of the city called Puharska.\r\nQ.   Mr. Muslimovic, is it correct that you come from a rather well-known\r\nfamily in Bosnia, in particular, because of your brother's success in\r\nthe music business?\r\nA.   I hope that that was the case.  I think that is so.\r\nQ.   Your brother is a very popular and well-known folk singer in Bosnia,\r\nis that right?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   You worked in the music business with him and worked together with\r\nhim when he toured?\r\nA.   That is correct.\r\nQ.   In fact, you spent a great deal of time outside of Prijedor as a\r\nresult of your work?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Prior to the tensions which preceded the actual conflict in Prijedor\r\nand in Bosnia, did people in Prijedor tend to distinguish between who\r\nwas Muslim and who was Serb?\r\nA.   I personally did not.  I think others were not able to do so either.\r\nQ.   Did you have Serb friends?\r\nA.   I had many more Serbian friends than if I can say Muslim friends.\r\nQ.   Was that in part of because of the nature of your work?\r\nA.   I would not be able to tell you exactly.  I had such friends, that\r\nhappens to be the case.  I had those friends and I was fond of them.\r\nQ.   Was it possible to distinguish between a Muslim and a Serb based on\r\ntheir physical appearance, based on their face?\r\nA.   It is impossible for me.  Maybe someone in the world might do that\r\nbut I could not.  I could never do that.\r\nQ.   In addition to your work in the music business, did you also have\r\nyour own grocery business in Prijedor before the war?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   As a result of the tensions which occurred before the conflict\r\nactually began, did you send your wife and children away to Slovenia\r\nfor safety at some point before May?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Were you yourself in Prijedor when the cleansing of  Prijedor town\r\nbegan on May 30th?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Were you seized or arrested the following day?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Had you seen what happened to your home before that, before you were\r\ncaptured?\r\nA.   Yes, certainly.\r\nQ.   What had happened to it, sir?\r\nA.   I watched everything from the part of a town which was opposite my\r\nhouse and called Percani.  I was staying with a friend called Dzevad\r\nDeomic.  I was in his bedroom watching. There were fires here and\r\nthere in the area of Puharska.  At one point from one part of a road\r\ndown from my house, a tank came out and started moving in the\r\ndirection of Banja Luka.  That is the easiest explanation, if I say in\r\nthe direction of Banja Luka, because the road connected Bosanski Novi\r\nand Banja Luka. They passed my house.  I would not be able to tell you\r\nhow many metres, but I know that they crossed the bridge next to my\r\nhouse.  Then they came back and then they trained the barrel towards\r\nmy house and fired at it.  That is all.\r\nQ.   May we call up on the monitor Z5-35?  Looking at the monitor, Mr.\r\nMuslimovic, do you recognise what is shown on it?\r\nA.   Certainly that is my house when it was, the way it looked when it was\r\nbuilt about 10 or 12 years ago.  During the war it was even bigger and\r\nmore beautiful.  It was my family house which belongs to my father, to\r\nmy brother, to my mother.  We lived there together.\r\nQ.   It included the entire structure shown in the picture in addition to\r\na portion which had not yet been built at the time this picture was\r\ntaken?\r\nA.   I did not understand the question, would you please repeat it?\r\nQ.   Your family house consisted of the entire structure shown in this\r\npicture, is that right?\r\nA.   Yes, but 10 years ago, maybe even longer than that, but just before\r\nthe war it was much bigger and more beautiful.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Your Honour, I would tender that in I am not quite sure what\r\nform we can do so.  I would actually like to return the actual\r\nphotograph to the witness, if possible, so if it is technically\r\nfeasible to capture an image of what is on the screen now or certainly\r\na photographic copy.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Take it wherever it is, retrieve it and make a copy\r\nof it.  What Exhibit number will this be then so that we have a hard\r\ncopy?\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Exhibit 253, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Any objection to 253?\r\nMR. WLADIMIROFF:  No, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  OK.  253 will be admitted.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Your Honour, Miss Sutherland suggests that perhaps we could\r\nmake this 253A and the following photograph can be 253B.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Exhibit 253A.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Can we also now call up on the monitor Z5-34?\r\n(To the witness):  Mr. Muslimovic, do you recognise this picture and is\r\nthis a picture of your home after the conflict?\r\nA.   Certainly.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  I would tender this, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Any objection?\r\nMR. WLADIMIROFF:  No, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Exhibit 253B will be admitted.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Thank you.  (To the witness):  Mr. Muslimovic, after you were\r\narrested or seized on May 31st where were you first taken?\r\nA.   I was taken to the police station in Prijedor.\r\nQ.   Were you struck or beaten when you were being transported to the\r\npolice station?\r\nA.   Yes, of course.\r\nQ.   When you arrived was there a group or cordon of Serbian police\r\nwaiting who also beat you?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   While you were at the SUP was there an attempt or a threat of an\r\nexecution?\r\nA.   Not every day but every other day.\r\nQ.   On the day you were taken to the SUP, were you lined up for execution\r\nat some point?\r\nA.   Correct.  Yes.\r\nQ.   Where were you lined up?\r\nA.   I was lined up in the courtyard, if I can call it, of the SUP behind\r\nthe main entrance on the other side next to the wall.  On the\r\nleft-hand side, there was a door.  That is where I was put together\r\nfor the act that they had planned to carry out.\r\nQ.   You said you were on the other side next to a wall, what was the\r\ncondition of that wall?\r\nA.   It was smeared with blood and there were pot marks that looked like\r\nbullet scars, but at that moment nobody paid enough attention to\r\ndecide 100 per cent what sort of hole it was.  When I was placed\r\nthere, the only thing, the only things I could see was the blood and\r\nthe holes.\r\nQ.   What occurred to stop the execution?\r\nA.   For a split moment, after a very short moment, from the main room of\r\nthe SUP building a gentleman who was a stranger to me came out.  I can\r\ncall him a gentleman.  He said that this cannot happen, that we are\r\nloyal citizens of that town and nobody can do us any harm.  But,\r\nhowever, it went on for a certain time and he placed some people to\r\nwatch me like nothing would happen, but it lasted only the time,\r\nduring the time that he was in the doorway.  As soon as he went back,\r\nwe were beaten again, not as badly as later, but there were blows on\r\nthe head with the rifle, just beating, until a situation materialised\r\nin which I was saved.  They usually beat people until someone came\r\nalong who did not like his friend to be beaten without any reason.\r\nThat is all.\r\nQ.   After you were held in the SUP, where were you taken?\r\nA.   After the incident in the courtyard (which seemed very long to me,\r\nlike a year although it must have been short), we were taken to a room\r\nand then from that room we were taken again to the courtyard, if I can\r\ncall it that, where we were delivered many, many blows on all sides.\r\nYou could not observe who was doing it.  We had to bow down and\r\nprotect our head as much as possible.\r\nWe were lined up there, there might have been five, six or\r\nseven.  I did not look around very much in front of me or around me.\r\nI did not have enough courage to do so.  There was also alternative\r\nbeating until they took us to the room, the room, to the premises of\r\nthe main SUP.  If we passed a soldier, that soldier would hit you with\r\na rifle or kick you or you would just get a slap in the face.  We went\r\nthrough the SUP, went out.  We were thrown, not taken, into the bus,\r\nwe were thrown on to a bus, which already had people on it.  That is\r\nall.\r\nQ.   Did that bus take you to Keraterm?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Approximately, how long were you held in Keraterm?\r\nA.   Would you please repeat the question?  How long?  Is it a question\r\nabout my time in Keraterm or the time the trip took?\r\nQ.   No, your time in Keraterm, how long were you actually held in\r\nKeraterm?\r\nA.   I think about -- a day lasted as long as a year, sometimes it was\r\nfaster and very slow, but I think seven or 10 days, but I would not\r\nsay -- I do not think it was 10 days.\r\nQ.   In what part of Keraterm were you held?\r\nA.   Still dark that night, we were chased out of the bus and put in the\r\nfirst room which was located at the corner of the building.  I do not\r\nknow what the purpose of the room was, but it was at the corner\r\nitself.\r\nQ.   During the time you were held in Keraterm were prisoners called from\r\nyour room at night?\r\nA.   Yes, they were.\r\nQ.   Were you able to hear what was happening to them?\r\nA.   Yes, I was able to hear, yes.  It was not small things when you hear\r\na man screaming, yelling, howling, roaring, it is hard to imitate that\r\nunder normal conditions.  That is what I heard, screams, shrieks,\r\nmoans.  That is all.\r\nQ.   Did all the prisoners who were called from the room return?\r\nA.   Generally, it is hard to say what number, you always expect to be the\r\nnext one so you do not think about numbers. Generally, there were more\r\npeople called out than those who returned.\r\nQ.   What was the condition of those who returned?\r\nA.   You know, from our point of view, they looked like they had  been\r\nwounded.  Sometimes they looked like walking corpses.  It seems\r\nimpossible, but that is what they looked like.\r\nQ.   While you were in Keraterm were you called out for interrogation?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   What kinds of questions were you asked during the interrogation?\r\nA.   How should I tell you?  The first question was, \"Where is your money?\r\nWhere did you hide your money?  Where are your weapons?  Why did you\r\nhelp any of the Parties?\"  But, however, I have never been a member of\r\nany political party.  \"How much money did your brother give for this\r\none, for that one?\" Everything was revolved around, \"Where is your\r\nmoney?  Where were you that day, on such-and-such a day, at\r\nsuch-and-such a moment?\"  If I can say so, those questions were stupid\r\nto me. That is all.  I had to say where I had left gold, money, that I\r\ndid not have because I had invested everything.  I did not have any\r\ncapital because I had invested everything, but all the time I was\r\nasked for money.\r\nQ.   When the interrogators were not completely satisfied with your\r\nanswers, what did they tell you?\r\nA.   They would say, \"We have better methods, you will admit eventually\".\r\nQ.   Were you taken out of Keraterm at some point for a short time?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Who took you out of Keraterm?\r\nA.   I was taken by a man who was called by everybody in the camp Zigic,\r\nand whom everybody knew by that nickname.\r\nQ.   Why did this man Zigic take you out of camp?\r\nA.   I can claim that because I was escorted by them to my house, but\r\nfirst they told me to go into Halid's house and look for money and\r\ngold, and then they went to my house and told me to look for it, but I\r\ndid not have any.  You know what happens after that; beatings, torture\r\nand then taking me back to the camp.\r\nQ.   So first they took you to your brother's house and then to your house\r\nlooking for valuables?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   After the period of ---\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   -- of time you indicated, were you taken from Keraterm to Omarska?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   In what part of Omarska were you held after you arrived?\r\nA.   I was placed in room No. 15.  That is what I heard the number was.\r\nThere was no number on it, but that is what it was called, room No.\r\n15.\r\nQ.   Mr. Muslimovic, do not take off your headphones just yet, but I will\r\nask you to get up and point out on the model in front of you -- you\r\nmay use the pointer to your right, if you wish -- where the room in\r\nwhich you were held which you knew as room 15 was.  You may want to\r\nremove your headphones when you walk over and point it out.\r\nA.   Shall I begin?\r\nQ.   Yes, please.  If you could also put on those headphones when you get\r\nover there in case there is something else I need to ask you.\r\nA.   Is that all?\r\nQ.   Yes.  If you could first point to room 15, please?\r\nA.   (The witness indicated on the model).\r\nQ.   Can you read the numbers which are on the floor of the area which\r\ncomprises room 15?\r\nA.   B7, B23 and B8.\r\nQ.   Yes, you can return to your seat.  What did room 15 consist of?\r\nA.   What do you mean?  I did not understand the question.  Are you\r\nreferring to the material it was made of or what it was composed of?\r\nQ.   Let me ask you this question.  Did you have a particular place in the\r\nroom?\r\nA.   Yes.  I was in a shower booth.  It was so big that two of us had to\r\nsleep in it and you know roughly how big it is. Sometimes there were\r\nthree of us sleeping in one shower booth.\r\nQ.   Can we call up Z3, 15-13, please?  Mr. Muslimovic, do you recognise\r\nwhat is shown in this photograph?\r\nA.   Certainly.\r\nQ.   Are those some of the shower booths in room 15?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Was your place on this side or on the other side?\r\nA.   My place cannot be seen on this side.  It is on the left-hand side\r\nand my place was on the left-hand side in the corner.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Your Honour, I would tender this as Exhibit 254.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Any objection?\r\nMR. WLADIMIROFF:  No, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Exhibit 254 will be admitted.\r\nJUDGE STEPHEN:  I wonder if you would tell the witness again to keep back\r\nfrom the microphone?\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Mr. Muslimovic, if I could ask you to move back a little bit\r\nfrom the microphones?  They are quite sensitive and they will be able\r\nto pick up your voice.\r\nToward the latter part of your imprisonment in Omarska, did\r\nyou manage to get into a room in the restaurant and away from room 15?\r\nA.   Yes, yes, I did, but only towards the end of my stay in the camp,\r\ntowards the end of the hell that was taking place there.\r\nQ.   Did you do so because you had been told you were on a liquidation\r\nlist?\r\nA.   Certainly.\r\nQ.   During the time you were in room 15 were prisoners regularly called\r\nout at night from your room?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Did many of them disappear after they were called out?\r\nA.   Many of those who were called out never returned to our room.\r\nQ.   What about those who did return, what was their physical condition?\r\nA.   Walking corpses, wounded, injured.  We cannot describe that, but we\r\ncan just say a wounded man is returning.  We could not see which parts\r\nof the body were wounded, but he was walking like he had just been run\r\nover by a car.\r\nQ.   Were beatings a regular occurrence at Omarska, beatings of prisoners?\r\nA.   Every day.\r\nQ.   When would those things occur?  What would prisoners be doing when\r\nbeatings would happen?\r\nA.   Would you please repeat the question?\r\nQ.   Sure.  Under what circumstances would those beatings take place?\r\nA.   They were called out, taken out and beaten up.  That was mostly late,\r\nin the late afternoon and then on through the night.\r\nQ.   What about during other times when prisoners were going to their meal\r\nor were going to the toilet?\r\nA.   Certainly, when we went to our meals that was the daily event.  If\r\nyou got away without any beating, that was great luck.  When you went\r\nto the toilet, you had to keep from going because you never knew what\r\ncriminal was there at the door. Daily, wherever you went out of the\r\nroom, you expected to be beaten and if you were not beaten, that was\r\njust a piece of luck.\r\nQ.   You referred to going to meals.  What kind of food did prisoners\r\nreceive when they went to meals?\r\nA.   They were given a meal a day, sometimes no meal, and most frequently\r\nthe last inmates did not get anything, the first got something, so\r\nthey returned without having anything.  The meal was the kind that I\r\nwould never serve anybody, not even my greatest enemy I would not\r\nallow to eat that.  That is all.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Your Honour, I am about to move on to a new area.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Today we are going to adjourn at 5 o'clock so we\r\nwill stand in recess though for 20 minutes.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Tieger, would you like to continue, please?\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Yes, your Honour, thank you.  Mr. Muslimovic, did you know\r\nanyone named Dule Tadic before the war?\r\nA.   No.\r\nQ.   While you were in Omarska did other prisoners point out to you a man\r\nthey said was named Dule Tadic?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Had you ever seen that man before Omarska?\r\nA.   No.\r\nQ.   Were you beaten by this man in Omarska?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   On how many occasions?\r\nA.   I had two direct collisions with him.\r\nQ.   In addition to the beatings, did you see him in Omarska at other\r\ntimes?\r\nA.   Yes, several times.\r\nQ.   Where did you see him?\r\nA.   I saw him in front of the kitchen and in front of the white house.\r\nQ.   How many times did you see him by the kitchen?\r\nA.   About two times, I should say, twice, two or three -- twice, that is\r\nsafer.\r\nQ.   Where were you when you saw him by the kitchen?\r\nA.   We were moving towards the kitchen.  We were going for lunch.\r\nQ.   How many times did you see him by the white house?\r\nA.   Also about two times.\r\nQ.   Where were you when you saw him by the white house?\r\nA.   At the window in the room in which I was.\r\nQ.   In May of this year did investigators show you a book of photographs?\r\nA.   Could you repeat the question, please?  I did not hear it.\r\nQ.   Of course.  In May of this year did investigators show you a book of\r\nphotographs?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   At any time before you were shown the book of photographs, had you\r\nseen a picture of the person in camp you knew as Dule Tadic in any\r\nnewspapers or television or from any other source?\r\nA.   No.\r\nQ.   Were you asked to look at the photographs in the book?\r\nA.   I am not getting the interpretation.  I do not hear anything.  Yes.\r\nQ.   OK.  You finally heard the question and you were asked to look at the\r\nphotographs in the book.  Were you asked to see if there was anyone\r\nyou recognised?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Did they tell you whose pictures were in the book?\r\nA.   No.\r\nQ.   Did you look at the photographs in the photo book?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   After looking at the photographs in the photo book had you seen the\r\nphotograph of someone you were sure you recognised from Omarska?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Was that the person who beat you on two occasions and whom you had\r\nbeen told was Dule Tadic?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Did you sign and date the back of the photograph of the person you\r\nrecognised?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   May the witness be shown which should be marked for identification as\r\nExhibit 255?\r\nA.   May I have a look at it?\r\nQ.   Yes, please.\r\nA.   It looks like it.  Yes.\r\nQ.   Is this the book of photographs you were shown, Mr. Muslimovic?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Does your signature and the date appear on the back of the photograph\r\nyou recognised?\r\nA.   I do not know.  I would have to take a look.\r\nQ.   Please do.\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Your Honour, I would tender 255 for admission.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  I understand there is a running objection to the use\r\nof the photospread book.\r\nMR. WLADIMIROFF:   Yes, your Honour.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  We will note that objection.  It will be overruled.\r\nExhibit 255 is admitted.\r\nMR. TIEGER (To the witness):  Mr. Muslimovic, I would like to ask you\r\nabout the first time you were beaten by this man.  Did that occur\r\nafter an interrogation?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Where was the interrogation conducted?\r\nA.   In the room above the kitchen to the right.\r\nQ.   Were you beaten during that interrogation?\r\nA.   Yes, of course and quite a lot.\r\nQ.   When the interrogation was over what path did you take back to your\r\nroom?\r\nA.   The same path that I got there, down the stairs and from the kitchen\r\nto the -- from the white house to the kitchen and then naturally\r\nupstairs to room 15.\r\nQ.   As you walked toward the entrance to the hangar, what happened?\r\nA.   Well, you know, each one of us looked for some comfort and trying to\r\nsee someone, to greet someone, to say \"hello\" to someone.  Each one of\r\nus could be called out and not returned. Each one had his own story to\r\ntell, and I accompanied by blows from the kitchen, blows I received\r\nwith an electric cord, I walked to the corner, what should I call it,\r\na hangar, or a building, the one that is in front of me.  There I was\r\nfor a while let alone.\r\nThe guard went around me and came in front.  Of course, I had\r\nto follow him, but I took a glance.  My head had to be down but I did\r\nsteal a look, and there were about five, six, 10 people in front\r\nthere.  Of course I do not know how many because I did not dare look\r\nfor longer, it was too dangerous, but you were looking for some\r\ncomfort to save your life, then it is not as dangerous.  It is more\r\ndangerous when you know there is no escape.\r\nOf the people who stood there -- there were about five or six\r\nor seven of them, I did not count them -- I recognised Kecema, Dusko,\r\nor perhaps I thought that he could be the one who could perhaps help\r\nme to end as a dead man, but from what I could see he gave no sign of\r\ncoming near me, coming to me, saying, \"How are you?  Where are you?\"\r\nor something.  He was just walking up and down.  When I saw that, I\r\nsimply felt he would not help me.\r\nWhen I was near the door, not quite at the door but near it, I\r\ncast a last look, hoping that that man who I believed might help me,\r\nwould do something, anything, but I could no longer see him.  He was\r\nnot in the line of my eyes, and I only heard a man saying, \"Oh, well,\r\nI know this one.  He has got broad shoulders\" and he started towards\r\nme.  I hurried.\r\nQ.   Where was the group that Dusko Kecema was with?  Can you point it out\r\nwith the long pointer?\r\nA.   (The witness indicated on the model).\r\nQ.   On that grassy area?\r\nA.   Correct.\r\nQ.   You may be seated.  Do you know who he was with at that time or did\r\nyou see any of the people at that point who he was with?\r\nA.   Well, I used to see some of those people, of course.\r\nQ.   After the remark was made by someone that he knew this one who has\r\nbroad shoulders and you hurried toward the hangar, what happened?\r\nA.   I started towards the hangar and I did try to hurry because somehow I\r\ndid feel some danger was imminent and I reached the door, the entrance\r\ndoor to the staircase, not the room, but the staircase and there I\r\nfelt a blow which made me fall down on my hands in the direction of\r\nthe stairs.\r\nQ.   After you fell down in the direction of the stairs, what happened\r\nnext?\r\nA.   I fell on my hands and I remained in that posture.  My hands and my\r\nfeet were on the ground.  I was not lying down exactly, but I was like\r\nthat, and he came from behind my back and got me by my hair and was\r\npushing me left and right, shoving me left and right, and in this\r\ndriving, I do not know what else to call it, I had to lift my hands\r\nand at one point I faced the exit doors from this area where the\r\nstairs were.\r\nQ.   So, after you first fell to your hands and knees, someone came from\r\nbehind you and grabbed you by the hair and pulled you back?\r\nA.   Left and right, up and down, around, as if trying to shake\r\nsomething.  I do not know how to describe it.  He grabbed me by the\r\nhair.  He turned me to the right, to the left but very roughly, very\r\nstrongly.  It was painful, of course.  After that shuffling right and\r\nleft, up and down, I found myself facing the exit door but on my knees\r\nstill.\r\nQ.   You said that he grabbed you by the hair, were you able to see who\r\nhad grabbed you by the hair and did you recognise who that was?\r\nA.   Of course the gentleman on the picture.\r\nQ.   After you found yourself facing the exit door but still on your\r\nknees, what happened next?\r\nA.   At that moment I saw a man holding a beret.  My head was still pulled\r\nback so that I had to watch it, and it was right in front of my eyes\r\n---\r\nTHE INTERPRETER:  Could the witness speak up a little, please?\r\nTHE WITNESS:  -- and the man holding that beret ---\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Muslimovic ---\r\nA.   -- told me to kiss it.\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  -- would you speak up a little bit?  It is very\r\ndifficult to know just how far; we tell you to move forwards and then\r\nwe tell you to move back.  I have the same problem.  But speak up a\r\nbit and if you have a problem, let us know.\r\nTHE WITNESS:  So I was staring at that beret.  There was a badge on it\r\nwhich we all knew.  I did not really try to see the colours and all\r\nthat, but at that moment I saw a Kokarda.  I was ordered to kiss it,\r\nwhich I refused and after a little while, a kick from a person who was\r\nstanding across me and holding this Kokarda hit me, so that simply as\r\nhe hit me I fell against that Kokarda and it cut my lip, and I was\r\nbleeding.  This was  followed by a series of blows up and down, left\r\nand right.  You did not know where they came from.  The important\r\nthing was that you were receiving those blows.\r\nQ.   Do you know the name of the man who had the Kokarda and who kicked\r\nyou?\r\nA.   I do not know his name.  I know his nickname was Saponja, but whether\r\nthat was his real name or a nickname, I do not know.  I do not think\r\nthat Saponja is a name, but I believe it is a nickname.\r\nQ.   After the series of blows following Saponja's kick to your mouth,\r\nwhat was the next thing that happened?\r\nA.   After the blow a series of blows followed and I received a blow in\r\nthe head like this.  I could not see what it was, with what it was,\r\nbut the blow was so strong that I stumbled forward.  I fell to that\r\nposture and I remained there because as I stumbled the most important\r\nthing was to hide one's head because everything else was less painful.\r\nBut there were blows on my arms and everywhere, so that I was trying\r\nto protect my head slightly.  At one point I felt that my arms were\r\nblocked, that somebody was standing on my hands and I could not move\r\neither right or left.  Then a series of blows in the head followed and\r\nthen some object was thrown.  I was not watching it, but I know it\r\nhurt.  Then it came against my back, so one expects it to hit you, but\r\nhow that object reached my back I do not know.  At any rate, I was in\r\nthis posture and there was this object, that thing falling down on me.\r\nQ.   Did you struggle to get away and were you successful?\r\nA.   Well, you know, a whole day of interrogation and beating you could\r\nnot call it interrogation, beating, I really was powerless, but\r\nsomehow I summoned up strength because I thought  it was the end, I\r\nthought I would not get out alive, that that is where my end would\r\nhappen.  As they were still hitting me left and right and everywhere,\r\nsomehow I managed to pull my hands...hands free and in this fury I\r\nmanaged to run up the stairs. I did it.  I did it.  I managed to get\r\naway and reach, I cannot understand how, but I did manage to reach the\r\ntop of the stairs where there was a guard with a rifle aimed at me. I\r\ndid not care any longer whether he would fire, perhaps it would have\r\nbeen easier.  I simply pushed him away.  At that moment I felt that it\r\nwould be much easier for me if he fired because if I went back it\r\nwould be the same.  As it was I thought it would hurt less.  So the\r\ndoor was open, well, I cannot say it was unlocked, neither it was\r\nclosed, I think the door was ajar.  So, as I was thrusting forward, as\r\nI pushed him away I just got into the room, and that must have been\r\nsome divine force, I do not know what it was, I cannot describe it. At\r\nany rate, I entered and I felt safer.  What did it mean \"safer\"?  But\r\nI was among other people.  I was not alone.  If anything was going to\r\nhappen then I was not alone.  I was with them.  I do not know how.  I\r\nwas not moving normally, walking normally, but at the entrance I was\r\npassing through the door and I received another strong blow in the\r\nback.  So that, I do not know how to put it, I stumbled, I staggered\r\nand I then staggered on to this area, to this room, where I used to\r\nsleep, where on one hand there were the shower booths and on the other\r\nside a trough, a concrete trough, and I somehow managed to get in and\r\nthat is where I fell down.\r\nQ.   Did anyone follow you into the room?\r\nA.   From that moment when I was walking, while I was still moving, I did\r\nnot know that, but as I fell by the trough I heard  a bullet and I\r\nthought it was the bullet intended for me.  That is how it sounded,\r\nechoing, \"Nobody approach me, I will kill anyone who comes close\", and\r\nthen I realised he was in, that he was in that room where we were.  I\r\nheard, \"Don't move, don't turn around, I will kill anyone who moves.\"\r\nThen the voices were getting further and furtherer away.  It was not\r\nas loud as when they were next to me, as the first moment it appeared,\r\nas sounding as if it was right next to me, and the door closed. I\r\ntried to stand up, to straighten up by this trough because that was\r\nnot the place where I used to be before.  I did straighten up but I\r\nfell down again.  As far as I can remember, it was Mr. Alic, I believe\r\nit was Mirso Alic, I am not absolutely sure but I think it was him, he\r\ncame to me and how I reached the place where I used to be before I do\r\nnot know, from the trough to my usual place.  I do not know.  I know I\r\nfell down and when I came to I realised I was in my place.\r\nQ.   You mentioned that you heard a bullet.  Is that the sound of a bullet\r\nbeing fired or a bullet being chambered?\r\nA.   No.  I heard a regular being chambered, a rifle uncocked. Perhaps I\r\nsaid a bullet, but what I heard was a rifle being cocked.  Well, I\r\nguess the sound was very loud.  It sounded very loud.  It sounded as\r\nif it was right by my ear that sound.\r\nQ.   Approximately how long after this first beating did the second\r\nbeating involving the man you knew as Dule occur?\r\nA.   It is very difficult to speak about time, but I think it must have\r\nbeen a week, not more than that, perhaps a day or two more or less,\r\nbut about a week.\r\nQ.   Were you in room 15 that day?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   About what time of the day did the incident occur?\r\nA.   It happened late in the afternoon.  It was still light, but I did not\r\nhave a watch.  I do not know the date.  It was impossible to remember.\r\nI could not be bothered really. I simply did not want to think, but\r\nit was late in the afternoon and it was still daylight.\r\nQ.   Was a prisoner called out from your room?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Who was that?\r\nA.   Emir Beganovic.\r\nQ.   After Emir Beganovic was called out could you hear the sounds of a\r\nbeating coming from downstairs?\r\nA.   Sounds reached that area where I was, but not so loudly, not as if it\r\nwas in the next room or in my room.  They came from the outside.  One\r\ncould hear them.\r\nQ.   Sometime after that were you called out?\r\nA.   True.\r\nQ.   Where was the voice that was calling you out coming from?\r\nA.   From the entrance door.\r\nQ.   Did you leave the room and did you get up and go toward the entrance\r\ndoor?\r\nA.   Not the first time, but the second time when the same voice came I\r\nhad to.\r\nQ.   Was there a Serb soldier outside the door when you left the room?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Was there another Serb waiting for you down the stairs?\r\nA.   Yes.\r\nQ.   Where was that person?\r\nA.   That man was stood at the bottom of the stairs, perhaps a metre, half\r\na metre.  Generally speaking, he was standing by the  stairs.\r\nQ.   What was that person wearing?\r\nA.   All I remember is the white belt, the white belt and military uniform\r\nnaturally, but this white belt stuck in my mind.\r\nQ.   Did you go downstairs?\r\nA.   Of course.\r\nQ.   Did the man with the white belt stop you or let you pass initially?\r\nA.   No, at that moment when I came near him he let me pass by and stayed\r\nbehind my back.\r\nQ.   What happened next?\r\nA.   I turned right, it was two or three steps, so I started and there was\r\na man with a rifle who said, \"No, no, there\", and immediately a blow\r\nfrom the back followed and then so on and so forth, I was accompanied\r\nby blows.  From the left and from the right, I did not know where they\r\nwere coming from.  You had to cover your head to protect yourself, so\r\nyou protected yourself up there and then they hit you below.  So there\r\nwere blows from the entrance door.\r\nTHE INTERPRETER:  Could the witness please speak up or come closer to the\r\nmicrophone?  We barely here him.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Mr. Muslimovic, I will ask you to move your chair a little\r\ncloser to the microphone again, if you do not mind.  Were you hit or\r\npushed toward the hangar?\r\nA.   I was a bit struck.  The strongest ones were in the back and those\r\nwere the ones who pushed me.  That was from the left, from the right\r\nand then one from the back, so that I had to stagger forward.  That is\r\nhow the blows directed me to this door, not towards the exit but\r\ntowards the interior.\r\nQ.   When you got to the interior part of the hangar, that is the hangar\r\nfloor, what happened?\r\nA.   I did not enter, that is putting it very mildly.  Under those blows\r\nthere was force which directed me that way.  Then came questions, not\r\nquestions but orders, \"Take off your jacket\", so I took off my jacket\r\nwhich was of a coffee colour. I gave it to the person who had met me\r\nat the stairs and, of course, he began to search through it, to frisk\r\nit.  It was not much, but he began to look there and he was cursing\r\nand saying, \"Where's your money?\" and curses and filthy language.  I\r\nwas not thinking much about that.  I was wondering whether they would\r\nhit me again.  I felt and I saw this jacket.  It was low and my head\r\nwas down, but I was trying to look like this, and I felt how this\r\njacket was thrown away as if behind the back. There was nothing in it\r\nfor sure.  Then questions ensued, \"Where's your money? What kind of a\r\nmortar do you have?\" and things like that.  I mean such provocative\r\nquestions that you just look at him, I mean, you know, someone asks\r\nyou, \"Where's your tank?\"  I mean you cannot hide a tank.  It was like\r\nthat. It was so incredible.  If he had asked me some normal questions\r\nperhaps I might have thought about them, but the questions were such\r\nthat there was nothing you could reply.  So you just kept silent and\r\nquestion was accompanied, was followed by a blow.\r\nQ.   Was there a group of Serbs there at that time?\r\nA.   Of course.  Not in a group, but when you are hit and your head goes\r\nright or left or up and down and every time it moves you are bound to\r\nsee somebody.  They were all over, in front and behind and to the\r\nleft, because whenever he hit you you could not keep your posture, you\r\nchanged simply the posture.  Whenever you looked they were there.\r\nQ.   What were they beating you with, what sorts of objects?\r\nA.   Rifles, electrical cords, soldiers' boots which was very, very heavy,\r\nperhaps heavier than the gun, a baseball bat.  This is what I could\r\nsee and feel on my back.\r\nQ.   At some point did you end up held against a dumper tyre?\r\nA.   Yes, true.\r\nQ.   How did that happen?\r\nA.   After this series of blows which followed, mostly from the gentleman\r\nwith white slings and white belt, and others too of course but more\r\noften than not from that gentleman, I could not see anything.  You\r\nhear, but you just do not see.  All is dark, all is black.  I do not\r\nknow what to call it, but at that moment I did not see anything\r\nregardless of whether I had my eyes open or not.  I heard again a\r\nnoise, shouts, but I could not understand, I could not distinguish.\r\nWhen I realised that I was able to see something around me, I was\r\nalready straightened up and I could not fall down because my arms were\r\nin that position and fixed.  So I assumed I had been tied because it\r\nwas impossible for a man to stand like that.  My head was bent down.\r\nAs the seconds were passing by I was recovering my consciousness more\r\nand more and I realised that I was tied to a tyre which was bigger\r\nthan I.  I did not turn to see what kind of a tyre it was.  I could\r\nnot.  One could see while hit that it was a tyre.\r\nQ.   What happened after you were held against that tyre?\r\nA.   Well, it was always accompanied by blows, a series of blows and\r\nnoise, curses, always swearing at mother, at religion, and they were\r\npractising blows.  I was just a bat they used to practise blows.  They\r\npractised them until I lost consciousness again.\r\nQ.   What kind of blows did they practise?\r\nA.   They were mostly blows, how shall I say, I do not know how to put it.\r\nMost of the blows were with the foot, mostly with a foot.  Naturally\r\nsome came with a rifle or some with a bat, but they were mostly kicks\r\nwith the foot, from the right and from left, and they hurt most here\r\nfrom the chin downward.  Those were the kicks that I felt best.\r\nEverything else somehow I could endure easier than those kicks.\r\nQ.   Were the kicks from any particular person the strongest?\r\nA.   Must be because those were the ones that I felt most and that they\r\nhurt most.  I thought somehow when he hit me here I felt them in the\r\nback, as if they went right through.  If somebody came with a rifle,\r\nthat was fine with me.  That was really very nice for me as compared\r\nwith that kick.  I mean, the word \"fine\" is not perhaps the best word,\r\nbut I somehow felt easier when hit with the rifle or anything else\r\nthan that.\r\nQ.   Who was it whose kicks were the strongest and most effective?\r\nA.   The gentleman whom I recognised in the picture.\r\nMR. TIEGER:  Should I continue your Honour?\r\nTHE PRESIDING JUDGE:  We will adjourn until Tuesday at 10.30. We will\r\nbegin at 10.30 on Tuesday instead of 10 o'clock.\r\n(The court adjourned until Tuesday, 23rd July 1996)\r\n"},{"_id":"6389c32897ad59b4cfc560ba","name":"ECCC_E1_41.1_TR001_20090701_Final_EN_Pub.txt","plainText":"P R O C E E D I N G S\r\n(Judges enter courtroom)\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nPlease be seated.  The Court is now in session.\r\nAccording to our schedule, today we're going to hear the\r\ntestimony of another survivor; the third person among the nine\r\nsurvivors of S-21.\r\nThe lawyer, I note your presence.  Would you like to make any\r\ncomments?\r\nMS. STUDZINSKY:\r\nMr. President, good morning.  Your Honours, good morning, dear\r\ncolleagues.\r\nYes, I would like to make some observations and also I'm seeking\r\nfor clarification before we hear the next survivor.\r\nWe have observed that Mr. Chum Mey yesterday was overwhelmed\r\nsometimes when he accounted his story and he had to cry, and he\r\ncould not control his emotions any more.  He shares his\r\ntraumatization as well as the next survivor, who is my client\r\ntogether with Cambodian colleagues, and he shares this situation\r\nwith other survivors, victims, civil parties and witnesses.\r\nI would like to make a proposal.  I would like that the Chamber\r\ngives information to the witness at the beginning that if they\r\nneed time to cope with their emotions when they are moved, that\r\nthey get this time, that they can be sure to have this time\r\nbefore they continue with their testimony; and as well to offer\r\nthem, in the case that they continue, that they can ask to\r\nrecover and have a short break.\r\nAnd, as well, to offer them again that they can contact, even\r\nduring their testimony if they feel it is necessary, with TPO,\r\nwhich is the psychological support organization, to recover and\r\nto come back.  And I think we all can benefit and for the\r\nwitnesses, civil parties, victims, who will testify in Court, it\r\nis then clear that they can have this time which they find --\r\nwhich is necessary before they are able again to speak and tell\r\ntheir story.  I'm seeking then for a clarification.\r\nI would like to have the following information from the Chamber\r\nto make it clear that from our time that we have, and I think for\r\nall parties, the 30 or 40 minutes that we have, that this time\r\ncounts only for the interrogation of any witnesses or civil\r\nparties or experts, and that outside events like, for example, a\r\nwitness cries and is overwhelmed and moved by his or her emotions\r\nand traumatism, then this time is subtracted from our time that\r\nwe have.\r\nAnd the same for other events like, for example, discussion of\r\nany legal issues or whatever is not directly a part of our\r\ninterrogation because, if not, we are feeling very much under\r\npressure and I think this is only my perspective, seeking a\r\nclarification from the Chamber so that we know this time is for\r\ninterrogation time.\r\nThese are my observations and I would appreciate if the Chamber\r\ncould make this clarification that would facilitate our standing\r\nhere in Court and, of course, the questioning of the civil party\r\ntoday and other civil parties and witnesses.\r\nAnd I also would like to inform the Chamber that the civil party\r\ntoday is somehow very strong but is, at some points of his story,\r\nvery weak and will be moved very much by his emotions and, of\r\ncourse, willing to testify here before this Court and very happy\r\nto do this.  But I think this time should be granted that he is\r\nmore relaxed and able then to come back to the situation where he\r\ncan talk and really willing to talk.\r\nThank you very much for your attention.\r\nMR. WERNER:\r\nMr. President, just to inform you that Ms. Studzinsky spoke on\r\nbehalf of our group as well.  Thank you.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nThank you, the lawyers, for making those remarks.\r\nThe Chamber has already determined -- and we also have the\r\nimpression that we are prepared concerning the matters raised --\r\nand the Chamber has already indicated the times allotted for the\r\ncivil party lawyers.  However, we have also taken into account\r\nthe other objections and other times interfere during the time\r\nwhen the civil parties are putting questions to the witness or\r\nthe accused.\r\nSo the time is calculated based on the time when the civil\r\nparties are putting the questions, so the Judges are monitoring\r\nand observing the proceedings, and we will see if there is any\r\ntime used other than the times used by the civil parties during\r\nthe given time.  Then the Chamber would like to give extra time\r\nto them.  So we would be flexible accordingly.\r\nThe starting time of the session can be flexible also, depending\r\non something that happens practically in the Court, and yesterday\r\nwe had some problems because the witness was very emotional while\r\nhe was being asked by the prosecutor, and the prosecutors have\r\nnot used all the times given to them, and for the civil parties\r\nwe have observed that they have not used up all the times\r\nallocated to them.\r\nThe calculation of the times for the civil parties are\r\nappropriate.  It doesn't mean that the calculation is based on a\r\nfew questions the civil parties would put to the witness or to\r\nthe accused, but it's based on the proportion.\r\nRegarding the survivors of the regime, we note that they have\r\nbeen very emotional and yesterday, after having examined how we\r\ncould control the witness when he or she is very emotional and we\r\nalso checked to see whether there are doctors or psychiatrists on\r\nstandby, then the Court would seek their assistance to help that\r\nwitness before we proceeded further.\r\nHowever, after a few moments, we observed that the witness could\r\nrecompose himself and that he was under control to respond to\r\nfurther questions.  Of course, the Trial Chamber is taking into\r\nconsideration these matters seriously.\r\nAnd the civil parties, the lawyers representing the parties, are\r\nalso to be vigilant.  I mean they should be vigilant when they\r\nnotice that their clients need such assistance.  Then they can\r\nremind the Chamber, but I think probably it would not be\r\nappropriate if the civil party lawyer asked for like a half-day\r\nbreak for a witness to recompose him or herself.  Then it would\r\nbe a long break for him, which could also affect the schedule of\r\nthe hearing.\r\nWe believe that the psychiatrists have already been employed to\r\nassist the clients or the witnesses, and they are ready to be of\r\nany assistance when needed.  So we do not really intend to really\r\nincite the emotions of the witnesses until he or she cries, so\r\nemotionally that it could even affect his mental fitness and, of\r\ncourse, the Chamber is well informed of this.\r\nTo sum up, the Trial Chamber is very deliberate when it comes to\r\nthe calculation of times allocated to parties, however, the times\r\nfor objections have not been included in the allocated times to\r\nthe parties.  So the parties could still exercise their full\r\nrights to use the full time allocated to them, except the\r\nobjections or any matter that arises during such proceedings.\r\nWe, as human beings, are cautious and we really take the concerns\r\nor remarks raised by the civil parties, and we really appreciate\r\nthe civil parties to raise these before the Chamber so that we\r\ncan take immediate action to make sure that the witness can be\r\nunder his control of emotions.  Of course, if the Chamber noted\r\nthat the witness is under control of his feelings, then we could\r\nproceed further without any other suggestions from the civil\r\nparties' lawyers for the clients.\r\nThe Court officer, you are now instructed to bring the survivor,\r\nMr. Bou Meng, into the courtroom.\r\n(Witness enters courtroom)\r\nQUESTIONING BY THE BENCH\r\nBY MR. PRESIDENT:\r\nQ. What is your name, Uncle?\r\nA. My name is Bou Meng.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nYou can sit down, no problem, because we will take the full day\r\nto hear your testimony, so you are allowed to be seated.\r\nBefore you respond to any questions, could you please wait until\r\nyou see the red light on the mic.  If you speak when the light is\r\nnot on, your message would not be interpreted and the\r\ninternational colleagues in the proceedings and the public\r\ngallery would not hear what you are saying.\r\nAnd, number three, according to the note of the Greffier, you\r\nseem to have a hearing problem.  So the Chamber would like to\r\ninform you that when you listen to any question and that you\r\nunderstand the question, you should be quiet and wait until the\r\nred light on.  Then you can respond.  If you are not able to\r\nunderstand the questions, then you can make a request to the\r\nparty who puts such question to rephrase or to ask you again\r\nbefore you can respond.\r\nBY MR. PRESIDENT:\r\nQ. How old are you?\r\nA. I'm 68 years old this year.\r\nQ. Where do you live now?\r\nA. I live in Kampong Kong Commune, Kaoh Thum district, Kandal\r\nprovince.\r\nQ. What is your occupation?\r\nA. Since I have been detained at Tuol Sleng, I had hearing\r\nproblems.  My eyesights are not good and I am physically weak.\r\nQ. Could you please be reminded that you should wait until you\r\nsee the red light before you can respond, otherwise your message\r\nwould not be communicated.  Please wait, Uncle.\r\nAre you married?\r\nA. I have another wife.\r\nQ. What is her name?\r\nA. She is 48 years.\r\n(Microphones not activated)\r\nA. My ex-wife was Ma Yoeun, alias Thy.  She died during the Pol\r\nPot regime.\r\nQ.  You have filed a civil party application to join as a civil\r\nparty.  Now, before the Chamber, what is actually the purpose of\r\nyour application?  Would you like to seek reparation on your\r\nbehalf or you would like your lawyers to act on your behalf?\r\nA. I would like to allow my civil party lawyers to act on my\r\nbehalf regarding these reparations.\r\nQ. After having decided to join as a civil party, what is your\r\ninvolvement in the facts regarding the accused in this case?\r\nA. Mr. President, I'm not really sure whether I understand your\r\nquestion.  Could you please make it in a more simplified Khmer\r\nlanguage?\r\nQ. The Chamber would like to ask you that you have already joined\r\nas a civil party, but we would like to know of your involvement\r\ninto any particular fact; for example, the fact of S-21 or the\r\nfact of S-24, Prey Sar.\r\nAnd, number two, have you been the direct of victim of the fact\r\nor you are here on behalf of your loved ones who were victims of\r\nS-21 or S-24, or you were here as the victim of both facts?\r\nA. Mr. President, I am here to be on behalf of myself who is the\r\nvictim of the regime because I had been beaten severely and my\r\nwife disappeared, and I don't know where she has gone or how she\r\nwould have been tortured.\r\nQ. Before the 17th of April 1975, where did you live and what was\r\nyour occupation back then?\r\nA. I went into the maquis jungle to liberate the territory and to\r\nsave King Norodom Sihanouk.\r\nQ. Could you please tell the Court about your experience and what\r\nyou have come across during the Khmer Rouge regime after the 17th\r\nof April 1975 until the 7th of January 1979?\r\nA. After the 17th April 1975, I was ordered by Angkar to work in\r\nthe technical school in Ruessei Keo.  I did the drawing and the\r\nsketches for the workshop participants.  It was at the technical\r\nschool in Ruessei Keo.\r\nQ. You can just continue to describe your accounts from the time\r\nthat you were at the Ruessei Keo Technical School until you were\r\nfree from the Tuol Sleng on the 7th of January 1979.  If you can,\r\ndescribe all those accounts.\r\nIf you can not, then the Chamber would put some questions to you\r\nbased on the certain periods of the events.\r\nA. Mr. President, during the times that I served at the Ruessei\r\nKeo Technical School, I had worked for about one year; I cannot\r\nrecall exactly.  My apology if I cannot recall the exact date due\r\nto the serious torture that I received.  So my memory is not in\r\ngreat shape.\r\nIn 1976, Angkar arrested my superior, Hak, from the Ruessei Keo\r\nTechnical School.  Two or three months later, the Southwest Group\r\ncame to take control of that school.  I was then transferred to\r\nTa Lei Co-operative in Dangkao Commune, Dangkao district, Dangkao\r\nprovince.  It was the co-operative with the education site.\r\nAt that time, I was forced by Angkar to dig canals from Ta Lei\r\nvillage to the Prey Sar prison.  I was forced to build dams, to\r\ndig canals actively, so I was so severely physically used to\r\nprovide the labour to Angkar.  It was to the limit of my physical\r\nstance to do that labour.\r\nLater on, Angkar ordered me to the group of adult people to make\r\nploughs and some other wooden tools, rakes, and the chief of the\r\ngroup was Pak.  We called him Brother Pak.  It was still at the\r\nTa Lei Co-operative.\r\nAnd later on, I was assigned to plant vegetables, and while I was\r\nworking the soil at the vegetable beds, I grew cabbage, and over\r\nthere we use human fertilizer.  It was called fertilizer number\r\none.\r\nAnd one day, there was a group of people in black clothes.  I\r\nthink they were driving a Jeep, if I can recall correctly.  At\r\nthat time, I was planting eggplants.  I was told by that group\r\nthat Angkar required me and my wife to prepare my belonging in\r\norder to teach the children at the school of fine arts.\r\nBy hearing that, I thought that would be right because it's my\r\nexpertise.  So I was happy, very happy, and I thought that I\r\nwould now work in my right profession.  However, unfortunately,\r\nat that time when I was in the car with my wife in that Jeep, I\r\nwas taken to a location near Kirirom location and I thought that\r\nwas not the way to the school of fine arts.\r\nI felt uneased and I felt a bit scared and I felt I was dizzy.\r\nFor about a half-an-hour later, we reached a location which was\r\nunknown to me at the time and the chief stopped there.  And we\r\nentered a house which was near by the Tuol Sleng prison or the\r\nS-21 Office.  There was a house opposite that office.\r\nThey had two rows of chairs and we were asked to get off the car\r\nand we went to sit on the chairs.  Then there was a person who\r\nordered me to put my hands behind my back, so my wife and I put\r\nour hands behind our backs and they cuffed our hands.\r\nThen my wife started crying and said, \"What do I do wrong?  We\r\nboth are orphans.\"  I was so pitiful of my wife.  At that time,\r\nthey used a piece of black cloth to blindfold both of us, my wife\r\nand I.  Then we were walked into the S-21 Security Office or Tuol\r\nSleng prison.  Then I realized that was a prison.  From then\r\nonward, I was asked to enter a room and I was photographed.\r\nAfter they photographed my wife, then they photographed me, and\r\nthat was the only photograph of my wife that I have had with me\r\nuntil today because I lost all the photos from the 7th of January\r\n1979.  And with me I only have a photo of my wife that I would\r\nlike to show to the judges.\r\nAfter we were photographed, we were walked to Building C and from\r\nthat time onward, I separated from my wife.  I did not know which\r\nbuilding she was taken to.\r\nSo I was placed in the common room on the upper floor.  I think\r\nabout five months or one year later, I received torture.  First,\r\nI was threatened that they would peel my skin.  I didn't know\r\nwhat it means by that, but a person who slept next to me told me\r\nthat it means that you will be beaten during the interrogation\r\nand I felt so horrified in my mind.  I was so shocked.  I\r\nthought, what mistake did I make?  I tried my best to serve\r\nAngkar.  And in the end, I became and fell into such a situation\r\nso I kept thinking.\r\nWhile I was in the prison, all the clothes were stripped off\r\nexcept my underwear.  So I slept directly on the floor for\r\nseveral months.\r\nThen they started to interrogate me and beat me up.  It was --\r\nthe interrogation location was in a house outside the compound.\r\nIt was behind the Building A.  They cut me and they asked me to\r\nlie down on the floor with my face facing down and they had a\r\nbunch of sticks and they dropped it on the floor and it made\r\nnoise.  And I was asked to choose which stick I preferred.  And I\r\nresponded, \"Whichever stick I choose, it is still a stick that\r\nyou will use to beat me up so it is up to you, Brother, to decide\r\nwhich one you want to use.\"\r\nMam Nai stood up and grabbed a stick and started to beat me up.\r\nAfter he felt exhausted, then another person came to take turn to\r\nbeat me up.  So that Mam Nai was Mam Nai alias Chan.  He got his\r\nskin condition with a spotty skins and quite a red in his face.\r\nHe asked me to count the lashes and when I counted up to 10\r\nlashes, he said, \"How come you count to 10 lashes?  I only beat\r\nyou for one lash.\"\r\nI was -- I felt so painful at the time.  There were wounds --\r\nmany wounds on my back and the blood was on the floor flowing\r\nfrom my back.  Whips were also used to torture me.  I was so\r\nshocked and painful.\r\nEvery time they beat me up, they asked me questions; when did I\r\njoin the CIA and, \"Who introduced you into the CIA network and\r\nwhat was their name?\"  And I responded that I did not know.  So\r\nthe first beating, I responded I did not know.  The second time\r\nof the beating, the third times; I gave the same response.  Even\r\nif my back had wound, they beat on that wound.  It was so painful\r\nand I could not think of any mistake that I made.  I did not know\r\nwhat CIA or KGB network was; then how could I respond?  So they\r\njust kept beating me up.  I had a lot of scars on my back as\r\nevidence from that torture.\r\nIn my mind, I thought of my mother; that if I could live, I would\r\npray.  Probably it's because of my mother that gave me birth.\r\nAnd I would -- and I thought that if I could lived to give my\r\nstory to the Chamber and now, finally, I am before the ECCC and\r\nthat the ECCC would  find justice for me.  And I feel so happy\r\neven if 100 percent of justice cannot be provided by the Chamber,\r\n50 or 60 percent of justice to me is fine because I determined\r\nfrom the prison where I was detained that I had not committed any\r\nmistake or offence and that I prayed just to be survived.\r\nQ. Uncle Meng, please try to recompose yourself so that you would\r\nhave the\r\nopportunity to tell your story.\r\nAs you have stated, you have been waiting for this opportunity to\r\ntell your accounts, your experience and the sufferings that you\r\nreceived from those unjust acts; from the torture committed by\r\nthe Khmer Rouge, as well as the ill treatment on your wife.  So\r\nplease try to be strong, recompose yourself so that you are in a\r\nbetter position to recount what they did on you so that the\r\npublic and the Chamber who are participating in this proceeding\r\nor the Cambodian people as a whole as well as the international\r\ncommunity to hear, to understand the acts committed by the Khmer\r\nRouge clique on you and that they would express the pityness on\r\nyou as you received those ill treatment from them.  So do not let\r\nyour emotion overwhelm you.  So try to grab the opportunity to\r\ntell your accounts to the Chamber as well as to the public.\r\nUncle Meng, do you understand what I said?\r\nA. Yes, Mr. President; I understand.\r\nQ. Please try to recompose and be strong.  Today is the\r\nopportunity for you to reveal, to describe your sufferings to the\r\nChamber so that the Chamber can understand.  If your emotion\r\noverwhelms you, then it's unlikely that we have another time to\r\nhear your account because the Chamber has scheduled other\r\nwitnesses to provide the testimonies and they had gone through\r\nsimilar experiences, either at S-21 or Prey Sar -- although some\r\nof them are not the direct victims but they're relatives or\r\nfamily members, wives, husbands, parents -- received the unjust\r\nacts over there.\r\nSo, in summary, please continue to recount the experience and the\r\nsufferings that you received from those unjust acts during the\r\ntime that you were detained until the day you were free from that\r\nprison, thanks to the National United Front for Salvation armies\r\non the 7 January '79.  Do you understand what I said?\r\nA. Yes, I can continue, Mr. President.\r\nLet me go back a little bit because I forgot to talk about the\r\nfood ration in the common room.  In that common room, there were\r\nabout 30 or 40 of us and at one corner I saw foreigners with\r\nlight complexions and they were detained there as well, and they\r\nreceived the same food ration; that is, very thin gruel.  There\r\nwas no rice grain in there, just one (inaudible) or one there,\r\nand I was so skinny I had no strength.  Even if I had a stick, I\r\nwould not be able to use it to attack them.\r\nWhen Him Huy took me to the upper floor, he rode on my neck, on\r\nmy shoulder, and I stumbled on the stairs and my knee was hurt\r\nand there was a wound on my knee.  So when I think of those\r\nevents, I felt so painful.\r\nEach day when they took me for interrogation they took me twice,\r\nfrom 7 to 12 in the morning, and in the afternoon from 2 to\r\nor \r\n \r\n          6\r\np.m.  The interrogators who beat me up, I could recognize their            7   faces because when they talked to each other, I recognized their\r\nnames.\r\nThey were Brother Mam Nai, Comrade Hor, Comrade Huy, Comrade Tith\r\nand Peng, so there were five of them altogether.  My apology that\r\nI went back to describe this account because I forgot.\r\nQ. As I told you, please try to re-compose yourself.  This is the\r\nday that you have been waiting for for so long.  I know you are\r\nvery emotional now and probably you will miss certain events that\r\nyou would want to recount.  Of course, the sufferings you and\r\nyour wife received were indescribable and right now the Chamber\r\nwould like to ask you some questions.\r\nWhen there was a vehicle going to pick you up from the Ta Lei\r\nCo-operative in Dangkao district to the School of Fine Arts, were\r\nyou tied or cuffed, and what about your wife?\r\nA. Mr. President, Your Honours, at that time I saw a vehicle but\r\nthere were no cuffs in there.  We were asked to pack our clothes,\r\nso I had some clothes so I put them in my backpack and they were\r\nall taken away at Tuol Sleng.\r\nQ. When they took you to Tuol Sleng, did they take you to Tuol\r\nSleng straight away or were you taken to another place first?\r\nFor example, like the place that you described where there were\r\ntwo rows of chairs.  Was it within the compound of the Tuol Sleng\r\nprison?\r\nA. It was outside the Tuol Sleng prison.  It was opposite the\r\nTuol Sleng prison.  There was a house and there were two rows of\r\nchairs, and in the middle there was a long table.  So we were\r\nasked to enter that house and they ordered us to put our hands\r\nbehind us and then they cuffed our hands, both of us.\r\nQ. When they ordered you to put your hands behind your back and\r\nthen later you were cuffed, did they tell you the reasons for the\r\narrest of your wife and yourself?  Did they tell you the reasons?\r\nA. Mr. President, at that time they did not tell us any reasons\r\nor any mistakes we made, and I and my wife asked them what\r\nmistake did we do and we told them that we were orphans and what\r\nmistakes we did?  And they replied, \"You, the contemptible, you\r\ndon't have to ask.  Angkar has many eyes, like pineapples, and\r\nAngkar only arrests those who make mistakes or offence.\"  And I\r\nwas still wondering what mistakes I did, and my wife wondered the\r\nsame.\r\nAt that time. I was in the adult group in the co-operative to\r\nmake ploughs and rakes, and my wife worked in the rice fields and\r\nI could not think of any mistake that my wife and I made.  Until\r\ntoday, I could not think of the mistakes that I made at the time.\r\nQ. The people who ordered you to put your hands behind your backs\r\nand then they cuffed you and your wife, were they the same people\r\nwho went to pick you up from Ta Lei Co-operative?\r\nA. Mr. President, they were different people.  They were not\r\nthose who took me, who brought me from the co-operative.  They\r\nwere there waiting for us in that room.  So once we entered the\r\nhouse we were asked to sit, in a nice gesture, and later on what\r\nhappened I already described to you.\r\nSo I broke into my tears because I did not know what offence I\r\ncommitted.  If I stay home and did nothing, maybe I made a\r\nmistake, but I did not do that and I cannot think of the mistake\r\nI committed.  Whatever I was asked by Angkar, I just did.\r\nQ. Can you recall the day that you were arrested and taken to\r\nTuol Sleng prison or can you recall the year?\r\nA. Mr. President, I can remember the year.  It was 1977 when I\r\nwas entered into the S-21 Office.  I am a bit weak on the month\r\nbecause at that time there was no calendar to see, so it's only\r\njust based on the thinking or estimation.  I think it could be in\r\nMay or June in 1977.\r\nThe reason why I thought it was in May or June because after they\r\ntortured me and they were fed-up with torturing me, there was a\r\nteenager about 16 or 17 years old made an announcement.  He said,\r\n\"In this room, who can do the painting?\"  So I raised my hand.  I\r\nsaid, yes, I can do the painting.\r\nAnd that person ordered another person to unshackle me and they\r\nthen put a chain on one of my feet.  I was then walked from the\r\nupper floor of that C Building to the ground floor in order to\r\nmeet Mr. Duch.  The reason I recognized him because when I was\r\npainting the portrait of Pol Pot, he was sitting nearby me,\r\nwatching me, sitting on a chair with his legs crossed.  I did a\r\nlot of portraits, not only just for Pol Pot, I also did a\r\nportrait for Mao Zhedong.\r\nQ. The Chamber asked you to describe about the situation but you\r\nhave not been able to detail what we asked you, so I would like\r\nyou to please listen to the question of the Chamber step-by-step\r\nuntil the 7th of January 1979.\r\nI think would you please wait until the question is referred to a\r\nparticular section that you can respond otherwise you would not\r\nbe able to recall the consequential event.  So could you please\r\nbe waiting for the question from the Chamber before you could\r\nrespond to them?\r\nWhen you were arrested and sent to S-21, were you sent in at\r\nnight or in the daytime?\r\nA. It was at about 9 or 10, I can't remember it well, and when I\r\nreached Tuol Sleng there was no clock that I could check the\r\ntime, but it was during the daytime not at night.\r\nQ. When you were handcuffed all together with your wife and\r\nwalked into Tuol Sleng compound, were you both blindfolded?\r\nA. We were blindfolded before we were walked into Tuol Sleng\r\ncompound.\r\nQ. You stated earlier that when you entered the location you were\r\ntaken photograph.  Before the photos were taken, did they ask you\r\nfor your biography or was it done later after the photography?\r\nA. I don't remember all.  Please accept my apologies.\r\nI think the document from Tuol Sleng still survives and the\r\nperson who kept the record was Ti (phonetic), and I was shocked\r\nand confused because I did not know why I was arrested and I did\r\nnot know how I responded to them.  I did not know whether my\r\nbiography would have been sent to them earlier, prior to my\r\narrest.  I'm not sure.\r\nQ. You said your wife and yourself were blindfolded.  Were you\r\nstill being blindfolded while being taken photograph or were the\r\nblindfolds removed?\r\nA. When we were at the photo workshop then our blindfolds were\r\nremoved, and we were seated and I was taken photograph and\r\nfollowed by my wife.\r\nQ. What about the handcuffs?  Were you removed from the handcuffs\r\nwhile being photographed?\r\nA. I don't recall having been removed from the handcuffs.  I'm\r\nnot sure; I forget it.  Maybe the handcuffs were removed or maybe\r\nthey were not.  But so far as I remember after our photographs\r\nwere taken, then we were blindfolded again before we were walked\r\nto Building C.\r\nQ. You said you were stripped to your underwear.  When was that,\r\nbefore you were sent to Building C or only after you got to\r\nBuilding C that your clothes were stripped off?\r\nA. I think maybe my clothes were stripped off downstairs before\r\nwe were walked upstairs or maybe only when we reached upstairs\r\nthat our clothes were stripped off.  I seem to forget.  But as I\r\nremember, it is sure that after we were taken photographs then we\r\nwere re-blindfolded and I did not know where my wife would be\r\nwalked to.\r\nQ. When you reached the building, it was the common building for\r\nall prisoners or it was a separate prison cell for detaining you\r\nalone?\r\nA. Mr. President, at that time I was put in a common large room\r\nin which about 20 to 30 detainees were placed.  They all looked\r\nlike hell because their hairs grew long, even they were male but\r\ntheir hairs grew so long.  I felt dizzy when I entered the room\r\nand I was so confused.\r\nQ. When you were being handcuffed, were you handcuffed and\r\nattached to the bar, the metal bar with the other detainees, or\r\nyou were handcuffed and then isolated?  Could you please tell us\r\nabout the condition of the shackles?\r\nA. We were put into the common rooms and in each metal bar\r\nresembled the shackles.  There were a lot of detainees attached\r\nto the shackles by our ankles, maybe five to 10 people for each\r\nlong shackles and we were put to sleep head to head with other\r\ndetainees, so my head was put against the east wall.\r\nQ. At that time could you sit up when your both legs were\r\nshackled to the long bar like that?\r\nA. I could sit up but we had to ask permission from the guards\r\nbefore we could relieve ourselves, although we were given an\r\nammunitions box for such purpose and we were given a plastic jug\r\nfor our urination.\r\nQ. Who collect the wastes or were they left with the detainees\r\nall day?\r\nA. At that time the people who worked there in the common cell,\r\nthe person whose age was about 15 years old, would go up and\r\ncollect the waste because the detainees would only be put to lie\r\ndown in the cell and could not be moved.\r\nQ. You mentioned about the food ration, the thin gruel with very\r\nfew rice grains and sometimes you would be offered a watery soup\r\nwith water grass.  The question is how food was provided to you?\r\nWere you fed with a plate, a spoon or what was it like when food\r\nwas delivered to you, and how often did you get the meals?\r\nA. When it was time to eat it was at 12 or 11.30; let's say\r\nbetween 11.30 to 1.  That's for lunch.  In the afternoon, late\r\nafternoon, the food was served at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. and when the\r\nfood was carried to the place then they would leave it there, and\r\nif people made noise then they would be beaten with the stick\r\nthat they used to carry the food to the detainees.  I felt very\r\npity for them and for myself because we were treated like\r\nanimals.  We whispered to one another, I mean to the neighbours,\r\nbut we could not make loud noise.\r\nQ. Did the detainees have to share -- have to distribute the\r\nporridge or the gruel, or were they distributed by the guards?\r\nA. We were given the gruel on a plate by the guards, and after we\r\nfinished the meal then the plates and spoon would be collected\r\nbecause they were afraid that those items could be used for the\r\ndetainee to commit suicide, because every night people would come\r\nto search for any metal items or sharp items.  I did not know why\r\nthey came to search for those items.\r\nQ. When you were thirsty what would you do?\r\nA. We had to ask for permission; for example, \"Brother, I am\r\nthirsty.  Could you please give me some water?\"\r\nQ. So it means in the common cell there were the prison guards\r\nwho stationed there regularly.  Is that correct?\r\nPlease wait until you see the red light before you respond.\r\nA. When I needed some water I would ask them for the water and\r\nthey would give it to me.\r\nTHE INTERPRETER:\r\nThe President's mic is not on.\r\nBY MR. PRESIDENT:\r\nQ. Now, you have not answered the questions about the guards who\r\nwould be regularly stationed at the cell, and you said that when\r\nyou would like to relieve yourself or you were thirsty you would\r\nask the guard.  My question was:  were there regular prison\r\nguards at that location, and how many guards were there in your\r\nroom?\r\nA. I think guards would be seen walking on the corridor, several\r\nof them, because we were locked inside and we could see them\r\nwalking on the corridor, passing the windows.  And when we needed\r\nto relieve ourselves then we would call them.  But they gave us\r\nthe boxes for relieving ourselves, although we were not removed\r\nour shackles.  But I seem to be forgotten when it comes to how we\r\ncould ask them when we would like to relieve ourselves, but I am\r\nsure that we were shackled at all times.\r\nQ. I think we learned from you that there were the plastic jug\r\nand ammunition box placed for the detainees to relieve\r\nthemselves, but when you were thirsty how could you do it,\r\nbecause there were no water jars left with water for detainees,\r\nso you had to shout to the guards?  I mean, if you shouted it\r\nmeans that the guards would be outside but if they were inside,\r\nthe detainees would not need to shout to alert them.\r\nHowever, during the time when you had a bath -- because you were\r\ndetained quite a long time from mid-1977 to 1979 and you were\r\ndetained the longest there among the others, so when it comes to\r\nhaving a bath, what was it like?\r\nA. When we had a bath we would take off our shorts and then\r\nremove it from our legs, one leg at a time, and then we had to be\r\nnaked and then the water would be sprayed from outside through a\r\nwater hose, and some would get soaked, some would miss the water.\r\nAnd then we would use the clothes to dry the water.  It was so\r\nmiserable because we would -- had been treated like the cattle\r\nwhile we were sprayed the water on.\r\nWhen we asked for water, of course we had to ask them for\r\npermission.  Otherwise we would never be given such water to\r\ndrink.\r\nQ. You said you took off your shorts to dry the water.  What was\r\nthe purpose of doing so?\r\nA. We only used them to dry the floor so that we could -- when\r\nthe floor dried then we could lie down, because the water floods\r\nthe floors and we had to dry it to make sure that it's dry.\r\nQ. So the purpose of removing your shorts was to dry the floor so\r\nthat you could sleep on it.  Is that correct?\r\nA. That is correct, Mr. President.\r\nQ. How often were you sprayed the water on like this?\r\nA. Once every week or maybe once every fortnight.  I don't\r\nremember; you know, it has been 30 years or more already, but I\r\nknow that every time we had a bath, everyone had to be naked.  It\r\nwas like hell.\r\nEveryone would look the same and sometimes they mocked at us.\r\nThey said that you guys look small physically but your thing was\r\nnot that small.  I'm sorry to say that, but we would laugh by\r\nmocking on some other things, private things.\r\nQ. When you were detained, besides being removed from the\r\nshackles to be interrogated, were you released to do exercises,\r\nfor example, every now and then or were you never allowed to do\r\nthat?\r\nA. I don't remember it.  I think we were never allowed to do\r\nexercise in the room or maybe we were allowed to do so.  I am not\r\nsure because it has been so long already.\r\nQ. When you were taken to be interrogated, how was the process\r\ncarried out?\r\nA. Every time I was taken to be interrogated, they would handcuff\r\nme and walked to the compound of the prison to Building A.  I\r\nthink the previous trace of the building vanished over time and I\r\nthink I could never take any visitors to the same original\r\nlocation as it already altered.\r\nQ. When you were removed from shackles, then you would be\r\nhandcuffed before you would be walked to be interrogated.  Can\r\nyou please tell us how this process would be carried out?\r\nA. I was walked to the interrogation room into the house.  We\r\nwalked to upstairs.\r\nQ. No, I'm talking about the time when you were in the room and\r\nwere shackled, and then you were shackled and attached to other\r\npeople, other detainees.  And before you were taken to the\r\ninterrogation room, would you be removed from the shackles and\r\nthen walked outside of your room before you would be re-shackled\r\nagain and walked to the interrogation room?\r\nA. They removed the shackles from the long bar.  The shackles\r\nwere removed then they cuffed -- they put the cuffs on me again\r\nand then they walked to the outside area of the room, or the\r\nprison.\r\nQ. Were you blindfolded when you were being walked away?\r\nA. Of course, I was blindfolded while I was being walked away.\r\nQ. Could you please tell us about the moment when you were put\r\ninto the room for interrogation?  How were you treated by the\r\nguards?\r\nA. They treated us -- they used derogatory language to me and\r\nthey shackled me by my ankles -- the long bar of shackles which\r\nwas about half a metre -- and then they locked the chain and then\r\nthey closed all the windows and doors.  No, I think the windows\r\nwould be left open because there were metal bars.  I could see\r\nBuilding A or B clearly.\r\nAfter I was shackled and they removed the handcuffs and removed\r\nthe blindfold, and then they started to beat me to answer when I\r\nentered CIA and KGB.  I told them that I did not know anything\r\nabout it and I could not answer anything about CIA and KGB.\r\nI kept repeating my response and they kept beating me and, of\r\ncourse, if we did not respond or answer to satisfy their request,\r\nthen we would be beaten severely.\r\nQ. During the time when you were interrogated, you would be\r\nshackled and then you would be asked to sit on the floor while\r\nyour handcuffs would be removed along with the blindfold before\r\nyou would be interrogated.  In case you did not respond to what\r\nthey wanted to get the confession from you, then you would be\r\nbeaten with a stick.  Do I understand you correctly?\r\nA. They removed the blindfold and handcuffs.  They put me to lie\r\nface down and then they started to beat me until they had enough,\r\nand then they kept asking me when I entered CIA and KGB and who\r\nintroduced me into the agents.  And I did not know how to respond\r\nto them because the person who worked honestly and worked the\r\nbest to serve Angkar and never been involved in such\r\norganization, how could I respond to them that I introduced\r\nanyone into the CIA, even myself.  I did not know what CIA was.\r\nQ. You said you were shackled and put face down.  I find it\r\ndifficult to understand because if you talk about the shackle,\r\nthen you could sit up.  And how could you be put face down and\r\nthen if you were shackled before that, you could not sit up\r\nbecause it was a wooden kind of shackles.  Then you put your legs\r\n-- or your legs were put into the shackle then you would not be\r\nable to lie face down on the floor.\r\nOr were you put to lie face down on the floor and tortured before\r\nthey removed the shackles, and then -- or what?  Could you please\r\nclarify it to me or to the Court?\r\nA. It was not a wooden shackle, Mr. President.  It was a metal\r\nbar, long bar, designed to only put on one individual detainee.\r\nAfter having that long metal bar attached to my legs and my\r\nankles, then they locked both ends and then they put me to lie\r\nface down in order for the interrogator to be able to beat me on\r\nmy back and I could put my face down.\r\nQ. Were you taken to be interrogated immediately when you were\r\nsent during the first night at S-21 or were you kept a few days;\r\nonly later that they would take you to be interrogated?\r\nA. Mr. President, I was detained for quite a long time.  I think\r\nit was until May or June 1977 so I had been detained for four or\r\nfive months before I was interrogated and tortured.  And as I\r\nstated earlier, then a guy came and asking for anyone who could\r\npaint.\r\nQ. Can you try to recall the S-21 staff who took you for\r\ninterrogation and torture?  How many times were you taken and\r\nwhat about the types of torture?\r\nA. Mr. President, when -- for every times they interrogated and\r\ntortured me, they did not use or change the method.  First, they\r\nused a rattan stick or a whip to beat me up.  They beat me up\r\nwith the stick or the whip for the two sessions.  So from 7 until\r\n12 or 1 p.m. in the morning, then I was allowed to eat and in the\r\nafternoon, they only stopped after 6 or 7 p.m. when I was taken\r\nback to the room.  After they beat me up, they did not take me to\r\nthe common room.  They took me to the individual cell.  So every\r\ntime after the interrogation and the torture, I was taken to the\r\nground floor -- to the individual cell.  And for the mealtime,\r\nthen we were fed with a bowl of food.\r\nQ. So in summary, you were detained in two different rooms.\r\nFirst, you were in the common room and about five months later,\r\nwhen they started to interrogate and torture you by using the\r\nstick, then you were detained in an individual cell.  Is that\r\ncorrect?\r\nA. Mr. President, that is correct.\r\nQ. Was your torture in a different method; for example, by\r\nelectrocution?\r\nA. Yes, Mr. President.\r\nOne day after they beat me down -- they beat me up, they walked\r\nme to Building D and there was a power outlet on the wall and\r\nthen they used an electrical wire to electrocute me.  I felt\r\nunconscious and later on they used the water to pour on my face\r\nand I became unconscious again.  I did not know the voltage of\r\nthat electricity, but once they started it, I felt unconscious\r\nimmediately.  That was done in Building D.\r\nQ. I already asked you and you said that you did not know if you\r\ncommitted any offence so when you were detained in the prison,\r\nwas there any decision by a trial committee to punish or sentence\r\nyou -- for example, in a form of a trial in a similar form of\r\nthis Chamber -- during your detention there?\r\nA. Mr. President, no, there was no judgment; no order from\r\nanybody.  We were just detained.  And one day after they\r\nexhausted by beating me up, then they walked me back into the\r\nroom and while at the path walking to our Building D -- there was\r\nno concrete path there at the time  -- and at that juncture, I\r\nwas beaten up again.  And another person came and said, \"Don't\r\nbeat him up today because Brother instructed so.  Keep him\r\nalive.\"\r\nBecause there were a lot of wounds on my back, I felt so painful,\r\nbut because they beat me up so I had to lie down on my back.\r\nHowever, Him Huy used a stick to push under my back and a lot of\r\ngravels went inside the wound on my back so because it was so\r\npainful, then I had to turn myself again for them to beat me up\r\non the back.\r\nQ. When did they decide to use you as a painter?\r\nA. One day, I was taken from that individual cell to the upper\r\nfloor for treatment.  Actually, there was no medicine at all.\r\nThere was a bowl of saltwater and they just poured that saltwater\r\non my back and it was so, so painful because of my open wounds\r\nand the salt.  You could see when you used the salt on the frog,\r\nyou could see the effects and you could imagine how painful it\r\nwas when they pour the water -- the saltwater on my back.  And\r\nindeed, finally the wounds recovered from the saltwater.\r\nSometimes, I was given a rabbit pellet tablet.  It was so\r\nmiserable.\r\nQ. And now to the scars from the beating; do you still have the\r\nscars or are they completely gone?\r\nA. The wounds recovered, but the scars are everywhere on my back,\r\non my shoulders.  They were the scars from being whipped or\r\nbeaten.  Sometimes, there were five of them beating me up at the\r\nsame time.\r\nQ. Can we see the scars on your back?\r\nMS. STUDZINSKY:\r\nMr. President, I would like to make break now before Mr. Bou Meng\r\nshows his scars and to decide if this is appropriate -- an\r\nappropriate measure now and maybe it is time for an adjournment,\r\nand that would be great if he could get it.\r\nThank you.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nNow it is time for a break.  The Chamber will take a 20 minute\r\nbreak until 11 a.m. when the Chamber will resume.\r\n(Judges exit courtroom)\r\n(Court recesses from 10H38 until 11H02)\r\n(Judges enter courtroom)\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nPlease be seated.  The Chamber is now back in session.\r\nWe would like to inform the parties and the public that the\r\nChamber now cancels its attempts to show the scars on the\r\nsurvivor's back and all parties are also reminded not to proceed\r\nwith the request to show the scars on the survivor's back.\r\nDo you have any further requests or observations?\r\nMS. STUDZINSKY:\r\nThank you, Mr. President.  We would suggest to proceed in closed\r\nsession and then Mr. Bou Meng could show the scars to the Chamber\r\nand the parties.  That is something that could be a possibility\r\nto do.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nThe Chamber already decided to cancel its attempts to show the\r\nscars, even if in an in camera hearing.  In case of necessity, it\r\ncan be shown by photos.  So the photos can be shown of the scars\r\non his back.  Bou Meng, you think you can have those photos for\r\nthe Chamber?\r\nMR. BOU MENG:\r\nMr. President, I do not have any photos of the marks.  I only\r\nhave the marks on my body.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nThe Chamber would like to request to take photos of your -- of\r\nthe scars or your marks that can be displayed on the screen.  Do\r\nyou agree to this proposal?\r\nMR. BOU MENG:\r\nYes, I agree.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nQ. Next, so you were chosen to be a painter.  When were you\r\nchosen?\r\nA. Mr. President, towards the later '77, because in early 1978 I\r\nalready painted a canvas.  One day I heard the noise from the\r\nloudspeaker, I think they celebrated something at the Olympic\r\nStadium, and we were given a lot of food.  We ate to our fill and\r\nthe guards gave us the food.  And I even have the noodles,\r\nChinese noodles to eat.\r\nAnd Nath said I had to jump, to jump up so that the food will go\r\ndown lower through my stomach and I can eat more to fill to my\r\nstomach.  And I told him, \"Once you are full, you are full.  You\r\nonly have one stomach to fill in.\"\r\nI think I started painting the portrait in late '77 or early '78\r\nbecause there were four portraits and each portrait, when Duch\r\nasked me, \"How long did it take to make that portrait?  And the\r\nportrait must look the same as the photo,\" and I told him -- I\r\nrequested to have three months to make that portrait because the\r\ncanvas was huge.  It was 1.5 metres wide and three metres high.\r\nI would like to seek your permission to show the portrait of Pol\r\nPot that I painted.  I survived because I could paint the exact\r\nportrait of Pol Pot, so I was spared until to the 7th January,\r\n'79.\r\nThis is my response, Your Honour.\r\nQ. During the time that you were released to work by doing the\r\npainting, where did you paint and who else worked with you in\r\nthat location?\r\nA. Mr. President, yes, I myself, Bou Meng; Vann Nath too; Im\r\nChan, the wood sculptor and the wax moulder, another wax moulder;\r\nso that's all.  And we worked in Building E.  Building E is the\r\nbuilding in the middle of the compound.  I think that is used as\r\nthe reception area for the guests who come to visit the museum.\r\nQ. What about the food ration after you were chosen to work as a\r\npainter?  Was the food ration the same as those given to the\r\nprisoners?\r\nA. Mr. President, the food ration was better than previously, so\r\nit was from the thin gruel to rice and we had sufficient soup.\r\nSo the prison guard carried the soup to deliver it to us and we\r\nshared among ourselves.\r\nQ. During the time you were selected to work as a painter, where\r\nwere you allowed to sleep at night?\r\nA. After I painted and when it was time to sleep, it was at the\r\ngenerator's room.  It was behind Building E.  At that time there\r\nwas a generator there, so when the electricity was cut off, then\r\nthey started the generator and we slept in that generator's room.\r\nQ. Were you cuffed or shackled in that room or were you locked\r\nfrom outside?\r\nA. I was allowed to sleep in that room but I was not cuffed or\r\nshackled, so there was seven of us -- Oeng Bech, Vann Nath, Im\r\nChan, Pha Tha Chan, Ruy Makong.  There were seven of us -- and\r\nChum Mey.  I requested to see the photo: Pha Tha Chan, Bou Meng,\r\nVann Nath, Im Chan, Ruy Makong and Chum Mey.  And now only Chum\r\nMey, Vann Nath and Bou Meng are alive.  The other four died.\r\nMS. STUDZINSKY:\r\nThank you, Mr. President.  I would like to suggest to the Court\r\nofficials to show the photo on the screen.  Thank you.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nI don't think it is yet your time.  It is now my question and I\r\nhave the discretion.\r\nBY MR. PRESIDENT:\r\nQ. During the times you were asked to do the painting, did you\r\nmeet the accused, Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch?\r\nA. Mr. President, Your Honours, at that time Mr. Kaing Guek Eav,\r\nalias Duch, sat next to me watching me painting the portrait of\r\nBrother Number One, Pol Pot, and he ordered me, \"You should\r\nadjust the throat.  It's not a tumour, it's just fat.\"  So as can\r\nbe seen from this photo which was taken of the portraits that I\r\npainted, so you could see that the throat was slimmer.\r\nQ. Did he come to visit you often to see you painting?  And if he\r\ncame, during the day or nighttime?\r\nA. He came often during the daytime and he wore shorts and a\r\nshort-sleeved shirt.  So he came in, he sat with his one leg\r\nacross and watching me drawing, for example, another portrait of\r\nthe head of Ho Chi Minh on the body of a dog.  It was like a\r\ncartoon which they -- it was like a sketch of the sea with a\r\nflat, windy situation, et cetera and et cetera.\r\nQ. Did you notice his character and behaviour during the time\r\nthat he watched you making the painting or the portrait?\r\nA. Mr. President, he did not really beat me up, however, one day\r\nI didn't know what I did wrong.  He asked me and Im Chan to beat\r\neach other up.  So we were given a piece of black plastic tube to\r\nhit, to beat each other, and he sat there watching us beating\r\neach other up.  After a while he ordered us to stop.\r\nBut if I could make a very lifelike portrait, he would look at it\r\ncarefully and I think I lost some of the portraits.\r\nQ. The question is, did you observe his facial expression or his\r\nbehaviour; that is the behaviour of the accused, Kaing Guek Eav,\r\nalias Duch, during the time that he went to watch you painting?\r\nWas he a person full of joy or full of sorrow?  Did you notice\r\nthat?\r\nA. Mr. President, his facial expression was normal.  If he needed\r\nto laugh, he laughed.  Sometimes he smiled.  I could see him\r\nthrough his face but I could not judge his feeling or emotion,\r\nand that's the word I was asked especially by a journalist, and I\r\nalways tell them, \"I know his face but I don't know his feeling\".\r\nHe was close to me, observing me painting.  Sometimes he gave me\r\ncigarettes to smoke.\r\nQ. Did he ever beat you up personally?\r\nA. No, but he ordered me to beat up with Im Chan.  I was not\r\nhappy with that.  He did not treat me like a human being.\r\nQ. Did you ever see him going from one building to the next\r\nwithin the compound of the prison; for example, from Building A\r\nto B to C, or did he only enter the compound and only come to the\r\nplace where you worked?\r\nA. Mr. President, I did not see him walking along each building\r\nbecause when he entered his main focus was on the portrait of\r\nBrother Number One, Pol Pot.  I only saw him coming to my\r\nworkshop.  I did not see him going anywhere else.\r\nQ. So besides him, besides you yourself, did you see him\r\ntorturing or beating up other prisoners?\r\nA. Mr. President, let me go back a little bit.\r\nOne day there was a Vietnamese citizen.  He boasted that he could\r\nmake a wax mould and then he was ordered to show his skill.  So\r\nhe was tested and Duch saw that he could not do it.  Then he\r\nordered the interrogators to kick him like kick a ball because,\r\nfrom what I understood, he was angry that that person lied to\r\nhim.  And I did not know what happened to that Vietnamese person.\r\nProbably he was taken out.\r\nQ. Did he himself order the guards or his subordinates to torture\r\nthat person?  And if he did order, can you recall his exact\r\nwords; that is, the words that Duch used to order his\r\nsubordinates to torture that Vietnamese person?\r\nA. Mr. President, I forget some parts.  I am not sure.  I think\r\nprobably he signalled his guards to beat that Vietnamese person.\r\nAnd the Vietnamese person was taken away from the workshop where\r\nI worked.  So there were woodcrafters; there was a painter and\r\nanother artist.  We worked in the same workshop.\r\nQ. You saw the guards beating up that person who boasted about\r\nhis skill.  Was the beating taking place within the workshop\r\nvicinity in Building E or was he taken out and beaten up outsides\r\nthat area?\r\nA. Mr. President, at that time the three or four of them kicked\r\nthat Vietnamese person and beat him up and walked him away.  I\r\ndid not hear his order.  So when those guards beat the Vietnamese\r\nperson up, Duch had already left.\r\nQ. So during the time you were asked to work as a painter, how\r\nmany portraits did you paint and whose portraits were they?\r\nA. There were four portraits of Pol Pot.  However, there was\r\nanother portrait in 1981.  There was a German group to make a\r\nfilm on that portrait, so I showed the portrait to the person and\r\nthen I used paint to make a cross sign on that person to express\r\nmy hatred of that person, and that was filmed by the German\r\ngroup.\r\nQ. You said that you painted various other paintings or\r\nportraits; for example, a painting of a dog with the Ho Hi Minh\r\nhead on it.  But for Pol Pot portraits you only made four\r\nportraits?\r\nA. That is correct, Mr. President.\r\nQ. So besides the portraits of Brother Number One, Pol Pot, did\r\nyou make any other painting or portrait?\r\nA. Mr., President, yes, I painted Hua Guofeng, Mao Zhedong in\r\nlarge canvas as well, so the canvas was as big as the canvas for\r\nPol Pot's portrait.\r\nQ. When you did your painting or portrait, did you do it\r\nindividually or together with Vann Nath?  That is, Vann Nath was\r\npainting his own painting or portrait and you yourself had a\r\nseparate painting or portrait?\r\nA. Mr. President, at that time he did not have a skill of\r\npainting black and white portraits so I mixed the black and white\r\npainting by myself with one litre of gasoline to burn it and the\r\nsmoke would go into that painting and then I mixed it.  And Vann\r\nNath did not have this skill.\r\nQ. So it means that your painting was separate from him because\r\none was colour and one was black and white.  Is that correct?\r\nA. Yes, that is correct.\r\nQ. You talked about the portrait of Pol Pot.  This is one of the\r\nportraits of other people that you painted.  Is that correct?\r\nA. Yes, Mr. President, that is correct.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nCourt officer, can you take a photo of the portrait of Pol Pot to\r\nbe projected on the monitor, on the slide?\r\nBY MR. PRESIDENT:\r\nQ. Is this the portrait of Pol Pot that you painted by yourself\r\nduring the time that you were detained there and then when you\r\nwere asked to make a drawing or portrait of the leader of the\r\nDemocratic Kampuchea?\r\nA. Yes, Mr. President, this is the portrait.\r\nQ. You stated just then that because of your skill of making the\r\nportrait that you survived until today.  Can you explain further\r\nthe reason of this portrait that led to the survival?\r\nA. Mr. President, the reason, from my understanding, is that my\r\npainting is a resemblance of the photo, so I started painting\r\nportraits 1, 2, 3 and 4 and another one.  While I was painting,\r\nthen the time came when the Vietnamese and the National United\r\nFront for Salvation army entered Phnom Penh and we fled.\r\nThey gathered us to move from the compound in one long straight\r\nline without stepping anywhere off the line or we would be shot.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nThe Court official, can you remove the sketch?\r\nBY MR. PRESIDENT:\r\nQ. There are still some other documents in which you stated that\r\nyou were sent to Prey Sar and then you stayed at Prey Sar for a\r\nwhile before you were returned to S-21.  What happened back then?\r\nIs it true that you were sent there?\r\nA. I think it is not true because I stayed in Tuol Sleng prison,\r\nbut when we were evacuated it would be true that I was walking\r\nand reached Prey Sar somewhere near Boeung Choueng Ek for about\r\nfive minutes, and then we later on were ordered to move to Prey\r\nSar prison.  I think after about 10 to 20 minutes then we would\r\nbe ordered to move further during the nighttime.\r\nQ. So you went to Prey Sar during the evacuation process when the\r\nUnited Front of the National Army actually liberated Phnom Penh,\r\nand you went along with the other people, so you were forced to\r\nmove out with other people.  Is it correct?  I think you were\r\nleaving on the 7th of January 1979; is that correct?\r\nA. Mr. President, it's correct, we left at night in the late\r\nevening at about 6 to 7 p.m.\r\nINTERPRETER:\r\nThe witness's mic is not activated.\r\nMR. BOU MENG:\r\nWe dragged our legs -- our feet.\r\nBY MR. PRESIDENT:\r\nQ. Please wait until you see the red light.\r\nThe question is where were you up to -- I mean, you were at Prey\r\nSar and then you moved forward to other locations.  So could you\r\nplease tell us about the date during the process you were\r\nmarching or you were getting out of town that time?\r\nA. We left Prey Sar prison at night and we walked to National\r\nRoad Number 4, and at dawn we saw the presence of the United\r\nFront army, and the guards who guarded us all the way while we\r\nwere on our journey then left us.  And I could proceed with Pha\r\nTha Chan and I did not know where the other people went to\r\nbecause Vann Nath also left us, except I and Pha Tha Chan who\r\nwould be left alone, and we walked until Amleang and stayed at\r\nPrey Chrov co-operative.\r\nI did not ask for the food from the co-operative because we would\r\nbe afraid that we would be killed, because if he got in trouble\r\nthen I would too be in big trouble.\r\nQ. When did you return?\r\nA. When Nath came to Phnomn Penh ahead of me and along with Oeng\r\nBech and Comrade Kong, and I walked with other people until I\r\nreached Pursat province.  And Vietnamese troops would be seen in\r\nseveral jungles.\r\nAnd at Svay Dangkao we could also see Vietnamese militaries and I\r\nwas recruited as the soldier during that time.  I worked as the\r\ntypist at that moment at the provincial office with Ros Sreng,\r\nKang Heang, who at that time were the governors.\r\nQ. Can we talk about your wife, because we have heard your good\r\naccounts of your story, because in your complaint you state about\r\nthe inhuman acts against you and your wife.  So now could you\r\nplease tell us a little bit about your wife when you were both\r\nsent and taken to S-21 while your photos were taken, biographies\r\nwere taken and while you were blindfolded and put into the\r\ndetention room?  Have you ever heard anything about your wife?\r\nA. After we were blindfolded and sent to the upper upstairs I\r\nhave never known or seen my wife.  But at one moment when I was\r\npainting the portrait of Pol Pot, Him Huy was outside of the\r\nwindow and told me that, \"Your wife was working in the rice\r\nfield,\" and then I told myself -- I thought that probably she\r\nwould be kept there to be killed, but I did not tell anybody\r\nbecause I only were thinking alone.  Because I was also a farmer\r\nand Duch once said that people could be used as fertilizer for\r\nrice field or rice farming and that's why I had to be very\r\ncareful and I had to work so hard to concentrate on my work and\r\nit took me three months to finish one portrait.\r\nQ. Have you ever learned anything about the fate of your wife or\r\nwhat happened to her?\r\nA. I don't know what happened to her, whether she would be\r\ntortured.  We were parted since we were taken into that common\r\nroom.  Until now we have never seen each other and I never know\r\nwhat happened to her.\r\nQ. Do you think that she would be killed at S-21, or what else?\r\nA. Your question reminds me the question that I would like to ask\r\nto Mr. Kaing Guek Eav, I want to know whether he asked his\r\nsubordinates to smash my wife at S-21 or at Choeung Ek so that I\r\ncould collect the ashes or remains so that I can make her soul\r\nrest in peace.\r\nQ. You have not answered to my question, but you would like to\r\nrefer the question to the accused; is that correct?  You said you\r\nhave obtained a photo of your wife named Yoeun alias Phy; have\r\nyou brought it along with you and when was the photo taken?\r\nA. I have the photo with me.  If you would wish me to present,\r\nthen I could present it to you.\r\nQ. When was the photo taken?  Was it taken during the time when\r\nyou were sent into S-21 or Tuol Sleng prison compound at that\r\nmoment when you were taken all together or was it just another\r\nphoto you took with her?\r\nA. This photo was taken during the time we were sent into S-21\r\nbecause her photo was taken first, followed by me.  You can see\r\nher ID on the photo.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nThe Greffier, could you please make sure that the photo could be\r\nprojected on the monitors?\r\nBY MR. PRESIDENT:\r\nQ. Is your wife, Yoeun alias Thy, what is her family name and how\r\nold was she at that time?\r\nA. Her name was Ma Yoeun alias Thy.\r\nQ. When she was taken photograph -- I mean, when you were sent\r\ninto S-21 office; how old was she?\r\nA. She was about 25 years old because I was about 30 years old;\r\nmaybe 36 or 37 years old.  I am nine years older than her.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nThe court official, could you please remove the photo from the\r\nmonitors?\r\nBY MR. PRESIDENT:\r\nQ. Now, the story of yourself and your family have been heard, we\r\nwould like to put\r\nfurther questions concerning the time when you were detained and\r\nthen later on, you were chosen to be the painter; the position\r\nyou hold until 7 January 1979.\r\nDuring that time, had you seen or been aware of any activities of\r\nthe guards at S-21 towards the other detainees?  Through your\r\nobservation and recollection, could you please tell the Court\r\nabout those events?\r\nA. During the time when I worked as a painter in Building E\r\npainting a portrait of Pol Pot, I could see through the window\r\nthe sending of Vietnamese soldiers and the Khmer Rouge soldiers\r\nwho were sent en masse into the compound.  I did not actually\r\nwitness the torture, but I heard the screams; people crying for\r\nhelp all around the compound.  I did not see the tortures\r\ndirectly, but I did hear people crying for help.\r\nQ. When you were detained in the common room, did you see dead\r\nbody of other detainees in the room and if you saw them, did you\r\nsee them often?\r\nA. Mr. President, I saw a dead body who was lying head to head\r\nwith me.  He was with dark complexion, a small person.  He was\r\ntaller than me.  He was about the same age as me.  If he would\r\nlive, now he would be 67, 68.  A young guard stamped on his chest\r\nand he coughed with blood and he was lying dead there inside the\r\ncommon room.  At night, he would be taken to be buried in the\r\ncompound not far from that.\r\nQ. So how long was it -- I mean, the interval between the time\r\nwhen the person died and the time when he was buried?\r\nA. I noticed that he was dead in the daytime and then late at\r\nnight -- I can't remember when, but it was at night that the\r\nperson disappeared and would be buried.  I don't know where he\r\nwould be buried or discarded because I was still shackled and I\r\ndidn't know more about something outside.\r\nQ. You were detained and shackled for a long period of time\r\nbefore you were let out to be a painter.  And have you noticed\r\nthe people who were sent in and shackled along with you in the\r\nsame room would be taken out and disappeared or had they returned\r\nor have you noticed that?\r\nA. I'm talking before the God, the Buddha.  I'm talking the\r\ntruth.  People would be put into the trucks and carried away and\r\nthey never returned.  And after being interrogated, I would be\r\nkept downstairs and I did not know much about the fate of those\r\npeople, but when I was in the common room, people who would be\r\ntaken away would never come back so they just disappeared.\r\nQ. What about the other situation, for example, when a detainee\r\nwas so weak that he would be carried to the truck or to the other\r\nlocation?  Had you seen such scenes?\r\nA. I did witness the very thin person who were tied to his legs\r\nand arms, and a stick would be put to -- and then carried by two\r\npeople.  He was carried like a pig, like people would be carrying\r\na pig, and he was passing the place where I was painting, and the\r\nguard banged the door shut in order not to let me see them\r\ncarrying that very sick and thin detainee.  I did not know where\r\nhe was up to.\r\nQ. Were they carrying the dead body or a person who's still\r\nalive?\r\nA. He was not yet dead.  He was still breathing and then he would\r\nbe carried onto the truck waiting outside the prison.  We could\r\nhear the sound of the truck coming in and out all day long.\r\nQ. I think you should have known about this, about the trucks\r\nthat came and take people away all night.  Can you tell us\r\nwhether the trucks only came during the night or during the\r\ndaytime, or detainees would be taken by the trucks at any time\r\nfrom S-21?  I mean, those people who would be taken away and\r\nwould never return.\r\nA. I was in the common cell or common room.  After being\r\ninterrogated, I was put in the cell and I could hear the sound of\r\nthe trucks.  I never saw the trucks; just heard the sound, the\r\nnoise.  I did not know or see the detainees.  I only saw him once\r\nwhen I was painting the portrait of Pol Pot while they were\r\ncarrying him, passing me.\r\nQ. So was it at night or during the daytime?  I'm asking this\r\nbecause after hearing testimony we have received two different\r\nkinds of information, especially concerning the transportation of\r\ndetainees to Choeung Ek, because the information we obtained so\r\nfar is that detainees would only be sent during the night.\r\nAnother thing is that I don't know whether you're confused among\r\ntwo of you.  One witness who testified said that during the time\r\nhe was detained at the location from the morning until 12 p.m. he\r\nwould not be able to sleep because he wait until 12 p.m. passed\r\nso that he knew that no people would be carried away to be killed\r\nafter that.  So that's why I would like you to clarify whether\r\nprisoners would be taken at night or in the daytime, especially\r\nregarding the person who was very sick and would be carried away\r\nby two people with a stick.  Was it done during the day or at\r\nnight?\r\nA. At that time I did not see at night, of course, but I saw it\r\nduring the daytime.  It was about 9 or 10 a.m.; I think more or\r\nless at about nine, between 9 and 10 a.m.\r\nQ. Normally when the trucks came, were the trucks driven to\r\nBuilding E or just they were parked right in front of the\r\nentrance; close to Building B or C, for example?\r\nA. Mr. President, regarding the trucks that transported the\r\ndetainees, the truck parked outside under the gate -- I mean near\r\nthat gate.  The truck did not come into the compound of the\r\nprison.  They parked outside.\r\nQ. Did you notice other activities of the staff at S-21 towards\r\nother detainees?\r\nA. When I was painting at Tuol Sleng, I saw female detainees.\r\nSome pregnant detainees would be walked away while being kicked\r\nby the guards -- female guards.  And they asked them to walk\r\nfaster and they walked past Building B and then -- I mean from\r\nsouth to north, from Building A to B.  I did not know where they\r\nwould be detained, but they passed us while we were painting the\r\nportraits.\r\nQ. The last question.  When you left with Uncle Nath and other\r\nsurvivors from S-21 on the 7th of January 1979, did you notice\r\nthat in the buildings of S-21 there were some prisoners left?\r\nA. Mr. President, I think it is more about freedom of the\r\nprisoners.  Prisoners were deprived of their liberty and we would\r\nnot be allowed to move, so people -- I think there was quiet\r\ninside.\r\nQ. My question is this.  I mean the last day, the last day when\r\nyou left S-21, because there were dead bodies on the beds.  There\r\nwere 14 of them.  Some witnesses would say that there were only\r\n10; the accused said that there were only four people; and now\r\nthe survivors, including you yourself, have noticed that there\r\nwould be some kind of noise and could see people were still left\r\ninside the building during the time when you were leaving the\r\npremises.\r\nThe question is whether you could receive any information or see\r\nthat detainees still were there on the 17th (sic) of January\r\n1979, the moment before you were leaving S-21.  So just tell us\r\nwhether you saw people still there at the premises when you were\r\nleaving.\r\nA. Mr. President, the last day on the 7th of January I left S-21\r\nat about 9 a.m.  We heard the gunshots and we were ordered to\r\nleave immediately.  At that moment I did not see or hear any\r\nnoise, and I was so panicked that I did not pay attention to who\r\nwould remain, because they pointed the guns at us and they warned\r\nus not to even turn back.  We had to really walk forward\r\notherwise we would get killed or shot.  So I did not see any one\r\nI guess.\r\nBY MR. PRESIDENT:\r\nThank you very much, Uncle, for your responses.\r\nAnd it is now time to make an adjournment for lunch.  So the\r\nChamber will now take adjournment, and we resume at 1.30 p.m.\r\nThe court official, please make sure that Uncle Bou Meng is\r\noffered the food, and please bring him back to the courtroom by\r\none thirty.\r\nThe security guards, please take the accused to the detention\r\nfacility and bring him in by one thirty.\r\nThe court is adjourned for lunch.\r\n(Judges exit courtroom)\r\n(Court recesses for lunch from 1200H until 1331H)\r\n(Judges enter courtroom)\r\nMR. PRESIDENT\r\nPlease be seated.  The Chamber is now back in session.\r\nBY MR. PRESIDENT:\r\nQ. Uncle Meng, when the interrogators stopped torturing you\r\nbecause you agreed to confess and it was a false confession, was\r\nit based on the purpose in order to satisfy the interrogators, or\r\nyou survived because of your skill as a painter?\r\nA. Mr. President, regarding the torture inflicted upon me --\r\nafter they still couldn't extract the confession from me because\r\nI gave the same response every day, and because I did not know\r\nwho was the leader or who introduced me into the CIA or KGB, they\r\nkept beating me up every day.\r\nAnd because they could not get my confession, they took me to the\r\nbuilding which is now where you can purchase the ticket to visit\r\nthe museum.  I was asked to sit there and they wrote a false\r\nconfession and ordered me to sign.  I can not recall the content\r\nof that confession, it's been so many years now, and also because\r\nof the serious torture inflicted upon me my memory was not good.\r\nAnd at that time, if my memory was like I am now, I would not be\r\nable to paint the portrait and I would not survive because during\r\nthat time if they thought somebody lied, especially lying to\r\nAngkar, then that one would be dead.\r\nQ. During the time that they decided to use you as a painter to\r\npaint the portraits of the leaders, including Brother Number 1,\r\nPol Pot, and other leaders including the Chinese leader as you\r\nstated, what happened during the times that you did the painting?\r\nFor instance, were you detained again as a prisoner?\r\nA. Mr. President, no.  During the times that I did the painting I\r\nworked every day regularly so it took me a long time to complete\r\nthe four portraits.  That was after I had been tortured.\r\nQ. Until now, can you try to remember or recall, besides the\r\nserious torture inflicted upon you with the present scars on your\r\nback until today, was the situation of receiving torture\r\nphysically or emotionally, did it happen elsewhere?\r\nA. Mr. President, if you talk about my memory, I am very\r\nforgetful now.  My memory is not as good as when I was young.\r\nFor example, if I leave something somewhere, sometimes I forget\r\nwhere I left it.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT\r\nJudges of the Bench, do you have any questions to be put to Uncle\r\nBou Meng?\r\nJudge Cartwright, you take the floor.\r\nJUDGE CARTWRIGHT:\r\nThank you, Mr. President.\r\nBY JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:\r\nQ. Mr. Bou Meng, you were at S-21 for a very long time and you\r\nhave described your suffering and your experiences there; thank\r\nyou for that.  But I have just one or two small questions to ask\r\nyou.\r\nI want to know something about other prisoners whom you might\r\nhave seen at S-21.  You have talked about the people who were in\r\nthe same room shackled as you were.  You have spoken of seeing\r\nsome pregnant women being kicked by female guards and told to\r\nwalk more quickly.\r\nDid you see any foreigners at S-21, other than the large number\r\nof Vietnamese soldiers that you have described?\r\nA. Your Honour, the inmates in the common room where I was\r\ndetained, there were some foreigners.  I was not sure of their\r\nnationality, whether they were European, American or Australian.\r\nThey were detained in the same common room as I was detained, and\r\nthey had the same food ration as I received.\r\nQ. Were you aware of any foreigners other than westerners or\r\nVietnamese, such as Thais, people from Thailand?\r\nA. Your Honour, I did not see any Thai citizens.  I only saw\r\nVietnamese people and some foreigners.  They were tall, they had\r\nbright eyes, and sort of bronze hair.  Besides that I did not see\r\nany other nationality, including Thai.\r\nQ. In addition to the Vietnamese soldiers, whom you saw, did you\r\nsee any ordinary Vietnamese people; that is people who were not\r\nsoldiers?\r\nA. Your Honour, yes, I saw civilian people.  They were not\r\nsoldiers.  And I saw these one civilian, as I said earlier, he\r\nsaid he knew he was a real artist, but when Duch ordered him to\r\ntest, to make the mould and he couldn't do it, and, of course, at\r\nthat time Angkar was not happy -- was not happy of anybody lying\r\nto Angkar.  And I don't have anything else to say regarding this\r\nquestion.\r\nQ. The people whom you think might have been westerners, and the\r\nordinary Vietnamese people whom you saw, were they all treated\r\nthe same way as you were?\r\nA. Your Honour, for the prisoners the treatment was not the same.\r\nFor example, I, myself, I received very serious torture, so only\r\nI, myself, knew clearly about what happened to me, and I cannot\r\nsay about what happened to other inmates.\r\nQ. Did you see many children at S-21?\r\nA. Your Honour, for children at S-21, I did not see any of them\r\nwalking around or detained there.  I only saw those children in\r\nthe photos, but I did not see them personally during the time of\r\nmy detention.  This is my frank and honest response.\r\nQ. Did you ever hear the sounds of children around S-21?\r\nA. Your Honour, for the sound of children, I did not hear.  I\r\nonly heard the screaming, asking for help of the adult people\r\nwhile I was in the common room.  And while I was in the\r\nindividual room, individual cell, I also heard the screaming, but\r\nthe screaming of the adult, not the children.\r\nJUDGE CARTWRIGHT:\r\nThank you very much, Mr. Bou Meng.\r\nMr. President, I have no further questions.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nJudges of the Bench, do you have any questions?\r\nJudge Lavergne, you take the floor.\r\nBY JUDGE LAVERGNE:\r\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. Bou Meng.\r\nI also have a few questions to ask you, to try to clarify what\r\nyou already explained in detail to the Chamber earlier on today.\r\nI think I understood through what you said this morning, and\r\nthrough what I have read in your testimony, that your life was\r\nessentially impacted by many sacrifices, and by a life of\r\nobedience.  And you said this morning that you answered Prince\r\nSihanouk's call in 1970 to free Cambodia, to liberate Cambodia.\r\nIs that so?\r\nA. At that time, I heard the appeal of the Prince Sihanouk on the\r\nradio broadcast.  I was not sure which broadcast was it.  He\r\nappealed for his children to go to the maquis forest to struggle,\r\nso I decided to enter the maquis forest in 1971 with another\r\nfriend from K25 office.\r\nSo we went to the maquis forest to make some sketches and drawing\r\nof Marx and Lenin.  I was the one who drew the pictures of Marx\r\nand Lenin.  And those sketches were stencilled and distributed to\r\nvarious units in order to understand the supreme leaders of the\r\nCommunists -- of the Communist country.  There were five of them\r\nall together: Karl Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mao Zhedong.  So I even\r\ndrew the sketches of these people on the cloth.\r\nQ. So you worked there for the -- at the services of the\r\nCommunist Party of Kampuchea's propaganda.  You were very\r\nrespectful of what you were requested to do.  And then between\r\nthe end of your activity with the propaganda services and your\r\njob at the Orussei Technical School, did you do anything else\r\nbetween; was there another episode in your career?\r\nA. Your Honour, let me correct that.  It was called the Russei\r\nKeo Technical School, not Orussei Technical School.\r\nQ. Did you go directly from the propaganda services to the Russei\r\nKeo Technical School or did you do anything in between?\r\nA. In between that time -- in order to make it easier to\r\nunderstand, let me go back. First, I worked for the Ministry of\r\nCommerce, of State Commerce,  and Koy Thuon was the Prime\r\nMinister at the time.  I was requested to draw placards for a\r\nboat.  It was called Marinal Transport.  And I made some other\r\nplacards and signs and boards for those boats and vehicles while\r\nI was there.\r\nQ. Well, back then did you trust the CPK entirely?  Were you\r\nsomebody who was very much obedient, who would follow what you\r\nwere being told to do?\r\nA. Your Honour, that was my specialty, the skills that I had.  I\r\nknew that the evacuation of people from Phnom Penh disappointed\r\nme because I struggled, I was so sick with malaria, and in the\r\nend I received such a suffering which is indescribable.  I felt\r\nso regretful for such inhumane acts of leadership which did not\r\nsatisfy my willing -- my understanding.  I physically served them\r\nbut emotionally I did not, although I wore black shirt, but my\r\nmind was not black.  I did what I was instructed, based on my\r\nskill.\r\nThis is my response, Your Honour.\r\nQ. Was there a specific moment where you might have entirely lost\r\ntrust in the CPK?  Was there any moment when you said to yourself\r\nthat what you might have believed in did not correspond to\r\nreality?\r\nA. I don't really understand your question.  Can you rephrase\r\nyour question again and please try to be simplified and make it\r\nshort?\r\nQ. Well, can we say that when you were working for the Russei Keo\r\nSchool and when you worked previously for the propaganda\r\nservices, that you trusted the CPK and Angkar?\r\nA. Your Honour, I carry out the task based on the assignment from\r\nmy superior, including drawing the sketches of the machines or\r\nfor the new parts of the machines.  Everything was done based on\r\nthe instructions from the chairman of that technical school.\r\nThis is my response, Your Honour.\r\nQ. You explained that your superiors at the technical school had\r\nbeen arrested and that you yourself had been sent to be\r\nre-educated.  At that moment, was your trust in the CPK -- was it\r\n-- did it change or did you still have full trust in the CPK?\r\nA. At that time, Your Honour, I lost my trust because my\r\nperformance in carrying out the assignment was excellent, I did\r\nwhat I was asked, but I could not understand why I was\r\ntransferred to be re-educated at the Ta Lei Co-operative.  I was\r\ndisappointed and this is my frank response to you.  I no longer\r\nhad my trust.\r\nQ. But, however, despite the difficult conditions in which you\r\nwere, you continued obeying and you continued following the\r\norders that were given to you.  Is that why it was particularly\r\ndifficult for you to understand why you had been arrested by\r\nsecurity cadres of the CPK?\r\nA. Your Honour, at that time, I myself and some other people\r\ntotalling about 10, were transferred from the Russei Keo\r\nTechnical School to Ta Lei Co-operative and I did not know the\r\nreason for the transfer.\r\nHowever, before the transfer we were instructed to make our\r\nbiography, as I can recall, so I made my biography to the Angkar\r\nand about one or two months later I was transferred to the Ta Lei\r\nCo-operative amongst about 10 other people, including my wife.\r\nSo we were tempered to do hard labour at the Ta Lei Co-operative.\r\nI did not know the reason for the transfer, Your Honour.\r\nQ. Back then, had you heard of the security centres?  Were you\r\naware, for example, of the existence of S-21 or of other security\r\ncentres?\r\nA. Your Honour, regarding the security offices or the prisons, I\r\ndid not hear anything at all during the time, however, people\r\nkept disappearing.  Some probably were sent for re-education or\r\nsent for training here and there.\r\nI had heard a lot about transferring of people or relocation of\r\npeople starting from 1976, and I was wondering how come, while\r\npeople were still working good and they were transferred\r\nelsewhere?  Or whether they had any plan of transforming in the\r\nagriculture production?  I only had doubt in my mind, however, I\r\njust kept doing what I was given or instructed.\r\nSo I typed some documents that I was asked to do and I drew\r\nsketches for the students to study.  I could not understand their\r\nthinking.  They were in a higher class and I thought I belonged\r\nto the lower class with limited technical capability.\r\nQ. Can we say that you were not at all aware of having committed\r\nany kind of offence that you absolutely were not aware having\r\nbetrayed the CPK, that you had absolutely no awareness of being\r\npart of a group of traitors?\r\nA. When I came I knew that there was a Minister of Propaganda,\r\nMr. Ho Nim, who\r\ncalled me to draw a portrait of the embarkment structure.  And at\r\nthat time the current king was teaching students how to perform\r\nthe ballet dancing and then he told me to help draw a portrait of\r\nhis father.  And he called his father the normal, ordinary\r\nperson's language and I was surprised but I did not ask further\r\nquestions.\r\nProbably they saw the picture, the photo that the king asked me\r\nto draw; that's why they arrested me, or not.  I'm not quite\r\nsure.\r\nQ. This morning, you also talked, at length, about the\r\nill-treatment that was inflicted upon you.  You also talked about\r\nthe physiological consequences thereof.  You also said to us that\r\nyou still had scars.  I seem to have understood that these\r\ntortures led to other consequences, such as problems with your\r\nhearing.  Do you have other physiological conditions or\r\ndifficulties that you may ascribe to being the consequences of\r\nthat ill-treatment?\r\nA. I was slapped and I was beaten on the head; all kinds of\r\ntortures had been inflicted on me.  So in short, I believe that\r\nbecause I was severely tortured, that I look older than my age\r\nand I lose all the teeth, and I can observe that Brother Chum Mey\r\nstill have his teeth.  And also I have had problems with hearing\r\nand I think this is probably the consequence of the torture.  And\r\nI look much older than I am and if you compare to the age, I\r\nthink I should have not been that old if I was not tortured.\r\nQ. From what you can remember, do you have the feeling that the\r\npeople interrogating you were enjoying themselves by making you\r\nsuffer or seeing you suffer?\r\nA. During the time when I was being interrogated some people ate\r\nthe jackfruit and they threw the remaining -- the peel of the\r\njackfruit onto my head and I could feel like then I was perceived\r\nas enemy and prisoner.  I could not do anything but to let them\r\ndo whatever they wish and they did not show any mercy towards me\r\nas a human being.  And whenever I recall it, I cannot hold back\r\nmy tears.  I was so disappointed that I had devoted myself for\r\nthe work and after all I end up being tortured.  I wished I were\r\nkilled by the malaria in the jungle, but I think my life was\r\nvaluable that I could survive longer to be tortured again.\r\nThat's all, Your Honour.\r\nQ. When you were a painter at the workshop, do you now remember\r\nhaving been taken out of the workshop in relation to an incident?\r\nYou were taken away from the workshop for about two weeks; do you\r\nremember that?  Do you remember then coming back to the workshop,\r\nhaving to say you were sorry, seek forgiveness?  Do you remember\r\nhaving been kicked?  Do you remember this episode or something\r\nlike this, or do you not remember something like this happening\r\nto you?\r\nA. I think, through my recollection, this incident might not have\r\nhappened.  I knew that one of my neighbours in my next room was\r\ntaken away -- no, the guy who worked next to my school -- the\r\ntechnical school of Russei Keo.  A couple were taken or arrested.\r\nI don't know whether two of them or one of them was arrested but\r\nthey both disappeared.  Then it came my turn who were transferred\r\nto Ta Lei Co-operative and that's what I have seen and known and\r\nI think my memory is not that good.  Maybe I have not fully\r\nrecollected all the episodes, and accept my apologies for not\r\nbeing able to recall everything.  That's all.\r\nQ. Mr. Bou Meng, sorry, I was referring to the period when you\r\nwere working in the workshop at S-21.  You were at the workshop\r\nin S-21.  During that period when you were working at S-21\r\nworkshop, where you were working with Vann Nath and other\r\nartists; during that period, was there an episode the result of\r\nwhich was that you had to go and say sorry; that you had to go\r\nand apologize?\r\nA. I don't know whether the apologies were made to my colleagues\r\nor to the guards.  I'm not quite sure I understand the question.\r\nQ. Were you forced to apologize to your colleagues in the\r\nworkshop at S-21 or to other people?  Were you, one day, shackled\r\nor tied up and led to go and offer apologies to either your\r\ncolleagues or somebody else in the workshop?\r\nA. I cannot recall or maybe I forgot, because I never offered my\r\napologies to anyone, even to my colleagues.  It is based on my\r\nrecollection but of course I would have forgotten.  As the Khmer\r\nproverb says, \"The elephants with four legs would have collapsed\r\nsometime and the wise person would forget anyway.\"\r\nQ. Thank you, Mr. Bou Meng, for these responses.  I have one very\r\nlast question for you.\r\nThis morning you told us that the accused had talked about\r\nfertilizer, saying that humans could be fertilizer in the paddy\r\nfields.  Could you explain to us the meaning of this term,\r\nplease?\r\nA.  The statement is based on the accused Kaing Guek Eav, alias\r\nDuch.  He said that if I could not resemble the portrait of Pol\r\nPot then I would be used as the human fertilizer.\r\nAnd I didn't understand whether I would be used to produce\r\nfertilizer or would I be used as the fertilizer myself for the\r\nrice field.  That's what he asked me and I found it difficult to\r\nrespond to him also at that moment.\r\nQ. Thank you very much, Mr. Bou Meng.\r\nJUDGE LAVERGNE:\r\nI have no further questions, Mr. President.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nNext we would like to give the opportunity to the prosecutors to\r\nput questions to Uncle Bou Meng, the survivor of S-21.\r\nThe floor is yours.\r\nMR. SENG BUNKHEANG:\r\nThank you, Mr. President.\r\nQUESTIONING BY THE CO-PROSECUTORS\r\nBY MR. SENG BUNKHEANG:\r\nQ. Good afternoon, Uncle Bou Meng.\r\nI have a few questions to be put to you.  Regarding the food\r\nration, was it enough?\r\nA. The food ration, during the time when I was detained, was\r\ninadequate.  But when people were looking for someone who could\r\npaint and when I came out to work as the painter with Vann Nath,\r\nwith Kong, with Pha Tha Chan and Bech, the food was adequate.\r\nBut it was inadequate when I was still in the prison.\r\nAnd there would be other documents to support my arguments about\r\nthis condition.  You may refer to it.  Thank you.\r\nQ. Thank you.\r\nWhen you were being detained at S-21 in the common room and in\r\nthe individual cell, you said that the food ration was\r\ninadequate.  How could you fulfil your hunger?\r\nA. There was no substitute.  I was so hungry.  When I saw the\r\nlizard crawling on the ceiling I would wish that it dropped down\r\nso that I could grab it and eat to fulfil my hunger.  I told\r\nmyself that I did not know what kind of bad deeds I committed\r\npreviously that I would be treated like this without enough food,\r\nwithout enough water, and I was questioning myself and I was\r\nasking myself what kind of mistakes I had committed that I would\r\nend up being here.\r\nAnd I was thinking of karma and I did not even recall any\r\nmistakes.  But then Angkar would say that Angkar had multiple\r\neyes like the pineapple so they never made any wrong arrests.\r\nQ. Thank you.\r\nHave you ever seen or known that at S-21 the practice of blood\r\ndrawing took place -- I mean blood drawing from detainees?\r\nA. I have no idea of that practice because when it comes to\r\ntortures, as I told you, for me I know it for sure,I was being\r\ntortured, how I was being tortured.  But for the other people,\r\nwhether their blood were being drawn or were they inflicted other\r\nkinds of tortures, it was far beyond my knowledge because it was\r\ntheir own business.  That's all.\r\nTHE INTERPRETER:\r\nThe Co-Prosecutor's mic is not activated.\r\nBY MR. SENG BUNKHEANG:\r\nQ. You said you were tortured and you were beaten until you were\r\nbleeding and that one day you were sent to be poured with salt\r\nwater.  Who actually poured such water, salty water, on you?\r\nA. When I was called to be treated upstairs when I was detained,\r\nI was called so that my wound would be treated on the second\r\nfloor.  That person was a medic who would come to distribute\r\nmedicines to sick detainees and they would give us some kind of\r\nrabbit pellet medications.  I could not even swallow that kind of\r\nmedication and they would beat me and scolded me for not being\r\nable to just swallow such a small piece of rabbit pellet\r\nmedication.\r\nQ. Thank you.\r\nWhen they were searching for a painter at that time you were\r\nbeing taken to see Duch.  When you saw him were you happy or were\r\nyou terrified?\r\nA. At that time I was so happy because I would be able to eat\r\nenough food and I told myself that it would be the moment that I\r\ncould be relieved from those kind of hell.  And then I was\r\ndetermined that I would do my best to devote myself to work with\r\nthe painting, but I was at the beginning tested.  And I would\r\nlike to go back a little bit how I was tested.\r\nBecause they wanted to know whether I was really a painter, they\r\ngave me a paper and a pencil so that I could draw.  I think that\r\nperson was smart.  Mr. Kaing Guek Eav is very smart.  His\r\neducation is much higher than me, so far as I know, and I know\r\nfor sure that he is smart and intelligent because he was the\r\nfirst-class student in mathematics.  So for me, I am just a very\r\nlittle and ordinary person.  I only know how to draw; that's all.\r\nQ. Thank you.  During the time when you were asked to paint\r\nportraits did you see any senior leaders of the Democratic\r\nKampuchea regime pay a visit to S-21?\r\nA. I used to see them but I don't remember their names.  I saw a\r\nwell-built and tall guy, taller than him.  A few people paid a\r\nvisit to the workshop.  They went there briefly and then they\r\nleft when I was still painting the portrait of Pol Pot.\r\nTHE INTERPRETER:\r\nThe Co-Prosecutor's mic is not activated.\r\nBY MR. SENG BUNKHEANG:\r\nQ. You said you have seen the Vietnamese soldiers were being\r\nwalked into the compound and you saw it through the window.  How\r\ndid you identify them as the Vietnamese soldiers?  Were they\r\nbrought in with uniforms, or what?\r\nA. I could tell that they were Vietnamese soldiers because their\r\nhats were very identical and their uniforms were different from\r\nthe black uniform worn by the Khmer Rouge soldiers, because the\r\nVietnamese soldiers would wear other like a green kind of\r\nuniform.\r\nQ. Thank you.\r\nNow I would like to move back a little bit to the time, the\r\nepisode when the accused would like to test your painting\r\nability.  How could he test you?\r\nA. As I already mentioned, I would like now to add further for\r\nfull details I may have not fully told the Court yet.  He gave me\r\na piece of paper to just make a few sketches and I -- when I was\r\nin the jungle I used to drawing pictures, and at the technical\r\nschool I was used to drawing and then he noticed that I could be\r\na good painter and he asked me what kind of equipment or tools\r\nthat I would need to make sure I could paint on a big portrait;\r\non a big board, for example, and he would go and find those tools\r\nfor me.\r\nSo he asked his subordinates to look for the tools.  At that time\r\nin Phnom Penh it would not be difficult to find those materials\r\nbecause many things were left, including the big sheet of paper.\r\nThe roll of those paper could be easily taken, and then I took a\r\nlong piece of paper about one metre and a half long and one metre\r\nwide so that I could really paint the portrait of Pol Pot on it.\r\nI did not see Pol Pot or his picture before.  I was given a small\r\nphoto of him and then the photo was put in a photo frame, and\r\nthen there was a label underneath.  It tells us about the photo\r\nshop in China.\r\nQ. Thank you.  Could you please tell us more about when you were\r\nbeing sent to S 21?  Have you ever thought that at that moment\r\nyour life would be ended although you have not made any mistakes?\r\nA. I did not think about this because for a frank, honest person\r\nlike me I did not know that I would be taken there to be killed,\r\nbecause I thought that when I could be used to work then I knew\r\nthat I could survive longer because I was very obedient to their\r\norders, assignments.  I could do whatever they wished me to do\r\nand I could paint the four portraits as requested and ordered.\r\nAnd the last portrait was missing already and I am sorry that\r\nthat painting is lost because the international community had\r\nbeen asking for such a portrait but it is gone already, and we\r\nhave a lot of people from other countries who paid a visit to\r\nTuol Sleng and they asked me about that.\r\nQ. Thank you very much.\r\nMR. SENG BUNKHEANG:\r\nMr. President, I have no further questions.  I hope my colleague\r\nwould like to make some further questions.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nThe floor is yours, the Co-Prosecutor.\r\nMR. PETIT:\r\nThank you, Mr. President.  I don't have any further questions for\r\nthe witness but with your permission I'd like to thank him for\r\nhis testimony today on behalf of the Co-Prosecutors.  Thank you.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nNext we would like to give the floor to the civil party lawyers\r\nand, according to the observation we obtained yesterday, the\r\ncivil party lawyers whose clients are to be testifying today\r\nwould get the most time.  I don't know whether they still\r\nmaintain the position or would they want to change?  Then they\r\ncould tell the Chamber to know also.\r\nMS. STUDZINSKY:\r\nThank you, Mr. President.\r\nWe would like to continue with the same procedure the whole time\r\nthis week and next week, as long as we are here as civil parties.\r\nThank you.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nNow you take the floor.\r\nMR. KONG PISEY:\r\nThank you, Mr. President, for giving me the opportunity to put\r\nquestions to the survivor of the regime, Your Honours.\r\nQUESTIONING BY CIVIL PARTY COUNSEL\r\nBY MR. KONG PISEY:\r\nQ. Good afternoon, Uncle Bou Meng.  My first question is the\r\nfollow-up question concerning the earlobes, your earlobes.  You\r\nsaid that you received tortures onto the earlobes -- no, the ears\r\nas a whole, and you said you had a hearing problem.\r\nI would like to ask whether now you can listen to people and your\r\nears are okay, or you need a hearing aid to assist you with the\r\nhearing?\r\nA. The Court officials have helped me and taken me to the\r\nhospital specializing in hearing and then they offered me a\r\nhearing aid.  I now can hear better.  If I use my bare ears to\r\nlisten to people talking I would not be able to listen or to\r\nunderstand their conversation unless I paid very close attention,\r\nor move very close to them.  So if I could put number one to 10,\r\nI could hear about 30 percent.  I mean three out of 10 because of\r\nmy impairment.  And I think my eyesight were not good.  My teeth,\r\nalso, are not good.\r\nOf course, when people get old, this kind of thing will get old\r\nas well, but you know, like, Chum Mey is still young, and I am\r\nolder than my age because I had been tortured, otherwise I would\r\nbe ok now.  And my ears would have not been that bad.  So here --\r\nI can sit here, I cannot even listen to you if you talked over\r\nthere.\r\nQ.   Thank you.  My next question.\r\nI want to know about your suffering.  How long had you endured\r\nthis suffering or you still feel the suffering at the present\r\ntime?\r\nA. Are you talking about the suffering, the physical suffering,\r\nin addition to the emotional suffering?\r\nQ. Thank you.  I meant regarding your earache.  So you suffered\r\nwhen they tortured you.  Are your ears in a better condition now?\r\nA. They are fully recovered, however, I have had hard hearing.\r\nSo that's why I need the hearing aid so that I could hear\r\nproperly.  Without the hearing aid, I could hardly hear anything.\r\nThat's all.\r\nQ. Thank you.  Regarding the electrocution, as you stated that\r\nthey used the wall power outlet to electrocute you.  You said you\r\nwere electrocuted near your genitals.  How far was the spot where\r\nit was electrocuted?\r\nA. It was to the inner side of my thigh.  So once I was\r\nelectrocuted, I fell unconscious immediately, and when I gained\r\nmy consciousness, the water was everywhere on my face.\r\nQ. Thank you.  Did they place the wire on your pants or on your\r\nflesh directly?\r\nA.  It was placed on my shorts, however, there was a machine that\r\nI think it controlled the voltage, and that machine hooked into\r\nthe power outlet from the wall.  So I think they could increase\r\nthe voltage from that machine.\r\nBut you could easily understand that if the voltage was not\r\nstrong enough, then I would not fall unconscious.  That's it.\r\nQ. Thank you.  You already informed the Chamber that once you\r\nwere electrocuted, you fell unconscious straight away.  And for\r\nhow long did you become unconscious?\r\nA. If you are unconscious, it's like you were sleeping.  You\r\nwould not know how long you fell unconscious.\r\nQ. On another matter, did you go and make consultation with the\r\npsychological support?\r\nA. Previously, I have had consultation with a psychological\r\nsupport.  I was assisted with some tablets so that I would not\r\nhave insomnia, and I take two types of tablets on a daily basis.\r\nBut when I come to the Court and speak in this current condition,\r\nI can't not even eat my lunch today because I was overwhelmed and\r\nI did not feel like eating anything.\r\nQ. Thank you.  Now, on the matter of interrogation, you stated to\r\nthe Chamber that there were five interrogators: Hor, Chan, Tith,\r\nPeng and Kuy, but you haven't clearly verified that for each\r\ninterrogation, were the five present and beating you up or were\r\nyou interrogated and tortured by only one interrogator at a time?\r\nA.   They were there during the interrogation, but only one\r\nperson beat me at a time and then they took turns.  First Chan\r\nbeat me up.  He asked me to count the number of lashes.  When I\r\ncounted up to 10 I told him, and he said, \"It's not yet 10, I\r\nonly hit you once\".  And I can remember his word.  I remember his\r\nwords, I remember his face.\r\nI can always remember his face, the person who mistreated me.  I\r\nremember both, those who did good thing and who did bad things to\r\nme.\r\nQ. Thank you.  The question is, on one day during the\r\ninterrogation, were the five interrogators beat you up on that\r\nsame day or only they came on another day?\r\nA. That group of interrogators, the five of them, they took turns\r\nto beat me up until all the five became exhausted or when the\r\ntime was up.  For example, from 7 a.m. until about 11 or 12, then\r\nthey rested.  I saw all of them.\r\nQ. So from what I can understand, you confirmed that in -- for\r\neach date, the five of them present at the same time.  Is that\r\ntrue?\r\nA. That is correct.\r\nQ. My next question.  You stated to the Chamber that when they\r\nwater-hosed you in the common room, so all the inmates had to\r\ntake off their clothes, and later on they had to dry the floor\r\nwith their shorts.\r\nThe question is, did the guards order the prisoners to take off\r\ntheir shorts or the prisoners took off their shorts by\r\nthemselves?\r\nA. I am not sure on this point.  My memory is not clear.  I can\r\nremember that all of us, 30 or 40 of us, were all naked, and I\r\neven remember one phrase.  The person was about 15 or 16 years\r\nold.  He said, \"You, you have a small build but with big\r\ngenital\".  That's what he said.  \"And this guy, you're big, but\r\nyour penis is tiny\".  That's what he said.  So they just make a\r\njoke out of us being naked.  And I still can remember what was\r\nsaid, but I can not say for sure whether we took off the pants by\r\nourselves or they ordered us to take the pants off.  I'm not sure\r\nbecause probably they ordered us to take the pants off so they\r\ncan joke about our genitals.\r\nQ. Thank you.\r\nSo for every time you were water-hosed, were all of you had to be\r\nnaked?\r\nA. Yes, we all had to be naked.  I looked around.  Nobody had\r\nunderwear or pants on them.  People were like animals from hell,\r\nall naked.  Because they treated us as enemies, as traitors, they\r\nwater-hosed us from outside so the water was everywhere in the\r\ncommon room.  So then we tried to dry the floor with our pants\r\nuntil the floor was completely dry.  Then we could lie down on\r\nthe floor again.\r\nAnd we all of us had skin rashes and a lot of skin lice.  It was\r\nso itchy everywhere.  I think it was Nhem En (phonetic) who\r\nwanted to find a cure, a treatment for skin rash and itch, and\r\nafter that it was better.  Let me say, only the guards who could\r\nable to find that traditional medicines to help us with the\r\nitches and the skin rash.\r\nQ. So when you were water-hosed, were you provided any soap?\r\nA. No, there was no soap or nothing to scrub our body.  We were\r\nwashed like pigs were washed.  Because I used to raise pigs, when\r\nI washed my pigs, then I water-hosed my pigs and I used my hands\r\nto clean my pigs.  But I was even lower than my pigs or my dog\r\nbecause no soap was used, no scarf was used to change or dry my\r\nbody.\r\nQ. Thank you.\r\nRegarding the common room, did you ever see the prisoners who\r\nwere taken out and when they returned, did you see any wound or\r\nmarks on their bodies?\r\nA. It seems that I did not see such incidents.  I was not sure.\r\nBecause maybe they were in the same way like I was there, it\r\nmeans after the interrogation and the torture, they would be\r\ntaken to the individual cells so that those in the common room\r\nwould not know that we were being tortured.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nThe Chamber will take a break now for 17 minutes and we will\r\nresume at 3 p.m.\r\nCourt Official, please arrange refreshment for the witness.\r\n(Judges exit courtroom)\r\n(Court recesses from 1442H to 1500H)\r\n(Judges enter courtroom)\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nPlease be seated.  The Chamber is now back in session.\r\nI would like, now, to give the floor to the civil party lawyer to\r\ncontinue the questions to be put to Bou Meng, the survivor -- one\r\nof the three survivors from the S-21 office.\r\nMR. KONG PISEY:\r\nThank you again, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.\r\nNow, I'll continue my questions to the civil party and the\r\nsurvivor of S-21 office.\r\nBY MR. KONG PISEY:\r\nQ. You already stated to the Chamber that you saw female guards\r\nwalking pregnant prisoners.  And the question is, where did you\r\nsee the pregnant prisoners being walked; from which direction to\r\nwhich direction?\r\nA. Mr. Lawyer, when I looked to the east direction, the canvas\r\nwas propped against the window and through the door, I could see\r\na pregnant woman being walked and kicked and I did not look for\r\nlong.  I did not know whether that pregnant woman fell on the\r\nground and got up or walked again because I only had a quick look\r\nin that direction and that was what I saw.\r\nQ. Thank you.\r\nSo how many pregnant woman did you see and how many female guards\r\ndid you see?\r\nA. There was only one pregnant woman and there were two or three\r\nfemale guards\r\nwalking behind.\r\nThat's all.\r\nQ. Can you confirm whether she was kicked from behind or she was\r\nhit?\r\nA. They were female guards so they kicked her from behind because\r\nthat female -- that pregnant woman did not walk quickly enough.\r\nSo because, probably, she was in a state of fear as it was --\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nUncle Meng, please you respond only when you see the red light so\r\nthat the interpreter can listen fully; otherwise, the\r\ninternational judges and participants would not be able to hear\r\nwhat you say.  Of course, you would wish your statements to be\r\nheard by both Cambodian people and the international participants\r\nand both on the radio and on the TV so that the whole world can\r\nsee and hear what you said.\r\nMR. KONG PISEY:\r\nI no longer have questions, Mr. President, and I would like Your\r\nHonour's permission to permit Bou Meng to ask questions to the\r\naccused through you.\r\nThank you.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nI would like, now, to give the floor to the next lawyer for\r\ncivil party; the lawyer for Group 1.\r\nMS. TY SRINNA:\r\nThank you, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.\r\nBY MS. TY SRINNA:\r\nQ.  Good afternoon, Uncle Bou Meng.  I have some questions for\r\nyou.  Please answer\r\nbriefly to my questions due to the time and location for the\r\ncivil party lawyers.  Thank you.\r\nFrom the time you arrived at S-21, you were tortured in order to\r\nextract your confession.  How long were you tortured?\r\nA. Miss Lawyer, I am really not clear on the total period of\r\nbeing interrogated; however, it was several months or several\r\nweeks, I think.  But being detained there from when I was healthy\r\nuntil I was so skinny; it was quite a long time.\r\nIt was common when we still had full strengths, but once we\r\nbecame weak they would start to peel our skin.  That expression\r\nmeans they would start to interrogate and torture us.\r\nQ. Thank you.\r\nMy second question; on the 7 January 1979, at that time, you left\r\nS-21 office and there were security guards from S-21 office who\r\nforced you to go along with them.  Do you or can you recall the\r\nnames of those guards and how many of them?\r\nA. Ms. Lawyer, I cannot recall the number of the guards; however,\r\nI clearly remember that I was walked from Tuol Sleng toward the\r\nChamkar Duong area.\r\nHowever, when we left Tuol Sleng, we stayed in a house until it\r\nwas dusk, then we continued our journey toward the direction of\r\nChamkar Duong.  I still cannot recall the number of the guards.\r\nI was so fearful at the time I didn't know where they took me.\r\nSo I cannot recall the number, but they were armed.\r\nQ. Thank you.\r\nAnd what about the names of the guards; do you know their names?\r\nA. I only remember the names of the interrogators.  I could not\r\nrecall the names of the guards.\r\nQ. Thank you.\r\nMy last question:  at that time, you heard the sound of the\r\ntrucks coming in and going out, taking the prisoners in and out,\r\nday and night.  When you heard the sound of the vehicles, was it\r\nfrom the east or from the west entrance?  Please can you try to\r\nrecall?  It's okay if you cannot remember.\r\nA. From my recollection, although I must admit I am forgetful, it\r\nwas common for the vehicle coming in and going out.  However I\r\ndid not know when the car going out -- I'm not sure where it went\r\nto, I only heard the sound.  And at that time I was a prisoner\r\nbeing detained in the individual cell, and the car sound coming\r\nfrom the front of the Tuol Sleng prison.\r\nQ. Now, previously I thought that this is my last question, but\r\nnow I have another question based on the request from my\r\ncolleague.\r\nYou said you heard the screaming of the victims -- that is the\r\nscreaming of the prisoners at S-21.  When you heard such\r\nscreaming, was the accused, the prison chief, was there with you?\r\nA. While I was sleeping in Building C on the third floor in the\r\ncommon room, at night I heard the screaming.  I think probably\r\nthe screaming was a result of the person being interrogated and\r\ntortured.\r\nTo me it seems the screaming was echoing and coming from\r\neverywhere at the surrounding vicinity of Tuol Sleng prison,\r\nprobably because during that time those houses around Tuol Sleng\r\nwere used as the interrogation houses.\r\nBut now all those houses are gone, even the house where I was\r\ninterrogated behind Building A outside the compound also\r\ndisappears now.  I could not recognize it any more.  That's all.\r\nMS. TY SRINNA:\r\nI have no more questions for you and thank you for answering the\r\nquestions.\r\nThank you, Mr. President.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nNow the floor is given to the next civil party lawyer.  You take\r\nthe floor.\r\nMS. JACQUIN:\r\nGood afternoon, Your Honours.\r\nBY MS. JACQUIN:\r\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. Bou Meng.  These are my questions to you.\r\nFirst of all, you stated that in the common room there were\r\nforeign prisoners or people who looked foreign, westerners.  Were\r\nthey taken away while you were still in that room or were they\r\nstill in that room at the time when you were taken away from that\r\nroom?\r\nA. Ms. Lawyer, when I saw them they were westerners or we say\r\nEuropeans.  They had light complexion and blond hair.  Of course\r\nI did not know their nationality.  I saw them for only a short\r\nperiod of time and then they disappeared.  They were there for\r\nprobably two weeks being detained on that floor of Building C.\r\nSo after about two weeks they disappeared and I didn't know where\r\nthey were taken to.  That's all.\r\nQ. Thank you.\r\nYou stated that you saw Vietnamese soldiers in uniform;\r\nconsequently, you were quite sure that they were indeed\r\nVietnamese soldiers, beyond doubt.\r\nA. Let me tell you, Ms. Lawyer, those Vietnamese soldiers,\r\nbecause they wore a different uniform, military uniform,\r\ndifferent from the Khmer Rouge military uniforms, that uniform\r\nwas similar to the Chinese soldier uniform.  They had a khaki\r\ncolour and they had their rank displayed and they wore the type\r\nof helmet.  That's what led to my conclusion.  That's all.\r\nQ. I'm asking this question because there seems to be something\r\nambiguous in your response unless I have misunderstood.\r\nWould these Vietnamese soldiers have been soldiers who retained\r\ntheir uniforms, or were these Vietnamese soldiers partners of the\r\nKhmer Rouge as guards and organizers of the prison?\r\nA. Ms. Lawyer, it is my personal view that they were real\r\nsoldiers, they were not fake.  So it was the real military\r\nuniform, although some uniforms were rather old.  That is all.\r\nQ. So you confirm that those soldiers did not have a status of\r\nprisoners?\r\nA. I was wondering, for example, like when Kaing Guek Eav, alias\r\nDuch, said when you were sent there you would be treated as the\r\nenemy regardless you were civilians or soldiers, you were all\r\nregarded as the enemy.\r\nQ. Furthermore, you have stated that you saw a number of guards\r\nwho were 15 or 16 years old.  They were mere teenagers.  Have you\r\nseen guards who were younger than that still, who would have\r\nbeen, let's say, 10 or 12 years old?\r\nA. I did not see any guards who were 15 or under, unless I was\r\nmistaken.  Usually they were 15 or above.  That was through my\r\nobservation at the time.  That's all.\r\nQ. Thank you.  And I have two personal questions for you now.\r\nDo you feel bad about having signed the confession that you had\r\nto sign because of duress, whereas you knew that this confession,\r\nthe content of it, was false?\r\nA. Ms. Lawyer, at that time my emotion was mixed.  I was fearful,\r\nworried; I could not describe the emotion.  So I just did what I\r\nwas ordered to do because there was absolutely no reason for them\r\nto suspect me to be a CIA or KGB agent, and I was tortured\r\nenough.\r\nSome prisoners, when they were tortured and interrogated, they\r\nconfessed and finally they were taken and smashed, but for me I\r\nwas different.  Of course physically I signed the confession but\r\ninside my heart I of course did not approve the confession.\r\nQ. I'm sure nobody would challenge that, sir.\r\nAnother question.  Within the workshop amongst the sculptors,\r\npainters, artists would you amongst yourselves talk at all about\r\nthe tortures that you had been subjected to and the confessions\r\nthat you were forced to sign?  Did you talk about these things\r\namongst yourselves within the workshop?\r\nA. Ms. Lawyer, I never talked about that.  The reason is because\r\nI was scared.  Usually there were two or three prison guards who\r\nwere there constantly and the door was locked both inside and\r\noutside, so if we whispered or chit-chatted on this thing then\r\nit's so risky.\r\nQ. One last question.  Today how do you feel about the fact that\r\nyou are a survivor?\r\nA. Ms. Lawyer, I am so delighted that now my chest seems to be\r\nlighter.  All my statements to the Judges and to the lawyers and\r\nthe rest, I felt much better now and I believed through peace and\r\njustice would be done for those 1.8 or two million people who\r\nlost their lives during that regime, and I myself too, I was a\r\nvictim and the scope of suffering was incalculable.  I was almost\r\nkilled.  My back was wounded severely and still I could carry out\r\nmy profession, painting the portraits to satisfy the chief of the\r\nprison.\r\nBut it was shameful that I could not save the life of my wife.\r\nI'm not sure if it was my mistake or not and I really want to ask\r\nthe accused where was my wife killed.  If I know where it is then\r\nI would go there in order to pray for her soul, and that I am now\r\nbeing testified before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Court of\r\nCambodia, only the spirit of the earth would know where the soul\r\nhas gone to or where the dead bodies were buried.  So only the\r\nspirits of the wind, of the water, of the earth would know.\r\nAnd for those who killed the people, they could tell the truth or\r\nthey could lie, but only the spirits of the earth, the wind and\r\nthe water know where my wife died, so that I could pray for her\r\nsoul.  That is all.\r\nMS. JACQUIN:\r\nThank you, Mr. Bou Meng.\r\nMr. President, on behalf of all the civil party groups, we have a\r\nrequest to put to you.  We would like to ask for 10 extra\r\nminutes.  There are seven lawyers present here representing 90\r\nvictims.  All of these victims are important.  If we are to share\r\nout this time it would amount to one half-minute per victim, but\r\nwe have legitimate questions to put.\r\nSir, you have been showing tolerance in interpreting the time\r\nallowance and we are grateful for this.  However, we have all\r\nsorts of time management problems.  If you could assure us that\r\nwe have could have, if need be, an extra 10 minutes, this would\r\nmake it possible for us to work amongst ourselves more\r\nharmoniously.\r\nThank you.\r\nMS. CANIZARES:\r\nMr. President, if extra time were to be granted to the\r\nrepresentatives of the civil parties would it be possible to have\r\nextra time, if necessary, for the defence to ask questions?\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nIn order not to complicate the matter regarding the request by\r\nboth sides and the civil party lawyers use the time as allocated\r\nby the Chamber, however, the Chamber will not allow extra time\r\nand the time has run out already.\r\nNow I would give the opportunity to the survivor, Bou Meng.\r\nUncle Bou Meng, do you have any questions that you would like to\r\nask the accused at the moment?\r\nMR. BOU MENG:\r\nMr. President, I would like to ask him where did he smash my\r\nwife; whether it was at Tuol Sleng or Choeung Ek or at another\r\nlocation.\r\nDid you have the authority to relocate her or to smash her?  It\r\nhas been so many years already.  I went to her native village in\r\nTboung Khmum district in Kampong Cham province.   I went to ask\r\nher elder sibling whether my wife has ever returned to the\r\nvillage and the response was no.  So I presumed that she was\r\nkilled while she was detained.\r\nAnd my question is just to tell me, just to tell me where she was\r\nkilled or smashed.  Then I would go to that location and just to\r\nget the soil from that location to pray for her soul because\r\nthere was not her document at the S-21 Office.  I used to have\r\nsome documents as well, but some of the documents I have I have\r\nlost or are missing.  And I want the matter to be done legally.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nCan you verify that your wife, who was detained at S-21 with you,\r\nher name was Ma Yoeun alias Thy.  Is that correct?\r\nMR. BOU MENG:\r\nThat is correct, Mr. President.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nMr. Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, the first question is, do you\r\nknow Ma Yoeun alias Thy?  If you know her, could you answer to\r\nhis question that when you were the chairman of S-21 and that his\r\nwife was taken away to be executed, where was she killed?  In\r\nPhnom Penh or at Choeung Ek?\r\nTHE ACCUSED:\r\nMr. President, thank you, Mr. President for giving me the\r\nopportunity to respond to the question.\r\nMr. Meng, especially for you I have been moved.  We have lived\r\ntogether and you were healthy and I was shocked to see you on the\r\n28th of February 2008 before the Co-Investigating Judges.  I\r\nwould like to respond to your desire, but it was beyond my\r\ncapacity because this work done by my subordinates, but I would\r\nlike to presume that your wife might have been killed at Boeng\r\nChoeung Ek.\r\nMeanwhile, to be sure, I would like to ask you to please ask\r\nComrade Huy who may be able to tell you further detail about the\r\nfate of your wife.  Please accept my highest assurance of my\r\nregards and respects towards the soul of your wife.  That's all.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nThe accused, please control your emotion and re-compose because\r\nthe moment is important that it takes time to listen to the\r\ntestimony of the survivors who have survived the regime and to\r\nrecall the past.\r\nSo, Uncle Bou Meng, I hope you have already been told by the\r\naccused about the fate of your wife because his conclusion is\r\nthat she could have been killed at Boeng Choeung Ek, especially\r\nwhen it comes to the time when she was sent in during the year of\r\n1977.\r\nAt the beginning, the killing would take place only at the\r\npremises of Tuol Sleng compound and later on, after 1977 to '78,\r\nthen the execution sites had been shifted to Choeung Ek.  So it\r\ncould be possible that the fate of your wife would be ended there\r\nat Choeung Ek or she would be killed there.\r\nAnd to get further information, it is rather difficult because\r\nthe people who perished amounted to more than 12,000, and those\r\nmore than 12,000 were registered and there were still numbers of\r\ndetainees who are still unaccounted for.  At the beginning, we\r\nknow that there would have been 12,300 or something detainees,\r\nbut after inspecting the list and compared with other lists, then\r\nwe could see more numbers, different numbers of the people killed\r\nduring that time.  But I think the actual number of people who\r\nwould have been killed would be even higher if all documents\r\ncould be supported.\r\nNext, the accused, besides your response to Uncle Bou Meng, one\r\nof the survivors who asked you about the fate of his wife, the\r\nChamber would like to also know whether the accused would like to\r\nmake any comments or observations, testimony, concerning the\r\nremarks or testimony of Uncle Bou Meng.  So you are now given the\r\nopportunity to do so if you would wish.\r\nTHE ACCUSED:\r\nMr. President, first, I would like to confirm to Mr. Bou Meng and\r\nthe other victims.  He keep asking what kind of mistakes he had\r\ncommitted; what kind of mistake his wife committed that led to\r\ntheir arrest.\r\nFrankly, during that time, I already -- I think yesterday I told\r\nBrother Mey already -- anyone who opposed them would be singled\r\nout as the CIA, the KGB, or the expansionist, so on and so forth.\r\nSo I would like just to repeat it and to be more precise.\r\nI would like to state that the Cultural Revolution of China would\r\nbe seen as the reference.  Although Pol Pot did not follow\r\nexactly that kind of philosophy, he used his own improvised\r\ntheory, so he would implicate anyone as an enemy.\r\nAnd I told Brother Mey already about the CIA.  He asked me\r\nwhether CIA or KGB agents have already been smashed and I told\r\nhim that anyone who opposes the Pol Pot were those who have\r\ndefeated the Pol Pot regime.\r\nAnd, after all, the fascist political politics ended on January\r\n1979, so the reason why people were implicated or opponents, this\r\nlead to the destruction of the whole regime, and I would like to\r\nemphasize again that this crime is so severe, although it was\r\ncommitted by the upper echelon.  But members of the Party were\r\npart of the process all across the country, because more than one\r\nmillion people were executed, and emotionally I am responsible\r\nfor all the crimes, although they were committed by the senior\r\npeople.\r\nI am responsible in the eyes of the law, and I now would like to\r\nbe tried by the ECCC alone, and I don't want my subordinates to\r\nbe on trial too.  And I have already dedicated -- I have already\r\nprayed for the souls of the dead people to rest in peace.  I'm\r\nnot talking here to evade the responsibility of my crimes but I\r\nwant to reveal my frankness.  That's all.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nNext we would like to give the floor to the defence counsel to\r\nhave the opportunity to put questions to Uncle Bou Meng, one of\r\nthe survivors of S-21.\r\nThe floor is yours, if you would wish to do so.\r\nMR. KAR SAVUTH:\r\nThank you, Mr. President.  Your Honours, my questions here are\r\nfirst I would like Mr. Bou Meng to clarify on some points because\r\nI have been ambivalent regarding those points.\r\nQUESTIONING BY DEFENCE COUNSEL\r\nBY MR. KAR SAVUTH:\r\nQ. When you were detained at S-21 did you hear the cries, the\r\nweeps or screams of people in the compound?  Because this\r\nmorning, before we adjourned for lunch, you said that there were\r\nfull -- everyone was quiet and people could not even whisper to\r\none another.  So I think your testimony in the morning seems to\r\nbe contradictory to your testimony in the afternoon.  Could you\r\nplease repeat or confirm your both testimonies?\r\nA. I said it was very quiet because the doors were all shut when\r\nI left, evacuated.  I did not have a chance to look inside the\r\nrooms because I were at -- I was walked away at gunpoint and I\r\nwas not brave enough to even look back to see how many people\r\nwould be in the room.  That's why I said it was quiet.\r\nAnd I think regarding the screams, the cries, I knew that my ears\r\nwere too good to listen to those noises because I was also a very\r\ngood artist.  Having heard the sound, I could even draft or\r\nsketch a kind of portrait, so I think I was not mistaken to hear\r\nthose screams during the time when I was detained.\r\nQ. Thank you.  Could you please emphasize again: you said that\r\nbefore the morning break, you said that the building was full of\r\npeople.  And you said that the building was full of detainees but\r\nit was so quiet because people could not even whisper into the\r\nears of the neighbours.  But how could you say that you heard the\r\nscreams, the cries that people cried for help?  I don't want you\r\nto tell us about the time when you were about to leave S-21.\r\nA. I would like to state that when I was inside the detention\r\ncentre, around the compound there were a lot of interrogating\r\nhouses.  And inside the room, of course, you could not hear\r\nanyone scream or cry because we would be punished.  But I'm\r\ntalking about the people who would be taken away to be\r\ninterrogated inside those houses, and we could hear from the\r\nhouses.  I'm not here to talk and to implicate anyone.  I'm\r\ntalking here, right before the iron genie, and if I talked\r\nsomething, exaggerating anything, then I would be run over by a\r\nbus.\r\nQ. Thank you.  I would like you to only confirm.  Number two, I\r\nwould like your confirmation also.  You said the subordinates of\r\nDuch, who treated the Vietnamese prisoner who did not keep his\r\npromise that he was a sculptor, and that you said Duch ordered\r\nhis subordinate to kick or to torture him but later on you said\r\nthat Duch was not there when his subordinates tortured him.  So\r\ncould you please tell us whether Duch was there when the torture\r\ntook place?\r\nA. Mr. Lawyer, I said, my memory is not good.  And I said clearly\r\nthat it is because I have had been severely tortured, and I don't\r\nwant to evade any responses but if I made any mistake in my\r\ntestimony it is resulted from the very poor memory of mine;\r\nresulted, of course, from such torture.  So I think my memory is\r\nnow about\r\nto 20 percent good, compared to the 100 percent I           10   could have had previously.\r\nBY MR. PRESIDENT:\r\nQ. Uncle Meng, could you please control your emotion?  I know\r\nthat you have been bombarded with questions, and you have been\r\nanswering to those questions for almost the whole day already.\r\nWe would like you to please recompose yourself.\r\nAnd the question is implied as, have you heard that Duch ordered\r\nhis subordinates to beat the Vietnamese detainee?  And some said\r\nthat he was the Khmer Krom national who pretended to be a good\r\nsculptor.  So the question is whether Duch did order such torture\r\nor punishment to be inflicted on that person, or Duch\r\nsubordinates initiated such ideas of punishment spontaneously,\r\nbecause there was a torture inflicted on that person; so whether\r\nit was ordered or not ordered by Duch.  Could you please verify?\r\nA. I did not see or hear it.  That's why I cannot presume that he\r\nordered his subordinates to do that.  Or maybe his subordinates\r\njust did that by themselves.  I can say that without any order\r\nfrom their subordinates I don't even think that their\r\nsubordinates could inflict any kind of tortures on them - on\r\nanyone.  So I could see that, after their work, they covered --\r\nyou know, like, when they treated their staff, they would cover\r\nthe blankets all over their body and walk them away because they\r\nwere afraid to let us know.  I don't know, but I think it is just\r\nmy presumption.\r\nQ. I think you probably be confused.  You are the survivor of\r\nthat regime and that it is,\r\nof course, in your testimony reflecting your emotion and your\r\nstory and how you have suffered and, also, you have told us about\r\nyour wife's story.\r\nBut now we have another matter that we would like to ask about\r\nyour testimony concerning the accused because a witness is not\r\nsupposed to give a kind of presumption because it is not really\r\nappropriate.  Because in the name of the witness, if the question\r\nis put to you whether you say that you saw it or you didn't see\r\nit, you should just say \"yes\" or \"no\" and please try to avoid\r\ngiving your presumption or your -- some kind of conclusion\r\nbecause the term \"conclusion\" is not aimed to be coming from the\r\nwitness.\r\nA. At that time, I'm not sure so I would like to say that I don't\r\nknow, but I saw the person was being kicked and beat up.  I don't\r\nknow who ordered them to do so.  That's all.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nCould the lawyer put further questions?\r\nBY MR. KAR SAVUTH:\r\nQ. Thank you, Mr. Bou Meng.\r\nThe third question.  When you were arrested all together with\r\nyour wife from the cooperative to be put at wooden shed right in\r\nfront of the prison, were you shackled by your ankles?\r\nA. At that time, they treated me better because they used the\r\nvery cold method because there were no cuffs, no chain, no\r\nshackles.  They mislead me. They lied to me because they did not\r\nactually take me to the Fine Arts School.  It was the fine arts\r\nschool of Tuol Sleng prison, so they cheated on me.  I could just\r\neasily be convinced to climb onto the truck and then be taken\r\naway and then they did not take me to the Fine Arts School.\r\nInstead, we were taken to the prison.\r\nQ. Thank you.  The reason I asked you that question to confirm\r\nyour statement because your statement before the Co-Prosecutor on\r\nthe 29 of August 2006 in ERN-00145528, you said you were\r\nhandcuffed and shackles; both your wife and you.  And this\r\nmorning, you said that only your hands were cuffed and that your\r\nlegs were free from being shackled.\r\nAnd as you said, you are old and you had been tortured; your\r\nmemory deteriorating.  I think everyone can forget except the God\r\nwho is able to remember everything.  Human being will be\r\nforgetful anyway.  Thank you.\r\nQuestion number four.  Your statement before the Co-Prosecutors\r\n-- and you said later, \"I learned that I was taken -- prisoners\r\nwere taken to be executed at Choeung Ek, days and nights\".  Do\r\nyou maintain that your statement is still confirmed?\r\nA. Mr. Lawyer, I did say that there were trucks which brought\r\npeople in and out, but I\r\ndid not say that they would be taken away to be killed.  I didn't\r\nsay that.\r\nMR. HONG KIMSUON:\r\nCould you please repeat the ERN number?\r\nMR. KAR SAVUTH:\r\nERN 00145533, the fourth line from down up.\r\nBY MR. KAR SAVUTH:\r\nQ. \"And later on, I learned that they were carried or taken to be\r\nexecuted at Choeung Ek and the truck would take them days and\r\nnights.\"\r\nThat's why I am asking whether you maintain your statement or\r\nwould you like to change it because some witnesses said that they\r\nonly saw the prisoner being carried away by trucks at night, not\r\nduring the daytimes.  Thank you.\r\nA. When I was detained in Building C, I heard the sound of the\r\ntrucks during the\r\nnights and days.  I don't know whatever other people would\r\ntestify, but this is what I have heard because there were trucks\r\ncoming in and going out.  I don't know where people would be\r\ntaken to, but I have heard the noises.  I did not see the trucks.\r\nI think the trucks would have been parked right in front of the\r\nentrance to the east or maybe to the west; let me recall it.\r\nI had been working at the premises for some time.  I still cannot\r\nremember whether Tuol Sleng entrance would be to the east or to\r\nthe west, but I think the trucks would be parking somewhere near\r\nthe entrance when I was walked into the premises during the first\r\ntime when we were approaching the location and, again, I did not\r\n-- or I don't know whether people would be taken away to be\r\nexecuted.\r\nQ. Thank you.  Question number five.\r\nWhen leaving S-21, did you go with Vann Nath and Chum Mey or did\r\nyou go with other people?  Could you please recall the people?\r\nA. We left with the survivors who were either sculptor, painter,\r\nartist. I paint a black and white portrait while Nath paints\r\ncoloured, and we have other artists who also left at that time --\r\nPha Tha Chan, Oeng Bech -- so altogether about more than 10\r\npeople who would be leaving the location but many of whom have\r\ndied already, including Grandfather Thuon.\r\nSo I, of course, left with several other people and when we\r\nreached the area near Ang Snuol we departed, were separated\r\nbecause we heard the sound of the trucks of the United Front army\r\nand then there were exchanges of fire between the soldiers, and\r\nthen we were scattered and I walked across National Road Number\r\n4.\r\nQ. Thank you.  I just want to know when you left, you left along\r\nwith Chum Mey and Vann Nath.\r\nAnd my next question is I just want the confirmation.  This\r\nmorning you said when you fled S-21, one time you said it was at\r\n6 p.m. and the other time you said at 9 a.m.  And when Ty Srinna\r\nasked you, you said you went at about 6 or 7 p.m.  So can you\r\ntell me exactly what time you left S-21?\r\nA. Mr. Defence Counsel, I left Tuol Sleng prison at 9 o'clock.\r\nWe left the painting workshop and we were ordered to walk\r\nstraight in one line.  We were so fearful, so we walked in one\r\nline and when we reached a house we stopped and stayed there for\r\nquite a while.  I cannot recall the location.  Maybe it's the\r\nBeehive radio station.\r\nQ. I just want to know the time.  So you say now it's at 9\r\no'clock in the morning.\r\nAnd my seventh question, which is the last question; when you\r\nwere painting the portrait did you ever see Khieu Samphan coming\r\nto visit?\r\nA. Mr. Defence Counsel, I never saw Khieu Samphan come in.  All\r\nthose senior peoples, I never saw them.  Even Pol Pot, I only saw\r\nhis photo; I never saw him in person.  Sometimes people ask\r\nwhether I saw Pol Pot personally because I painted his portrait.\r\nIn fact I never saw him in person.  I also had my portrait\r\npainted for a Chinese shop in Shanghai.\r\nQ. Thank you.  So when you painted the portrait at the technical\r\nschool did Khieu Samphan ever go there?\r\nA. Mr. Defence Counsel, I can recall when you ask me that\r\nquestion because I worked there.  At that time I was preparing\r\nthe numbers of the pages and Mr. Khieu Samphan asked me, \"Do you\r\nhave a telephone?\" and then I told him and I pointed -- oh, the\r\ntelephone was at the corner, because I didn't know that he was\r\nKhieu Samphan.  But when he left, my work colleague told me that,\r\n\"That was Khieu Samphan,\" and I felt rather surprised.  So now I\r\ncan recall.\r\nQ. Thank you.\r\nMR. KAR SAVUTH:\r\nI have no questions, Mr. President.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nThe international defence counsel, if you have questions for Bou\r\nMeng the floor is yours.\r\nMS. CANIZARES:\r\nThank you very much, Mr. President.\r\nBY MS. CANIZARES:\r\nQ. Good evening, Mr. Bou Meng.  Judge Lavergne brought up earlier\r\non the fact that when you were working in the CPK propaganda\r\nservice, which was at the Russei Keo, you were somebody who was\r\nvery obedient.  And if I've understood correctly, you indicated\r\nthat you followed along physically but not emotionally.  Could\r\nyou please develop this assertion, this idea?\r\nA. Ms. Defence Counsel, the work that was assigned to me by Hak\r\nto draw sketches of the machines, of the half a machine or of the\r\nnew spare parts, or the sketches of vehicle machines, all types\r\nof machinery, I drew all those sketches to include in the book\r\nfor the students to study at that time.\r\nMy recollection in making that document for those technical\r\nschool participants, that was what I did.  Of course I obeyed the\r\norder from the upper echelon and my superior, Hak, assigned me to\r\nmake or compile those documents.  That is all my answer.\r\nQ. Could you please tell us why emotionally you said that you\r\ndidn't follow along?  I understood that you were just obeying to\r\nan order, so therefore of course you were obeying physically, we\r\ncould say, but why do you state that you did not obey\r\nemotionally?\r\nA. On this matter let me tell you, Ms. Defence Counsel,\r\nphysically I followed the assignment and, as my skill was in\r\ndrawing sketches, I just did it.  But in my mind I did not have\r\n100 percent confidence and trust in the leadership, and the\r\nreason?  Because I saw people being evacuated from the city, and\r\nthe city became like a ghost city.  And this is my response to\r\nyou.\r\nQ. This will be my last question.  So why, therefore, did you\r\ncontinue obeying physically?\r\nA. Ms. Defence Counsel, regarding my assignment as a painter or a\r\nsketch drawer, I had to do it.  I had to carry out my task and\r\neven if I completed and carried out my task 100 percent, I was\r\nstill being transferred.\r\nSo I was transferred to the Ta Lei Co-operative and that act made\r\nme lost my trust in that regime.\r\nQ. Given the answer, would you please give me the leave for\r\nanother question?  Therefore, could I understand that it was\r\nbecause you were afraid that you continued obeying physically?\r\nA. I don't really understand your question.  Can you ask the\r\nquestion again?\r\nQ. You are telling us that if you did not follow the orders 100\r\npercent that were given to you that you could be transferred.  So\r\ntherefore can I conclude from this answer that it was fear that\r\nmade you follow 100 percent the orders that were given to you?\r\nA. In fact, that was the case.\r\nMS. CANIZARES:\r\nI no longer have any further questions.\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\nThe hearing of the testimony of the survivor, Bou Meng, that has\r\nbeen for the whole day has now come to an end.\r\nBefore I adjourn the hearing, the Chamber would like to inform\r\nthe parties that the Chamber has a schedule for tomorrow's\r\nhearing.  According to the planned schedule, the Chamber will\r\nhear testimony of survivor CP1/6.  However, due to the time\r\ncalculation and the fact that that survivor was involved, the\r\nduration of the testimony would be not more than half a day or\r\njust a little bit over half a day.\r\nTherefore, the Chamber decides to invite another survivor, E2/80.\r\nIf there is remaining time left, then we would hear the testimony\r\nof this stand-by survivor, E2/80 from the civil party Group 3.\r\nSo this amendment of the schedule is as I've described and in\r\nfact the E2/61 was to schedule after the survivor CP1/6.\r\nHowever, due to the distance of the long residence and that we do\r\nnot hold hearings on the Thursday and Friday, then we decided to\r\nmake this change.\r\nAnd now today's hearing is adjourned.  The Chamber will resume\r\ntomorrow morning at 9 a.m. as scheduled.\r\nCourt Officer, please make necessary arrangements for Mr. Bou\r\nMeng to return to his residence by appropriate means by working\r\nin coordination with WESU.\r\nSecurity Officers, take the accused back to the detention\r\nfacility and bring him back here before 9 a.m.\r\nThe Court is adjourned.\r\n(Judges exit
