[Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some</P>\n","<P>22    questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian</P>\n","<P>23    indictment, that have to do with the \"Rump Presidency\" as it's called</P>\n","<P>24    here.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  \"The Rump Presidency</P>\n","<P>25    carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies,\" and so on and so forth, \"had</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43649 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    effect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief.\"</P>\n","<P> 2            I'm not going to ask you to repeat what you've already said, but</P>\n","<P> 3    in relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of</P>\n","<P> 4    Serbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they</P>\n","<P> 5    not take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency</P>\n","<P> 6    of the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any</P>\n","<P> 7    objective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from</P>\n","<P> 8    carrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?</P>\n","<P> 9            The question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,</P>\n","<P>10    Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the</P>\n","<P>11    SFRY Presidency in Belgrade?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,</P>\n","<P>13    staying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was</P>\n","<P>14    never a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from</P>\n","<P>15    carrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped</P>\n","<P>16    coming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had</P>\n","<P>17    practically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe</P>\n","<P>18    Mesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying</P>\n","<P>19    that they could not come because they could not strike a balance in</P>\n","<P>20    relation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and</P>\n","<P>21    Montenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.</P>\n","<P>22            The representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were</P>\n","<P>23    not expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was</P>\n","<P>24    actually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display</P>\n","<P>25    such feelings at the time.  It's only when he left Belgrade and when he</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43650 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    came back to the Croatian parliament that he said, \"I've completed my</P>\n","<P> 2    duty.  Yugoslavia is no more.\"</P>\n","<P> 3            He pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.</P>\n","<P> 4    Also, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him</P>\n","<P> 5    sufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he</P>\n","<P> 6    condemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most</P>\n","<P> 7    cooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was</P>\n","<P> 8    what he was.</P>\n","<P> 9            I already said that according to the constitution of the then</P>\n","<P>10    Yugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one</P>\n","<P>11    single member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been</P>\n","<P>12    prevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could</P>\n","<P>13    have gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could</P>\n","<P>14    have refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the</P>\n","<P>15    Presidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the</P>\n","<P>16    Presidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed</P>\n","<P>17    within the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably</P>\n","<P>18    before Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a</P>\n","<P>19    Rump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of</P>\n","<P>20    a rump Presidency.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  \"Slobodan Milosevic,</P>\n","<P>24    in his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that</P>\n","<P>25    Yugoslavia was finished.\"</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43651 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            Please, you've got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I'm not</P>\n","<P> 2    going to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much</P>\n","<P> 3    time.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to</P>\n","<P> 4    here or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that</P>\n","<P> 5    Yugoslavia was finished?</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say</P>\n","<P> 7    that Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you</P>\n","<P> 8    never said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I</P>\n","<P> 9    remember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the</P>\n","<P>10    behaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went</P>\n","<P>11    through a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,</P>\n","<P>12    constitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,</P>\n","<P>13    but then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional</P>\n","<P>14    provision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases</P>\n","<P>15    to exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the</P>\n","<P>16    matter.</P>\n","<P>17            The leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never</P>\n","<P>18    did it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and</P>\n","<P>19    Croatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and</P>\n","<P>20    Macedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro</P>\n","<P>21    proclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting</P>\n","<P>22    of two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration</P>\n","<P>23    on your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43652 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   \"In March 1991 the collective Presidency of the SFRY reached a</P>\n","<P> 2    deadlock on several issues.\"  That is paragraph 56.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... that sentence</P>\n","<P> 4    which is at the beginning of the paragraph.  There's another allegation in</P>\n","<P> 5    that last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no</P>\n","<P> 6    longer be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask</P>\n","<P> 7    Mr. Seselj whether that is so.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember</P>\n","<P> 9    at that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian</P>\n","<P>10    public, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the</P>\n","<P>11    decisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that</P>\n","<P>12    Serbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation</P>\n","<P>13    when the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.</P>\n","<P>14            I would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there</P>\n","<P>15    was a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the</P>\n","<P>16    headquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long</P>\n","<P>17    debate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the</P>\n","<P>18    demand of the military to declare a state of emergency.</P>\n","<P>19            The top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the</P>\n","<P>20    behaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a</P>\n","<P>21    vote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.  As far as I can</P>\n","<P>22    remember --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You have answered the question I asked, thanks.</P>\n","<P>24            Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43653 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   That is what is referred to here.  It says the representatives on</P>\n","<P> 2    the Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,</P>\n","<P> 3    the autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of</P>\n","<P> 4    Kosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what</P>\n","<P> 5    was so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the</P>\n","<P> 6    Presidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also</P>\n","<P> 8    start the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven't got the document here</P>\n","<P> 9    so I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were</P>\n","<P>10    actually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already</P>\n","<P>11    started putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the</P>\n","<P>12    Presidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the</P>\n","<P>13    Presidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not</P>\n","<P>14    very constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the</P>\n","<P>15    Presidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,</P>\n","<P>16    or Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.</P>\n","<P>17    I think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been</P>\n","<P>18    recalled in the meantime.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that</P>\n","<P>20    session or before that session or in relation to that session I never</P>\n","<P>21    declared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did</P>\n","<P>22    they declare that Yugoslavia was finished?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   I've already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian</P>\n","<P>24    politicians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was</P>\n","<P>25    one of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43654 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    hard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.</P>\n","<P> 2            As for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in</P>\n","<P> 3    Montenegro either.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to</P>\n","<P> 5    normal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic</P>\n","<P> 6    was elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented</P>\n","<P> 7    Vojvodina at the time.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the</P>\n","<P> 9    Presidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started</P>\n","<P>10    working again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its</P>\n","<P>11    work.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of</P>\n","<P>12    Bosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil</P>\n","<P>13    Tupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new</P>\n","<P>14    crisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be</P>\n","<P>15    elected president of the Presidency.</P>\n","<P>16            There was a principle involved that the president of the</P>\n","<P>17    Presidency was elected from a different republican province every year but</P>\n","<P>18    nobody's election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic</P>\n","<P>19    did not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European</P>\n","<P>20    envoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to</P>\n","<P>21    elect him nevertheless.</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting</P>\n","<P>24    the preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from</P>\n","<P>25    those positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43655 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says</P>\n","<P> 2    that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and</P>\n","<P> 3    discussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between</P>\n","<P> 4    Serbia and Croatia?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I</P>\n","<P> 6    remember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what</P>\n","<P> 7    was skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching</P>\n","<P> 8    agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the</P>\n","<P> 9    Bosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a</P>\n","<P>10    situation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it</P>\n","<P>11    increasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the</P>\n","<P>12    country at the time.</P>\n","<P>13            At that time, I -- as I've already said, the presidents of the</P>\n","<P>14    presidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys</P>\n","<P>15    had actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach</P>\n","<P>16    agreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia</P>\n","<P>17    increasingly so.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through</P>\n","<P>19    what medium?</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully</P>\n","<P>21    being bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media</P>\n","<P>22    this kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were</P>\n","<P>23    already at that time being financed from the West by different Western</P>\n","<P>24    intelligence agencies, so that's the kind of media I'm talking about.  In</P>\n","<P>25    Belgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43656 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    federal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic</P>\n","<P> 2    government, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government</P>\n","<P> 3    in Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the</P>\n","<P> 4    Western powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante</P>\n","<P> 5    Markovic's government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible</P>\n","<P> 6    agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 7    together under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been</P>\n","<P> 8    eliminated.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at</P>\n","<P>12    one stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence</P>\n","<P>13    counsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest</P>\n","<P>14    collaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This</P>\n","<P>15    denies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of</P>\n","<P>16    Bosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted</P>\n","<P>17    into evidence and if not we will find this transcript.</P>\n","<P>18            However, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with</P>\n","<P>19    you as you were an active participant in all political events.  This</P>\n","<P>20    meeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the</P>\n","<P>21    division of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any</P>\n","<P>22    member of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning</P>\n","<P>23    of which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way</P>\n","<P>24    even indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43657 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    if Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 2    as an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as</P>\n","<P> 3    a constituent nation as they had been before in the previous</P>\n","<P> 4    constitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the</P>\n","<P> 5    first president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it</P>\n","<P> 6    was not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint</P>\n","<P> 7    state.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans</P>\n","<P> 8    persuaded him to call off the agreement.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It</P>\n","<P>10    says:  \"On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY</P>\n","<P>11    Presidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,</P>\n","<P>12    Sejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY</P>\n","<P>13    Presidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the</P>\n","<P>14    Presidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and</P>\n","<P>15    Macedonia.\"</P>\n","<P>16            On the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.

There was absolutely no takeover.

In paragraph 65 it says:  \"On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,</P>\n","<P> 7    Slobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal</P>\n","<P> 8    enterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from</P>\n","<P> 9    Belgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the</P>\n","<P>10    mobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay</P>\n","<P>11    in Yugoslavia.\"</P>\n","<P>12            First of all, let's establish when I began advocating a unitary</P>\n","<P>13    Serb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And</P>\n","<P>14    secondly, was this anyone's idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,</P>\n","<P>15    and is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever</P>\n","<P>16    been a unitary state?</P>\n","<P>17       A.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as</P>\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally</P>\n","<P>19    and your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt</P>\n","<P>20    the new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the</P>\n","<P>21    autonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the</P>\n","<P>22    Serb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of</P>\n","<P>23    autonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an</P>\n","<P>24    option.</P>\n","<P>25            Furthermore, when the four former federal units had already been</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43660 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    recognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the</P>\n","<P> 2    Montenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be</P>\n","<P> 3    promulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump</P>\n","<P> 4    Yugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would</P>\n","<P> 5    have been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -</P>\n","<P> 6    because that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary</P>\n","<P> 7    Serbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this</P>\n","<P> 8    but didn't want to, and I am sorry that you didn't do that, because up to</P>\n","<P> 9    the point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --</P>\n","<P>10    in Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It</P>\n","<P>11    appeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any</P>\n","<P>13    of my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who</P>\n","<P>14    were allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had</P>\n","<P>15    any kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated</P>\n","<P>17    with you advocated such an idea.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it</P>\n","<P>19    says here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of</P>\n","<P>20    reservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the</P>\n","<P>21    reasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was</P>\n","<P>22    called for?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   I'm not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation</P>\n","<P>24    of reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to</P>\n","<P>25    mobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43661 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    to take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the</P>\n","<P> 2    territorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that</P>\n","<P> 3    this mobilisation didn't go well.  The response was very poor, because</P>\n","<P> 4    Veljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn't want to remove the</P>\n","<P> 5    communist insignia from the military uniforms.</P>\n","<P> 6            The Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the</P>\n","<P> 7    Presidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was</P>\n","<P> 8    Prime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in</P>\n","<P> 9    Slovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of</P>\n","<P>10    such an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops</P>\n","<P>11    into Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then</P>\n","<P>12    leadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as</P>\n","<P>13    I know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership</P>\n","<P>14    which had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your</P>\n","<P>16    name, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask</P>\n","<P>17    you now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of</P>\n","<P>18    April, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan's and</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you</P>\n","<P>20    know anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and</P>\n","<P>21    cart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of</P>\n","<P>22    cooperation with Arkan's volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>24    did not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert</P>\n","<P>25    that, I'm saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43662 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    organised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as</P>\n","<P> 2    much as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.</P>\n","<P> 3    That's a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P> 4    Radical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty</P>\n","<P> 5    to Serbia.  I guarantee that.</P>\n","<P> 6            The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict</P>\n","<P> 7    instructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb</P>\n","<P> 8    volunteer guard up to the --</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm asking why was that instruction given to the</P>\n","<P>10    volunteers of the Serb Radical Party?</P>\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.</P>\n","<P>12    We didn't want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn't</P>\n","<P>13    want people's awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.</P>\n","<P>14            As I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,</P>\n","<P>15    long before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had</P>\n","<P>16    quarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was</P>\n","<P>17    in danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this</P>\n","<P>18    in the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding</P>\n","<P>20    that instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with</P>\n","<P>21    Arkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You're</P>\n","<P>22    not there with them.</P>\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can't say that not a single</P>\n","<P>24    volunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There's one</P>\n","<P>25    instance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43663 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    teacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 2    Party.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of</P>\n","<P> 3    about 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back</P>\n","<P> 4    but, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of</P>\n","<P> 5    Arkan's men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.</P>\n","<P> 6            So, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint</P>\n","<P> 7    military activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with</P>\n","<P> 8    Arkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a</P>\n","<P> 9    distance from Arkan.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.</P>\n","<P>11            Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on</P>\n","<P>14    transcript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia</P>\n","<P>15    took place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj's</P>\n","<P>16    White Eagles.</P>\n","<P>17            First of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and</P>\n","<P>18    secondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj's White Eagles?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb</P>\n","<P>20    people organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have</P>\n","<P>21    already said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of</P>\n","<P>22    volunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After</P>\n","<P>23    that, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we</P>\n","<P>24    had volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never</P>\n","<P>25    had anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43664 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            There was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo</P>\n","<P> 2    Selo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he</P>\n","<P> 3    was killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not</P>\n","<P> 4    carrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no</P>\n","<P> 5    joint military activities.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Let's clarify this.  It doesn't say here that you cooperated.  It</P>\n","<P> 7    says here:  \"With infiltration of Seselj's White Eagles.\"  So the White</P>\n","<P> 8    Eagles are being ascribed to you.</P>\n","<P> 9       A.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the</P>\n","<P>10    Prosecutor bringing witnesses here who don't no anything about what</P>\n","<P>11    happened on the ground.  It's simply nonsense to talk of a group called</P>\n","<P>12    Seselj's White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and</P>\n","<P>13    the Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn't know</P>\n","<P>14    what he was talking about.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,</P>\n","<P>16    2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that \"Seselj collected men in</P>\n","<P>17    Erdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia.\"  Is that</P>\n","<P>18    true, Mr. Seselj?</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493</P>\n","<P>20    who testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake</P>\n","<P>22    in my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that</P>\n","<P>23    particular page, and the page is 19003.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43665 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    them to Bosnia?</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in</P>\n","<P> 3    Erdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,</P>\n","<P> 4    nicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only</P>\n","<P> 5    time.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --</P>\n","<P> 6    we never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there</P>\n","<P> 7    either, and I can state that quite categorically.</P>\n","<P> 8            The people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the</P>\n","<P> 9    war and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were</P>\n","<P>10    exclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I</P>\n","<P>11    absolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan's centre in Erdut</P>\n","<P>12    later on.  We never had anything to do with it.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is</P>\n","<P>14    20294, says that Arkan's and Seselj's men shot above the heads of the</P>\n","<P>15    civilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in</P>\n","<P>16    Bratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who</P>\n","<P>17    mistreated and abused the civilians?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian</P>\n","<P>19    Radical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my</P>\n","<P>20    knowledge Arkan didn't appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in</P>\n","<P>21    Zvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in</P>\n","<P>22    Bratunac either.  And I've already said that in Bratunac there was</P>\n","<P>23    Deronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there</P>\n","<P>24    I was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have</P>\n","<P>25    very certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43666 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj's men were</P>\n","<P> 2    in Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 3    mean there is no difference, says he.</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can't see any</P>\n","<P> 5    difference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the</P>\n","<P> 6    White Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at</P>\n","<P> 7    all.  And that's not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some</P>\n","<P> 8    judgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to</P>\n","<P> 9    see in some other places Seselj's White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the</P>\n","<P>10    problem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses</P>\n","<P>11    which it manipulates.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on</P>\n","<P>13    several occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --</P>\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven't been able to check this myself</P>\n","<P>15    because the accused hasn't been getting the references correct, and it's</P>\n","<P>16    quite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I'm grateful to</P>\n","<P>17    Ms. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came</P>\n","<P>18    (redacted).</P>\n","<P>19    But, really, I'm afraid we've got to have correct references for the</P>\n","<P>20    witnesses.  We can't simply just go to the page in the transcript.</P>\n","<P>21    Frequently our page numbers don't necessarily coincide here in court, and</P>\n","<P>22    without reference to the witnesses it's very difficult to pick it up</P>\n","<P>23    later.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in</P>\n","<P>25    pinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you're referring.

I'll check that out</P>\n","<P>14    during the break.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript</P>\n","<P>17    said that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of</P>\n","<P>18    March, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan's men took part as well as</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the</P>\n","<P>20    occupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on</P>\n","<P>21    the 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of</P>\n","<P>22    your volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What</P>\n","<P>24    happened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between</P>\n","<P>25    the JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43668 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Muslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.</P>\n","<P> 2    However, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went</P>\n","<P> 3    on for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting</P>\n","<P> 4    the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was</P>\n","<P> 5    there, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my</P>\n","<P> 6    knowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of</P>\n","<P> 7    the local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to</P>\n","<P> 8    establish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the</P>\n","<P> 9    ground there.</P>\n","<P>10            I know -- have reliable information that the commands and the</P>\n","<P>11    officers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan's and</P>\n","<P>12    the Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a</P>\n","<P>13    great deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very</P>\n","<P>14    rarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.</P>\n","<P>15            As far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,</P>\n","<P>16    over there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did</P>\n","<P>17    appear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the</P>\n","<P>18    call of Biljana Plavsic.  I can't prove that, but I do know that Biljana</P>\n","<P>19    Plavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly</P>\n","<P>20    meeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The</P>\n","<P>21    volunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina</P>\n","<P>22    were not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the</P>\n","<P>23    Serbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were</P>\n","<P>24    residents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the</P>\n","<P>25    conflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43669 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    and Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan's right-hand man.  And in</P>\n","<P> 2    Serbia we didn't send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something</P>\n","<P> 4    for me in relation to the Prosecution's case.  In the Bosnia indictment</P>\n","<P> 5    the allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other</P>\n","<P> 6    members of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the</P>\n","<P> 7    Prosecution case unfolded, you're not saying, are you, that he acted</P>\n","<P> 8    alone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with</P>\n","<P> 9    other members of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven't reviewed each and every allegation</P>\n","<P>11    to check that there isn't one there that may be susceptible to individual</P>\n","<P>12    perpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he's working with others.</P>\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually</P>\n","<P>16    your case.  It's not that he acted alone.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. NICE:  Subject to the point I've just made.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you've made, yes.</P>\n","<P>19            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Very well, Mr. Seselj.  You've just heard that explanation too.</P>\n","<P>23    Now, since you know the relationships very well between people at that</P>\n","<P>24    time, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and</P>\n","<P>25    Zvornik yourself.

NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and</P>\n","<P> 4    I think perhaps there's this qualification, although I don't think it is a</P>\n","<P> 5    qualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this</P>\n","<P> 6    accused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top</P>\n","<P> 7    political level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are</P>\n","<P> 8    criminal in nature.  It's the standard method of generation of</P>\n","<P> 9    genocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar</P>\n","<P>10    [phoen].</P>\n","<P>11            Now, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other</P>\n","<P>12    people.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may</P>\n","<P>13    be minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in</P>\n","<P>14    those circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting</P>\n","<P>15    alone in certain circumstances, but that's the only qualification I think</P>\n","<P>16    I should make.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it's a point that will warrant some</P>\n","<P>18    consideration later on, yes.</P>\n","<P>19            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>20            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   So Arkan is mentioned here as well as Mauzer.  Did I or anybody</P>\n","<P>22    else from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all</P>\n","<P>23    and with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   I'm quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.</P>\n","<P>25    On the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43672 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    contacts with Arkan.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many</P>\n","<P> 3    questions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the</P>\n","<P> 4    evidence he's giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,</P>\n","<P> 5    how is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan</P>\n","<P> 6    or Mauzer?</P>\n","<P> 7            He's giving evidence.  He's saying that you had nothing to do with</P>\n","<P> 8    him.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to</P>\n","<P> 9    establish how he's in a position to make that statement.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that</P>\n","<P>12    cannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from</P>\n","<P>13    the authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or</P>\n","<P>14    relationship with Arkan or Mauzer?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   In Belgrade you couldn't hide anything like that.  It would be</P>\n","<P>16    impossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is</P>\n","<P>17    that kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become</P>\n","<P>18    public.</P>\n","<P>19            Second, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts</P>\n","<P>20    only with Zoran Djindjic.  And I've already spoken about the relationship</P>\n","<P>21    between Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic's vice-president and the</P>\n","<P>22    president of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his</P>\n","<P>23    pre-electoral campaign.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   Let's clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did</P>\n","<P>25    you have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43673 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    able to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in</P>\n","<P> 2    Bijeljina?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina</P>\n","<P> 4    sufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,</P>\n","<P> 5    including Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this</P>\n","<P> 6    trial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events</P>\n","<P> 7    that went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in</P>\n","<P> 8    Bijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements</P>\n","<P> 9    and held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and</P>\n","<P>10    severely criticised Mauzer's conduct, especially Mauzer's conduct towards</P>\n","<P>11    the Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am</P>\n","<P>12    preparing them for my own trial, which doesn't seem to be starting.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack</P>\n","<P>14    on the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the</P>\n","<P>15    JNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by</P>\n","<P>16    the Red Berets or, rather, Arkan's and Seselj's men.  So that's the</P>\n","<P>17    quotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan's</P>\n","<P>18    and Seselj's men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red</P>\n","<P>19    Berets were they?  What Arkan's men were they, Seselj's men were they</P>\n","<P>20    around Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the</P>\n","<P>22    witness don't seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened</P>\n","<P>23    to see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red</P>\n","<P>24    cap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.</P>\n","<P>25    And then he -- the witness doesn't know whether they were Seselj's men or</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43674 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Arkan's men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it's</P>\n","<P> 2    highly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of</P>\n","<P> 3    his head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify</P>\n","<P> 4    so-called Seselj's men and Arkan's men and these alleged Red Berets.</P>\n","<P> 5            As for the Red Berets, I've already given you reliable facts about</P>\n","<P> 6    them and said that name appeared in different situations relating to</P>\n","<P> 7    different military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina</P>\n","<P> 8    area where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then</P>\n","<P> 9    the army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of</P>\n","<P>10    the intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until</P>\n","<P>11    the special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of</P>\n","<P>12    Serbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this</P>\n","<P>13    misunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed</P>\n","<P>14    to people with -- which they had nothing to do with.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the</P>\n","<P>16    following:  \"Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P>17    who were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done.\"</P>\n","<P>18    That's when this witness claims.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He's a colonel by</P>\n","<P>20    rank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff</P>\n","<P>21    of the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the</P>\n","<P>22    number two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that's the same</P>\n","<P>23    Osman Selak that you're referring to.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   Well, I can't tell you that.</P>\n","<P>25       A.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43675 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a</P>\n","<P> 2    statement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,</P>\n","<P> 3    what the circumstances were in which I said it.</P>\n","<P> 4            I did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the</P>\n","<P> 5    secession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia</P>\n","<P> 6    seceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,</P>\n","<P> 7    and for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he</P>\n","<P> 8    personally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.</P>\n","<P> 9            As far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from</P>\n","<P>10    Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of</P>\n","<P>11    Yugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and</P>\n","<P>12    Raska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of</P>\n","<P>13    examples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army</P>\n","<P>14    perform their duty very honourably.</P>\n","<P>15            So the citizens --</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are</P>\n","<P>18    saying that you did make such a statement or you didn't make such a</P>\n","<P>19    statement.</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if</P>\n","<P>21    you don't show me something like that here, where and when.

They</P>\n","<P>24    were published.  So let's see.</P>\n","<P>25            My objection is precisely in that.

You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live</P>\n","<P> 8    in Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in</P>\n","<P> 9    the army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as</P>\n","<P>10    officers?</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's simply confusing me further.  The quote was</P>\n","<P>12    that you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims</P>\n","<P>13    and Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that</P>\n","<P>14    you could possibly have made that statement in these terms?</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not saying that I made that kind</P>\n","<P>16    of statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak</P>\n","<P>17    testified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise</P>\n","<P>18    lines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman</P>\n","<P>19    Selak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be</P>\n","<P>20    established.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the</P>\n","<P>21    Prosecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly</P>\n","<P>22    what I said.</P>\n","<P>23            I am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,</P>\n","<P>24    but it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you're asking me to do is</P>\n","<P>25    to comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43677 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Selak's view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make</P>\n","<P> 2    my statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm</P>\n","<P> 4    trying to understand the answer you've given to the question asked by</P>\n","<P> 5    Mr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you've just said, the problem is</P>\n","<P> 6    that you've been studying this yourself, and you're trying to justify a</P>\n","<P> 7    position of your own without really dealing specifically with the question</P>\n","<P> 8    that's being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears</P>\n","<P> 9    now to be that you couldn't possibly have made a statement of that nature,</P>\n","<P>10    although you might have said something much more specific about different</P>\n","<P>11    people but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.</P>\n","<P>12            Now, is that a fair summary of your position?</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I'm not sure, by think you're</P>\n","<P>14    very close.  However, in order to help you, I'm going to give you an</P>\n","<P>15    example.</P>\n","<P>16            Throughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were</P>\n","<P>17    informed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,</P>\n","<P>18    escaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of</P>\n","<P>19    confidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998</P>\n","<P>20    we had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of</P>\n","<P>21    the military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his</P>\n","<P>22    family abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives</P>\n","<P>23    there.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn't remotely sound as if it's</P>\n","<P>25    going to be at all helpful to me, so we'll proceed with Mr. Milosevic's</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43678 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    questions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you</P>\n","<P> 2    was about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist</P>\n","<P> 3    statement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple</P>\n","<P> 4    issue I'm not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further</P>\n","<P> 5    if he wishes.</P>\n","<P> 6            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in</P>\n","<P>11    no uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that</P>\n","<P>12    any statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never</P>\n","<P>13    in my life have I made a racist statement.</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>\n","<P>19            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  There's nothing for you to respond to.</P>\n","<P>21            Mr. Milosevic, the next question.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I'm afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I</P>\n","<P>24    put a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific</P>\n","<P>25    terms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43679 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    here that \"Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 2    who were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed.\"  Did you ever state</P>\n","<P> 3    that?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I didn't say it that way.</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.

MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He</P>\n","<P>17    mentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether</P>\n","<P>18    those facts are correct.  And first of all, I'm interested in the</P>\n","<P>19    circumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  \"Just after</P>\n","<P>20    the bombing Seselj came to Pale.\"  And then on page 26762 he</P>\n","<P>21    says:  \"Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to</P>\n","<P>22    support the Bosnian Serbs.\"  These are a few facts that referred to.</P>\n","<P>23    Could you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this</P>\n","<P>24    actually all about?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43680 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the</P>\n","<P> 2    leadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly</P>\n","<P> 3    engaged in an anti-Serb policy.</P>\n","<P> 4            As for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market</P>\n","<P> 5    itself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the</P>\n","<P> 6    street of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these</P>\n","<P> 7    are explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of</P>\n","<P> 8    whether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar</P>\n","<P> 9    shells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.</P>\n","<P>10            This was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the</P>\n","<P>11    Serbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the</P>\n","<P>12    threats that were made, and so on and so forth.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there</P>\n","<P>14    you did so only to give political support to the leadership of</P>\n","<P>15    Republika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and</P>\n","<P>16    bombing.</P>\n","<P>17       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  \"In January or February</P>\n","<P>19    1992\" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, \"Arkan's</P>\n","<P>20    and Seselj's units arrived in Doboj.\"</P>\n","<P>21            Is this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?</P>\n","<P>22       A.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,</P>\n","<P>23    there were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.</P>\n","<P>24            Secondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to</P>\n","<P>25    Doboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan's Tigers never</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43681 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    operated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to</P>\n","<P> 3    this question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript page 27738, quite explicitly, \"Mirko Blagojevic,\" that is to</P>\n","<P> 5    say, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he</P>\n","<P> 6    says:  \"Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,</P>\n","<P> 7    and he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with</P>\n","<P> 8    Seselj.\"</P>\n","<P> 9            I am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>10    Party or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that</P>\n","<P>11    Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So</P>\n","<P>12    please deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the</P>\n","<P>13    transcript.  Is it correct or not?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is</P>\n","<P>15    organised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A</P>\n","<P>16    conflict occurs when two armed formations clash.</P>\n","<P>17            Mirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in</P>\n","<P>18    Bijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim</P>\n","<P>19    formations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any</P>\n","<P>20    conflicts.  And I guarantee with my own life that he took part in no</P>\n","<P>21    looting, no persecutions, no maltreatment of the civilian population and</P>\n","<P>22    so on and so forth.  I'm absolutely certain of that.</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Thank you.</P>\n","<P>24       A.   I can fully identify with everything that Mirko Blagojevic did.</P>\n","<P>25    It is to that degree that I'm certain that he never did anything against</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43682 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43683 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    the law.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  \"Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 3    men tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm.\"</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   My understanding is it's somewhere near Zvornik.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   That's quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 7    Party took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there</P>\n","<P> 8    in brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on</P>\n","<P> 9    for a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the</P>\n","<P>10    Muslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to</P>\n","<P>11    an end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>12    withdrew.</P>\n","<P>13            I preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on</P>\n","<P>14    guarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing</P>\n","<P>15    happened, I would have had to know about it.</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you</P>\n","<P>17    personally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following</P>\n","<P>18    circumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  \"Seselj,</P>\n","<P>19    on Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired</P>\n","<P>20    it at Muslims in Sarajevo.\"  This was shown on television, and he said</P>\n","<P>21    that you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at</P>\n","<P>23    Grbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called</P>\n","<P>24    international observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go</P>\n","<P>25    around the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43684 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Serb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was</P>\n","<P> 2    an apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I</P>\n","<P> 3    used a Browning machine-gun from there.  It's a heavy machine-gun.  I</P>\n","<P> 4    couldn't carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry</P>\n","<P> 5    it around.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   You cannot carry it.  It's too long.  It was installed in that</P>\n","<P> 8    building, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches</P>\n","<P> 9    below the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of</P>\n","<P>10    the volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was</P>\n","<P>11    firing from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and</P>\n","<P>12    the top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is</P>\n","<P>13    something I don't know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who</P>\n","<P>14    could have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this</P>\n","<P>15    small participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.</P>\n","<P>16            A Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that</P>\n","<P>17    case, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been</P>\n","<P>18    forced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of</P>\n","<P>19    those who in violation of international law of war brought him out there</P>\n","<P>20    to dig trenches, not those who --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,</P>\n","<P>24    that at the beginning of April Seselj's men arrived in the area of</P>\n","<P>25    Bratunac and Zvornik.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43685 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic's part.  He knows</P>\n","<P> 2    full well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing</P>\n","<P> 3    who he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and</P>\n","<P> 4    making this sweeping statement Seselj's men arrived in Bratunac and</P>\n","<P> 5    Zvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it's as if they were in Bratunac</P>\n","<P> 6    too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so</P>\n","<P> 7    Deronjic invented that.</P>\n","<P> 8            In Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the</P>\n","<P> 9    Bratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was</P>\n","<P>10    commander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he</P>\n","<P>11    was not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,</P>\n","<P>12    then a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.  I think the interpreter is having</P>\n","<P>14    some difficulty.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will.</P>\n","<P>16            You could have noticed, Mr. Robinson, that I have been trying as</P>\n","<P>17    of late to speak slowly, but sometimes, every now and then, I may forget</P>\n","<P>18    what you cautioned me about.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, I had noticed, and the -- we are</P>\n","<P>20    appreciative of the effort you are making.  You have answered the</P>\n","<P>21    question.</P>\n","<P>22            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the meantime --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think you have answered that question.</P>\n","<P>24            MR.

No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in</P>\n","<P> 2    Bratunac.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   All right.  So you are saying that he's not telling the truth.</P>\n","<P> 4            The same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not</P>\n","<P> 5    agree that Seselj was a true opposition.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.

This</P>\n","<P> 7    was Witness 1070.</P>\n","<P> 8            On page 20351 he says that Seselj's men were in Bratunac and that</P>\n","<P> 9    there was no difference between them and Seselj's men, the White Eagles,</P>\n","<P>10    that is.</P>\n","<P>11            And on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April</P>\n","<P>12    Seselj's and Arkan's men were in Bratunac together when some people were</P>\n","<P>13    deported.

Were you in the opposition or</P>\n","<P>24    not?</P>\n","<P>25            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43688 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it</P>\n","<P> 2    on.</P>\n","<P> 3            Both the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time</P>\n","<P> 4    were distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as</P>\n","<P> 5    it's possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by</P>\n","<P> 6    Deronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the</P>\n","<P> 7    opposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint</P>\n","<P> 8    often expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various</P>\n","<P> 9    government and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person</P>\n","<P>10    of the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or</P>\n","<P>11    Miles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery</P>\n","<P>12    and so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while</P>\n","<P>13    criticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition</P>\n","<P>14    politicians, and this logic is completely upside down.</P>\n","<P>15            MR.

Witness Ahmet Zulic says, and that's on page 30000 of the</P>\n","<P>17    transcript, he says that Seselj's men were stationed in the partisan</P>\n","<P>18    cemetery in Pobrezje, that doesn't matter so much but what matters is the</P>\n","<P>19    following, that they had come there to kill the Muslims.</P>\n","<P>20       A.

MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   The same witness, Ahmet Zulic, on page 30047, says in Sanski Most</P>\n","<P>15    there was no fighting, but the civilians fled because Seselj's men were</P>\n","<P>16    there.</P>\n","<P>17            Your men caused fear among civilians, although there was no</P>\n","<P>18    fighting there, as he says, in Sanski Most.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,</P>\n","<P>20    throughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did</P>\n","<P>21    not fight in any location.</P>\n","<P>22            This reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a</P>\n","<P>23    certain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying</P>\n","<P>24    that sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.</P>\n","<P>25    Somebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43690 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    arriving, and he spread panic.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that the Serbian word for</P>\n","<P> 3    sugar resembles Mr. Seselj's name.</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere</P>\n","<P> 5    in that area.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  \"From the</P>\n","<P> 8    1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan</P>\n","<P> 9    Milosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint</P>\n","<P>10    criminal,\" and so on,\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise</P>\n","<P>11    aided and abetted,\" and so on and so forth, all these phrases, \"the</P>\n","<P>12    planning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories</P>\n","<P>13    of Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>\n","<P>14    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.\"</P>\n","<P>15            Tell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in</P>\n","<P>16    this joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged</P>\n","<P>17    crimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made</P>\n","<P>18    here?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from</P>\n","<P>20    Serbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia</P>\n","<P>21    and Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted</P>\n","<P>22    to proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the</P>\n","<P>23    will of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the</P>\n","<P>24    West who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or</P>\n","<P>25    execution or extermination.  There was no plan.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43691 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            When the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in</P>\n","<P> 2    many places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only</P>\n","<P> 3    where the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats</P>\n","<P> 4    were in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,</P>\n","<P> 5    not a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the</P>\n","<P> 6    majority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They</P>\n","<P> 7    had already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we</P>\n","<P> 9    have already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the</P>\n","<P>10    other places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>\n","<P>11    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in</P>\n","<P>12    any kind of military activities?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in</P>\n","<P>14    January, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but</P>\n","<P>15    the UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,</P>\n","<P>16    although they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was</P>\n","<P>17    established, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be</P>\n","\n","<P>18    disarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.</P>\n","<P>19            The Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian</P>\n","<P>20    villages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there</P>\n","<P>21    were two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active</P>\n","<P>22    in the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces</P>\n","<P>23    in the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the</P>\n","<P>24    only activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica</P>\n","<P>25    area.  It was in the beginning of 1993.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43692 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            As for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,</P>\n","<P> 2    I don't know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up</P>\n","<P> 3    only in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all</P>\n","<P> 4    over Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army</P>\n","<P> 5    of the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska</P>\n","<P> 6    Krajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his</P>\n","<P> 7    volunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars</P>\n","<P> 8    there, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed</P>\n","<P>10    and what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy</P>\n","<P>11    that we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in</P>\n","<P>12    whole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and</P>\n","<P>13    Herzegovina?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and</P>\n","<P>15    there was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen</P>\n","<P>16    happened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on</P>\n","<P>17    their own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit</P>\n","<P>18    murders or anything of the kind.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war</P>\n","<P>20    in Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the</P>\n","<P>21    other participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by</P>\n","<P>22    Mr. Nice.</P>\n","<P>23            Look at paragraph 33.  We've just been discussing paragraph 32.  I</P>\n","<P>24    won't read the beginning of paragraph 33 because it's the same:  \"From on</P>\n","<P>25    or about the 1st of March, 1992,\" and so on and so forth, and then it</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43693 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    says:  \"On the territory of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa,</P>\n","<P> 2    Bosanski Novi, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Sarajevo (Ilijas), Kljuc,</P>\n","<P> 3    Kalinovik, Kotor Varos, Nevesinje, Sarajevo, Novi Grad, Sarajevo, Novo</P>\n","<P> 4    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Rudo, Sanski Most, Srebrenica</P>\n","<P> 5    again, Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\"  Please --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You are finished reading that list.

You</P>\n","<P> 2    know the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that</P>\n","<P> 3    referred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded</P>\n","<P> 4    in any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted</P>\n","<P> 6    to, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A</P>\n","<P> 7    civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally</P>\n","<P> 8    wanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a</P>\n","<P> 9    constituent people.</P>\n","<P>10            And the question arises from there where are the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>11    Mostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>12    Travnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>13    many other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats</P>\n","<P>14    during that civil war?</P>\n","<P>15            After the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the</P>\n","<P>16    population, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did</P>\n","<P>17    take place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,</P>\n","<P>18    in figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I</P>\n","<P>19    can put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes</P>\n","<P>20    crimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,</P>\n","<P>21    sometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,</P>\n","<P>22    criminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and</P>\n","<P>23    revenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes</P>\n","<P>24    did not exist.  That did not happen.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43696 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    joint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I'd like</P>\n","<P> 2    to draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of</P>\n","<P> 3    December, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33</P>\n","<P> 4    and indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns</P>\n","<P> 5    are repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns</P>\n","<P> 6    too.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.</P>\n","<P> 7            So what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during</P>\n","<P> 8    that period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of</P>\n","<P> 9    December 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring</P>\n","<P>10    Bosnia and Herzegovina?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia</P>\n","<P>12    or, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of</P>\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It</P>\n","<P>14    did not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help</P>\n","<P>15    materially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs</P>\n","<P>16    living over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different</P>\n","<P>17    political relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership</P>\n","<P>18    of Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in</P>\n","<P>19    which those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep</P>\n","<P>20    conflicts, and they didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues.</P>\n","<P>21            So throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the</P>\n","<P>22    indictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,</P>\n","<P>23    the leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered</P>\n","<P>24    in looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far</P>\n","<P>25    accepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43697 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    attacked ourselves for our part.</P>\n","<P> 2            So I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy</P>\n","<P> 3    dating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact</P>\n","<P> 4    that that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all</P>\n","<P> 5    costs.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no</P>\n","<P> 6    alternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at</P>\n","<P> 7    the price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept</P>\n","<P> 8    because they were not able to take such great concessions.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities</P>\n","<P>10    of that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these</P>\n","<P>11    towns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I</P>\n","<P>12    personally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,</P>\n","<P>13    et cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason</P>\n","<P>14    explanation?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Yes, I do, and that's explanation is the following and the fact</P>\n","<P>16    that through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,</P>\n","<P>17    and --</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not</P>\n","<P>19    an explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.</P>\n","<P>20            So please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,</P>\n","<P>23    Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac</P>\n","<P>24    again, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in</P>\n","<P>25    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43698 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with</P>\n","<P> 2    regard to that point of the indictment?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised</P>\n","<P> 4    crime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don't know whether in all the</P>\n","<P> 5    places enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took</P>\n","<P> 6    place in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each</P>\n","<P> 7    individual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the</P>\n","<P> 8    motives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are</P>\n","<P> 9    still living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can</P>\n","<P>10    be established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side</P>\n","<P>11    and the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to</P>\n","<P>12    investigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to</P>\n","<P>13    strike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the</P>\n","<P>14    number of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you've said when you said</P>\n","<P>16    that some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let's look at</P>\n","<P>17    that for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of</P>\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or</P>\n","<P>19    formations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes</P>\n","<P>20    that you know of?  Are there any links?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of</P>\n","<P>22    power and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as</P>\n","<P>23    well, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,</P>\n","<P>24    the Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the</P>\n","<P>25    Academy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43699 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    everybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out</P>\n","<P> 2    against them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for</P>\n","<P> 3    freedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were</P>\n","<P> 4    being perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes</P>\n","<P> 5    should be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind</P>\n","<P> 6    via the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political</P>\n","<P> 7    parties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which</P>\n","<P> 8    strove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors</P>\n","<P> 9    spoke out against crimes.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>11            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Now, we -- let's look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful</P>\n","<P>13    confinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,</P>\n","<P>14    Bosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the</P>\n","<P>15    territories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,</P>\n","<P>16    Samac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,</P>\n","<P>17    Kotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,</P>\n","<P>18    Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>19            Tell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these</P>\n","<P>20    people in these towns did we take part in?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have</P>\n","<P>22    had anything to do with any such thing.</P>\n","<P>23            First of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What</P>\n","<P>24    the confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of</P>\n","<P>25    civilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43700 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    unlawful, and there were such cases.</P>\n","<P> 2            Now, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of</P>\n","<P> 3    all, there were individual instances in some of these places through the</P>\n","<P> 4    self-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance</P>\n","<P> 5    of Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.</P>\n","<P> 6    And then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of</P>\n","<P> 7    their own because they couldn't influence him.  He appeared as a factor,</P>\n","<P> 8    and there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his</P>\n","<P> 9    motives were of a criminal nature.</P>\n","<P>10            There were other such cases in some of these places whereby</P>\n","<P>11    somebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in</P>\n","<P>12    order to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive</P>\n","<P>13    money and then release them once they received money for that.  There were</P>\n","<P>14    also instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,</P>\n","<P>15    somebody's family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or</P>\n","<P>16    Croats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often</P>\n","<P>17    were not able to prevent revenge of that kind.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Which authorities?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian</P>\n","<P>21    authorities intervene?</P>\n","<P>22       A.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn't influence or involve</P>\n","<P>23    themselves in any such matters.</P>\n","<P>24            So as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one</P>\n","<P>25    should take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43701 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    those cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and</P>\n","<P> 2    what the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.</P>\n","<P> 3            Now, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places</P>\n","<P> 4    where possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of</P>\n","<P> 5    context and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse</P>\n","<P> 6    top-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian</P>\n","<P> 7    Yugoslavia as well.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has</P>\n","<P> 9    become a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you</P>\n","<P>10    say that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing</P>\n","<P>11    like the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged</P>\n","<P>12    by the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn't understand me correctly,</P>\n","<P>14    Mr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,</P>\n","<P>15    but there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top</P>\n","<P>16    echelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely</P>\n","<P>17    impossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like</P>\n","<P>18    that, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is</P>\n","<P>19    impossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such</P>\n","<P>20    thing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did</P>\n","<P>21    commit crimes.  And it wasn't only individuals who committed crimes.</P>\n","<P>22    There was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.</P>\n","<P>23    And I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my</P>\n","<P>24    information, but I can't be well-versed in everything, but I can in</P>\n","<P>25    basics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43702 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    wasn't the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit</P>\n","<P> 2    crimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn't the policy of the</P>\n","<P> 3    leadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.</P>\n","<P> 4            Now, --</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn't the policy of this accused in</P>\n","<P> 6    concert with other --</P>\n","<P> 7            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of</P>\n","<P> 8    Mr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,</P>\n","<P> 9    continuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such</P>\n","<P>10    crimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the</P>\n","<P>11    most serious form of war crimes.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There's an enormous</P>\n","<P>15    list of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,</P>\n","<P>16    and the subject here is deportation.</P>\n","<P>17            Now, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let's clarify that.  Albeit in</P>\n","<P>18    Serbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,</P>\n","<P>19    Muslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,</P>\n","<P>20    70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle</P>\n","<P>21    of non-discrimination like anybody else.</P>\n","<P>22            Now, I can't clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is</P>\n","<P>23    being accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it</P>\n","<P>24    stated here -- it says:  \"Milosevic, acting alone or together with other</P>\n","<P>25    members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43703 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or</P>\n","<P> 2    execution of the unlawful forcible transfer...\"</P>\n","<P> 3            Now, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic</P>\n","<P> 4    of Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or</P>\n","<P> 5    unlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful</P>\n","<P> 6    movement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one</P>\n","<P> 7    individual?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with</P>\n","<P> 9    anything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these</P>\n","<P>10    phenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what</P>\n","<P>11    did happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group</P>\n","<P>12    to leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that</P>\n","<P>13    desire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were</P>\n","<P>14    instances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,</P>\n","<P>15    that people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,</P>\n","<P>16    something afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind</P>\n","<P>17    what had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to</P>\n","<P>18    move out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or</P>\n","<P>19    perhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they</P>\n","<P>20    were the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and</P>\n","<P>21    in some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established</P>\n","<P>22    in some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete</P>\n","<P>23    example, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from</P>\n","<P>24    Prijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a</P>\n","<P>25    convoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43704 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I'm stopping you because you have</P>\n","<P> 2    answered the question.  You are becoming a little too expansive.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think that this would be very</P>\n","<P> 4    important.</P>\n","<P> 5            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what example do you know of personally?</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   I'm talking about one example when Muslims were transported</P>\n","<P> 8    because they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And</P>\n","<P> 9    then the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose</P>\n","<P>10    name is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is</P>\n","<P>11    called Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large</P>\n","<P>12    group of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the</P>\n","<P>13    authorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part</P>\n","<P>14    of Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army</P>\n","<P>15    of Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.</P>\n","<P>16            Then he tried to explain this in a completely different way:</P>\n","<P>17    Somebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he's</P>\n","<P>18    trying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.</P>\n","<P>19            Such people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,</P>\n","<P>20    entered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and</P>\n","<P>21    then they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed</P>\n","<P>22    although they are invariably false because --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm stopping you.  Mr. Seselj, no doubt you're a</P>\n","<P>24    man of many virtues.  Is omniscience one of them?  How do you happen to</P>\n","<P>25    know all these things?

Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of</P>\n","<P>15    Serbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and</P>\n","<P>16    that as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon</P>\n","<P>17    what do you base this statement?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I</P>\n","<P>19    base my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent</P>\n","<P>20    statements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.</P>\n","<P>21            Secondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.</P>\n","<P>22    They never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never</P>\n","<P>23    discriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the</P>\n","<P>24    authorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in</P>\n","<P>25    Bosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43706 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43707 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    and treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.</P>\n","<P> 2            So there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic</P>\n","<P> 3    whatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution</P>\n","<P> 4    of Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in</P>\n","<P> 5    Serbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal</P>\n","<P> 6    of money.

Too fast.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   So I, Mr. Seselj, according to this paragraph 42, aided and</P>\n","<P>24    abetted the planning, preparation or execution, I executed this.  It</P>\n","<P>25    wasn't that I only aided and abetted others, but I committed wanton</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43708 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the Bosnian</P>\n","<P> 2    Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations, and again all these</P>\n","<P> 3    municipalities are listed here where I committed wanton looting of</P>\n","<P> 4    property belonging to Muslims and Croats.</P>\n","<P> 5            Please tell us not only what you know about this but also on the</P>\n","<P> 6    basis of what you know what you know.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in</P>\n","<P> 8    any way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of</P>\n","<P> 9    private and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three</P>\n","<P>10    sides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything</P>\n","<P>11    under control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.</P>\n","<P>12            What happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims</P>\n","<P>13    would loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have</P>\n","<P>14    their own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar</P>\n","<P>15    way in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no</P>\n","<P>16    official authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No</P>\n","<P>17    one personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,</P>\n","<P>18    et cetera.</P>\n","<P>19            There were paramilitary formations that had looting as their</P>\n","<P>20    primary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also</P>\n","<P>21    from Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People</P>\n","<P>22    travelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize</P>\n","<P>23    their car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were</P>\n","<P>24    such cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial</P>\n","<P>25    Chamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43709 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    looting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions</P>\n","<P> 2    that were rather chaotic.</P>\n","<P> 3            There was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.</P>\n","<P> 4    Not only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika</P>\n","<P> 5    Srpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in</P>\n","<P> 7    a military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto</P>\n","<P> 8    civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and</P>\n","<P> 9    wounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.</P>\n","<P>10            You were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please</P>\n","<P>11    explain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,</P>\n","<P>12    tell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of</P>\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.</P>\n","<P>14       A.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a</P>\n","<P>15    dissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict</P>\n","<P>16    in Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of</P>\n","<P>17    the duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case</P>\n","<P>18    elsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on</P>\n","<P>19    both sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less</P>\n","<P>20    casualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what</P>\n","<P>21    Judge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I</P>\n","<P>22    read.</P>\n","<P>23            I was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the</P>\n","<P>24    killing of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted</P>\n","<P>25    intentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43710 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Muslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present</P>\n","<P> 2    this in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,</P>\n","<P> 3    Vasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not</P>\n","<P> 4    take part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official</P>\n","<P> 5    factors from Serbia, that is.</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.  On the transcript it's a double</P>\n","<P> 7    negative.</P>\n","<P> 8            Yes, Mr. --</P>\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] There is a double negative in the</P>\n","<P>10    Serbian language and it does not change the meaning of the statement.  In</P>\n","<P>11    English it might mean something different.  I'm sorry I don't know English</P>\n","<P>12    and I cannot really adjust to this.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or</P>\n","<P>15    deny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took</P>\n","<P>16    part in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you</P>\n","<P>17    confirm that?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   All right.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The</P>\n","<P>21    Muslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the</P>\n","<P>22    liberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his</P>\n","<P>24    witness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,</P>\n","<P>25    including women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43711 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only</P>\n","<P> 2    logical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee</P>\n","<P> 3    from war.  They're fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.</P>\n","<P> 4            Very often in this war and in any other war civilians would get</P>\n","<P> 5    killed by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from</P>\n","<P> 6    the conflict.</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the</P>\n","<P> 8    Serbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it's supposed</P>\n","<P> 9    to seem?</P>\n","<P>10       A.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray</P>\n","<P>11    this, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their</P>\n","<P>12    victims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We</P>\n","<P>13    are faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is</P>\n","<P>14    based and anti-Serb grounds.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings</P>\n","<P>16    happened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all</P>\n","<P>17    of that can be found here in this indictment that I've been quoting to</P>\n","<P>18    you, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to</P>\n","<P>20    give.  Ask another question.</P>\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a</P>\n","<P>22    question to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that</P>\n","<P>23    he can give an answer.  He's a politician, an intellectual, a university</P>\n","<P>24    professor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,</P>\n","<P>25    and he is in a position to give an answer to this question.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43712 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And I've already ruled that he is not to answer</P>\n","<P> 2    it.  So proceed.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the</P>\n","<P> 6    JNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know</P>\n","<P> 7    about that?  This is on transcript page 20408.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The</P>\n","<P> 9    two sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the</P>\n","<P>10    bridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric</P>\n","<P>11    power plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to</P>\n","<P>12    destroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old</P>\n","<P>13    hydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the</P>\n","<P>14    paramilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The</P>\n","<P>15    conflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can't say exactly, I</P>\n","<P>16    wasn't there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And</P>\n","<P>17    then also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units</P>\n","<P>19    committed crimes in Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there</P>\n","<P>21    that can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but</P>\n","<P>22    who it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are</P>\n","<P>23    ascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to</P>\n","<P>24    Karadzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.</P>\n","<P>25            In Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43713 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    people for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing</P>\n","<P> 5    them, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They</P>\n","<P> 6    are mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided</P>\n","<P> 7    by Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,</P>\n","<P> 8    Drinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you</P>\n","<P> 9    heard anything about this and what do you know about it?</P>\n","<P>10       A.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my</P>\n","<P>11    knowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but</P>\n","<P>12    once the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very</P>\n","<P>13    simply, who the victims were and who the executors were.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the</P>\n","<P>15    cultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many</P>\n","<P>16    persons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force</P>\n","<P>17    there is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I'll just go</P>\n","<P>18    on.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were</P>\n","<P>20    committed.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn't the JNA that</P>\n","<P>21    took part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take</P>\n","<P>22    part in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully</P>\n","<P>23    investigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims</P>\n","<P>24    are still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether</P>\n","<P>25    there was enough will to investigate this matter, and I've already</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43714 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    referred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect</P>\n","<P> 2    a great deal from that.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I don't know anything about it.  I wasn't there.</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj and Mr. Milosevic, you are not</P>\n","<P> 6    observing the pause between question and answer, and you are thereby</P>\n","<P> 7    creating difficulties for the interpreter.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, this is the first time</P>\n","<P> 9    you have warned us about this today.  As you see, Mr. Seselj and I are</P>\n","<P>10    bearing this in mind.</P>\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We're practising.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment</P>\n","<P>14    in this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your</P>\n","<P>15    units.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan's men.  Do</P>\n","<P>16    you have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your</P>\n","<P>17    units were there?  You've already explained you didn't have any units of</P>\n","<P>18    yours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers</P>\n","<P>19    were there?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I'm not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik</P>\n","<P>21    area.  I know that Arkan's Tigers were active there but to what extent and</P>\n","<P>22    in what locations I couldn't say because I wasn't there.</P>\n","<P>23            All the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I</P>\n","<P>24    do not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and</P>\n","<P>25    misfortunes he talked about, but evidently he's very confused when</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43715 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    identifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He's mixing up Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 2    men, the White Eagles, Arkan's men, and this shows that he's very confused</P>\n","<P> 3    and unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers</P>\n","<P> 4    of the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to</P>\n","<P> 5    everything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very</P>\n","<P> 6    often it's beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn't be easy to</P>\n","<P> 7    establish who actually perpetrated this.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a</P>\n","<P> 9    certain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the</P>\n","<P>10    transcript.  Do you know anything about this?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>12    committed any crimes in that place.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>14    Radical Party?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>16    sent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,</P>\n","<P>17    and as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me</P>\n","<P>18    had any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I'm sure of it.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Would other volunteers have reported this?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and</P>\n","<P>21    they would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,</P>\n","<P>22    because this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about</P>\n","<P>24    the conducts of the volunteers?</P>\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn't say the reports were</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43716 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    regular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out</P>\n","<P> 2    how the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All</P>\n","<P> 3    the problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of</P>\n","<P> 4    indiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers</P>\n","<P> 5    to be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline</P>\n","<P> 6    of the other men.</P>\n","<P> 7            I was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the</P>\n","<P> 8    conclusion that none occurred.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral</P>\n","<P>11    conversations.</P>\n","<P>12            I'm convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written</P>\n","<P>13    reports would have been sent to me.  I'm sure that the competent command</P>\n","<P>14    would have told me had something like this happened.</P>\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>16            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Mr. Seselj, if you can't recall it doesn't matter, but is it true</P>\n","<P>18    that in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,</P>\n","<P>19    1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of</P>\n","<P>20    Seselj's men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj's men, then</P>\n","<P>22    should be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell</P>\n","<P>23    you whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group</P>\n","<P>24    of Seselj's men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he's</P>\n","<P>25    the leader if they don't know his name?  What does the term \"leader\" mean?</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43717 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Was he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times</P>\n","<P> 2    that volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in</P>\n","<P> 3    units larger than a company.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I</P>\n","<P> 6    have a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I</P>\n","<P> 7    wanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the</P>\n","<P> 8    indictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no</P>\n","<P> 9    such instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>10    Party.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such</P>\n","<P>14    instances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various</P>\n","<P>15    allegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of</P>\n","<P>16    time.</P>\n","<P>17            Please tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about</P>\n","<P>18    the events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men</P>\n","<P>19    participated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.</P>\n","<P>20       A.

Don't assume</P>\n","<P>11    that because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he's the</P>\n","<P>12    best person to contradict it.</P>\n","<P>13            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.</P>\n","<P>14            MR.

I'll skip over the witness's</P>\n","<P>16    name because I can't recall at present whether or not he was protected,</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Robinson.  I don't think he was, because I don't have any note to that</P>\n","<P>18    effect, but he says:  \"In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the</P>\n","<P>19    White Wolves, and the JNA participated.\"</P>\n","<P>20            Do you know anything about this?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,</P>\n","<P>22    there was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from</P>\n","<P>23    Eastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the</P>\n","<P>24    indictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.</P>\n","<P>25    His name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43721 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    helicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was</P>\n","<P> 2    accompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 3    Party, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for</P>\n","<P> 4    sure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also</P>\n","<P> 5    Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as</P>\n","<P> 6    the Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was</P>\n","<P> 7    charged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in</P>\n","<P> 8    Banja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 9    Party.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and</P>\n","<P>10    the party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don't know that Kragujevac</P>\n","<P>12    is not in Bosnia.</P>\n","<P>13       A.   That's correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I'm getting ready</P>\n","<P>14    to obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was</P>\n","<P>15    expelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan</P>\n","<P>16    Savic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the</P>\n","<P>17    Serb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave</P>\n","<P>18    my legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial</P>\n","<P>19    and all the accompanying materials.</P>\n","<P>20            As for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to</P>\n","<P>21    me certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man</P>\n","<P>22    Radovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his</P>\n","<P>23    participation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.</P>\n","<P>24            Those are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members</P>\n","<P>25    of the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43722 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    had previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even</P>\n","<P> 2    called him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was</P>\n","<P> 3    Srecko Radovanovic.</P>\n","<P> 4            There was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was</P>\n","<P> 5    certainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was</P>\n","<P> 6    certainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been</P>\n","<P> 7    he would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that</P>\n","<P> 8    unit was called the Grey Wolves.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I've understood</P>\n","<P>10    from that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions</P>\n","<P>11    in Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you've said?</P>\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,</P>\n","<P>13    yes.</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called</P>\n","<P>15    the Grey Wolves active there?</P>\n","<P>16            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it's very problematic to say</P>\n","<P>17    paramilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means</P>\n","<P>18    outside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial</P>\n","<P>19    Defence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I'm not</P>\n","<P>20    sure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,</P>\n","<P>21    I think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good</P>\n","<P>22    fighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what</P>\n","<P>23    happened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called</P>\n","<P>24    Crkvina or something like that.  I can't recall it all off the top of my</P>\n","<P>25    head, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43723 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Banja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven't dealt with.  Did</P>\n","<P> 3    they participate?</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What</P>\n","<P> 5    Red Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's a perfectly legitimate answer for you to</P>\n","<P> 7    give, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the</P>\n","<P> 8    Red Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the</P>\n","<P> 9    quotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,</P>\n","<P>10    which on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they've got</P>\n","<P>11    nothing to do with the question.  So all I'm doing now is trying to find</P>\n","<P>12    out what the real answer to that question is.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.</P>\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the</P>\n","<P>15    Red Berets.</P>\n","<P>16                          --- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.</P>\n","<P>17                          --- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the</P>\n","<P>19    technical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary</P>\n","<P>20    resulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected</P>\n","<P>21    witness.</P>\n","<P>22            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>23            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43724 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Wolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also</P>\n","<P> 2    mentioned.  Now, the witness, I don't know whether he was protected or</P>\n","<P> 3    not, I don't want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript says that he saw 20 locals, and it's about Samac, wearing</P>\n","<P> 5    uniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed</P>\n","<P> 6    they were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned</P>\n","<P> 7    to Samac.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, I don't have any information to that effect, and that is</P>\n","<P> 9    quite impossible.  I'd like to point out once again that in different</P>\n","<P>10    places they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had</P>\n","<P>11    found some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have</P>\n","<P>12    been various units, especially as we're talking about locals in this</P>\n","<P>13    particular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What</P>\n","<P>14    does it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some</P>\n","<P>15    warehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they</P>\n","<P>16    were some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the</P>\n","<P>17    Red Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of</P>\n","<P>18    the State Security in 1996.</P>\n","<P>19            So quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term</P>\n","<P>20    applies to different concepts.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I</P>\n","<P>22    think that is in the indictment against you but you'll put me right if I'm</P>\n","<P>23    wrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,</P>\n","<P>24    that is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,</P>\n","<P>25    wherein amongst others you said:  \"Dear brother Chetniks, especially you</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43725 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    across the Drina, you're the bravest, and we're going to clear up Bosnia</P>\n","<P> 2    from the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong.\"  Is</P>\n","<P> 3    it true that you said that?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and</P>\n","<P> 5    partially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,</P>\n","<P> 6    because -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don't always know</P>\n","<P> 7    the Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an</P>\n","<P> 8    artificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the</P>\n","<P> 9    Croats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian</P>\n","<P>10    variation \"pogan\" means \"pagan,\" where as in the Serb language \"pogan\"</P>\n","<P>11    means \"waste\" or \"faeces.\"  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and</P>\n","<P>12    pan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called</P>\n","<P>13    them \"pogani,\" which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the</P>\n","<P>14    Muslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I'm not a stupid</P>\n","<P>15    man.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have</P>\n","<P>16    nothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more</P>\n","<P>17    than I do to all the Christians afterwards, let's make that point clear,</P>\n","<P>18    but I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --</P>\n","<P>19    greatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims</P>\n","<P>20    to be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.</P>\n","<P>21            So here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion</P>\n","<P>22    is being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,</P>\n","<P>23    and I've been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,</P>\n","<P>24    Islamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they</P>\n","<P>25    first appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43726 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.

I said that the</P>\n","<P> 2    Crkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey</P>\n","<P> 3    Wolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was</P>\n","<P> 4    arrested, but I don't have any details about how the trial proceeded and</P>\n","<P> 5    the upshot.

Is that the event you are referring to?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn't there</P>\n","<P>13    nor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical</P>\n","<P>14    Party.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   That's all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your</P>\n","<P>16    answer suffices.</P>\n","<P>17            You are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when</P>\n","<P>18    allegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated</P>\n","<P>19    killed 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating</P>\n","<P>21    on the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?</P>\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was</P>\n","<P>23    quoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>\n","<P>24    So it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this</P>\n","<P>25    question of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43729 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    concept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he</P>\n","<P> 2    stands accused, because he's testifying here.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily</P>\n","<P> 4    relevant for that purpose.</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I'm not going to</P>\n","<P> 6    insist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.</P>\n","<P> 7            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993</P>\n","<P> 9    some members of your alleged --</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have</P>\n","<P>11    continued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not</P>\n","<P>12    see at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial</P>\n","<P>13    here.  I know that he's alleged to be a member of the joint criminal</P>\n","<P>14    enterprise.  I'm well aware of that.  But that doesn't let in any and all</P>\n","<P>15    kind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.</P>\n","<P>16            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see</P>\n","<P>17    here that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,</P>\n","<P>18    then that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren't true</P>\n","<P>19    either, and he has refuted a number of witnesses' statements here that I</P>\n","<P>20    quoted.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know</P>\n","<P>22    you know that.</P>\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.</P>\n","<P>24            MR.

Do you</P>\n","<P> 3    know anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked</P>\n","<P> 4    to killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire</P>\n","<P> 6    in Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front</P>\n","<P> 7    line stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part</P>\n","<P> 8    under Muslim control and another part under Serb control.</P>\n","<P> 9            Now, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind</P>\n","<P>10    the following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from</P>\n","<P>11    rifles which wasn't a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because</P>\n","<P>12    sniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with</P>\n","<P>13    optic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the</P>\n","<P>14    Serb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to</P>\n","<P>15    come by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black</P>\n","<P>16    market.  I don't exclude the possibility of individual cases there being</P>\n","<P>17    the need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was</P>\n","<P>18    opened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain</P>\n","<P>19    control of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two</P>\n","<P>20    sides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn't</P>\n","<P>21    change for many years, and one or the other side would take control of</P>\n","<P>22    certain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.</P>\n","<P>23            On the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional</P>\n","<P>24    killing of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims</P>\n","<P>25    killed about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43732 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    in Kazani and so on.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the</P>\n","<P> 3    Sarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present</P>\n","<P> 4    on both sides.  Is that true?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in</P>\n","<P> 6    Sarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The</P>\n","<P> 7    real snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far</P>\n","<P> 8    more than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more</P>\n","<P> 9    sophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more</P>\n","<P>10    favourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I've forgotten the evidence which I</P>\n","<P>12    think there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How</P>\n","<P>13    much personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the</P>\n","<P>14    conflict there.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to</P>\n","<P>16    the Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that</P>\n","<P>17    is.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.</P>\n","<P>18    At Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and</P>\n","<P>19    I met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh</P>\n","<P>20    shipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my</P>\n","<P>21    colleagues from university and also people whom I'd been to school with,</P>\n","<P>22    Muslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire</P>\n","<P>24    going on?</P>\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43733 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    stay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some</P>\n","<P> 2    dangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you</P>\n","<P> 3    had to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but</P>\n","<P> 4    there were no more serious conflicts at that time.</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,</P>\n","<P> 8    referred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on</P>\n","<P> 9    page 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs</P>\n","<P>10    fired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in</P>\n","<P>11    Sarajevo?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open</P>\n","<P>13    fire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be</P>\n","<P>14    ascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused</P>\n","<P>15    protected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction</P>\n","<P>16    from the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo</P>\n","<P>17    they would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at</P>\n","<P>18    Serb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off</P>\n","<P>19    in the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,</P>\n","<P>20    then they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at</P>\n","<P>21    hospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,</P>\n","<P>22    who were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the</P>\n","<P>23    hospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw</P>\n","<P>24    quickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived</P>\n","<P>25    they didn't come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43734 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    fire in retaliation.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited</P>\n","<P> 3    Bijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --</P>\n","<P> 4    page 8258 of Alija Gusalic's -- 18258, and I link this up with your</P>\n","<P> 5    indictment and Alija Gusalic's testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina</P>\n","<P> 6    and members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to</P>\n","<P> 7    takeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite</P>\n","<P> 9    correct.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just</P>\n","<P>10    nonsense.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there</P>\n","<P>12    were Arkan's men and Seselj's men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything</P>\n","<P>13    about that?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb</P>\n","<P>15    Radical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I'm absolutely certain</P>\n","<P>16    of that.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   The same witness says on page 18260, \"Seselj's men had beards and</P>\n","<P>18    cockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to</P>\n","<P>19    distribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party.\"</P>\n","<P>20       A.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>21    Radical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly</P>\n","<P>22    clean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not</P>\n","<P>23    bring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot</P>\n","<P>24    be synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for</P>\n","<P>25    ideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43735 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    not a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier</P>\n","<P> 2    having a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not</P>\n","<P> 3    distribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role</P>\n","<P> 4    in these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.</P>\n","<P> 5            Members of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but</P>\n","<P> 6    exclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now</P>\n","<P> 8    I'm asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were</P>\n","<P> 9    not Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were</P>\n","<P>10    held at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you</P>\n","<P>11    know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   I don't know about those particular localities, but I've already</P>\n","<P>13    talked about Mauzer's and Arkan's conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for</P>\n","<P>14    that reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often</P>\n","<P>15    attacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   I'm sorry that I didn't draw your attention to this on time,</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you</P>\n","<P>18    are being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in</P>\n","<P>19    Batkovic.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I've already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>21    Radical Party there.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.</P>\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic</P>\n","<P>24    testified here, and he made those assertions here, and I'm linking that up</P>\n","<P>25    with --</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43736 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness</P>\n","<P> 2    made the allegations here.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp</P>\n","<P> 4    near Bijeljina.  And I've linked that up to what the indictment against</P>\n","<P> 5    Mr. Seselj says.</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that's not relevant.  Move on.</P>\n","<P> 7            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused</P>\n","<P> 9    Mr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a</P>\n","<P>10    hundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?</P>\n","<P>11            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it's not relevant to</P>\n","<P>13    this case.</P>\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the</P>\n","<P>15    basis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks</P>\n","<P>16    about Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj's indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane</P>\n","<P>18    treatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's indictment?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the</P>\n","<P>23    International Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything</P>\n","<P>24    about this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   I don't know anything about the visit of the International Red</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43737 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Cross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.</P>\n","<P> 2    Also, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of</P>\n","<P> 3    prisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not</P>\n","<P> 4    take part in any such thing.</P>\n","<P> 5            As for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and</P>\n","<P> 6    if there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would</P>\n","<P> 7    have to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right.  I'm not going to ask you about this anymore.  You</P>\n","<P> 9    mentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is</P>\n","<P>10    that right?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the</P>\n","<P>13    activity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the</P>\n","<P>14    situation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,</P>\n","<P>15    do you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no</P>\n","<P>17    paramilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in</P>\n","<P>18    Mostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,</P>\n","<P>19    from the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>20    Party were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them</P>\n","<P>21    as highly disciplined on Belgrade television.</P>\n","<P>22            If there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have</P>\n","<P>23    been members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention</P>\n","<P>24    platoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not</P>\n","<P>25    preclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43738 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    was not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp</P>\n","<P> 3    there were Seselj's Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   That is absolutely impossible.  I've never heard of the White</P>\n","<P> 6    Eagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven't heard of this Buna</P>\n","<P> 7    camp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 8    Party, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared</P>\n","<P> 9    in Buna.  I don't know anything about this, but there should be proper</P>\n","<P>10    records to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White</P>\n","<P>11    Eagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any</P>\n","<P>12    Red Berets.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in</P>\n","<P>14    Nevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I</P>\n","<P>16    was in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and</P>\n","<P>17    in the Neretva valley.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in</P>\n","<P>20    Nevesinje.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   That will do.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable</P>\n","<P>23    number of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no</P>\n","<P>24    conflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large</P>\n","<P>25    number of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43739 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    were put up at various facilities there.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.

I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers</P>\n","<P> 6    of the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That's close to</P>\n","<P> 7    Konjic.  I've already said that there were members of the Serb guard</P>\n","<P> 8    there.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was</P>\n","<P> 9    there, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was</P>\n","<P>10    operating.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan's Serb</P>\n","<P>12    volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared</P>\n","<P>16    elsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities</P>\n","<P>17    had a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because</P>\n","<P>18    they stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then</P>\n","<P>19    they appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a</P>\n","<P>20    lot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic's.  As far as I</P>\n","<P>21    know, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>\n","<P>23       A.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav</P>\n","<P>24    Lajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43740 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   The Serb guard.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Of Vuk Draskovic?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from</P>\n","<P> 4    Novi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made</P>\n","<P> 6    to the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.

That is --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,</P>\n","<P> 7    because the overhead projector is not working.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further</P>\n","<P> 9    questions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except</P>\n","<P>10    for this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a</P>\n","<P>11    decision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were</P>\n","<P>12    presented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal</P>\n","<P>13    government said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was</P>\n","<P>14    known who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.</P>\n","<P>15    The 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.

This is a series of</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43744 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    articles from Ekspres Politika.  Can you see the date of the newspaper?</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of</P>\n","<P> 3    November.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   1991; right?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   1991.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Unless this is a leading question.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   It's illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one</P>\n","<P> 8    of the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when</P>\n","<P> 9    preparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.</P>\n","<P>10    That is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of</P>\n","<P>11    Evidence and Procedure.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the</P>\n","<P>13    subheading?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both</P>\n","<P>15    Serbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars</P>\n","<P>16    for a long time.  \"Light finally,\" is the heading.  And then in the</P>\n","<P>17    subheading:  \"Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas.\"  And then there's</P>\n","<P>18    another bit saying, \"In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,\"</P>\n","<P>19    and then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, \"I cannot believe</P>\n","<P>20    that we are alive,\" and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated</P>\n","<P>21    the town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.</P>\n","<P>22            THE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of</P>\n","<P>23    the question was not heard by the interpreters.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.

Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P> 2            And please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.</P>\n","<P> 5    Perhaps it's easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text</P>\n","<P> 6    is.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as</P>\n","<P> 8    follows:  \"A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total</P>\n","<P> 9    of 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity.\"</P>\n","<P>10    That's what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and</P>\n","<P>11    Croats equally.  Civilians, that is.</P>\n","<P>12            I can't read the first paragraph because it's quite illegible, but</P>\n","<P>13    it seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,</P>\n","<P>14    that several ambulances were waiting to help.  \"It would not be a good</P>\n","<P>15    thing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now.\"</P>\n","<P>16            So Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of</P>\n","<P>17    Vukovar before the fighting had stopped.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Can you see the subtitle which says \"The cruel major\"?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this</P>\n","<P>21    refers to and what it says about this cruel major.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians</P>\n","<P>23    very nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that</P>\n","<P>24    surprised this Croat woman, and he says:  \"No knows what she as a Croat</P>\n","<P>25    heard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers.\"  So he's describing the</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43746 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    behaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what</P>\n","<P> 2    Croatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very</P>\n","<P> 3    bad way.</P>\n","<P> 4            And then Major Sljivancanin says:  \"Whenever you need anything,</P>\n","<P> 5    look for me and I'll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to</P>\n","<P> 6    go, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full</P>\n","<P> 7    of gratitude.\"  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  \"He had</P>\n","<P> 8    followed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude.\"</P>\n","<P> 9            All this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now</P>\n","<P>10    Colonel Veselin Sljivancanin.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic</P>\n","<P>12    describes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, \"Take this</P>\n","<P>13    child to hospital immediately.\"</P>\n","<P>14       A.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, \"Take this child to the</P>\n","<P>15    hospital in Negoslavci right away,\" Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing</P>\n","<P>16    the ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  \"Let her be given</P>\n","<P>17    assistance and medicine.\"</P>\n","<P>18            A little later Vlatka's mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for</P>\n","<P>19    her daughter in the crowd.  \"Where is my child?  What have they done to</P>\n","<P>20    her?  Where have they taken her,\" Verica was crying out.</P>\n","<P>21            \"Don't be afraid.  She is in hospital,\" Sljivancanin said.  The</P>\n","<P>22    frightened woman didn't believe it.\"  This is followed by Dulovic's</P>\n","<P>23    comment:  \"Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA</P>\n","<P>24    soldiers.\"</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   And what does it say then?</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43747 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   \"Get into my car.  I'll take you to the hospital so you can see</P>\n","<P> 2    your child and reassure yourself that everything is all right.  They both</P>\n","<P> 3    entered the vehicle.  In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and</P>\n","<P> 4    dressed Vlatka's wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the</P>\n","<P> 5    daughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them.\"</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   So this is Dulovic's report from the Vukovar war theatre.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on</P>\n","<P> 9    the following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points</P>\n","<P>10    are.  This large title, this heading, that is.</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.  Now it's been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a</P>\n","<P>12    statement, \"I believed in the army.\"  And what's in the subtitle.  \"A</P>\n","<P>13    little less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in</P>\n","<P>14    Vukovar.\"  And then there's a quotation.</P>\n","<P>15       A.   \"We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the</P>\n","<P>16    guards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the</P>\n","<P>17    hospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims.\"</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   And look what it says in the article.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the</P>\n","<P>20    following:  \"In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and</P>\n","<P>21    barricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house</P>\n","<P>22    number 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,</P>\n","<P>23    Milos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.  A few days</P>\n","<P>24    later, the members of the guards burst into the cellar.  These were</P>\n","<P>25    members of the Croatian National Guard Corps.  Get out or we'll throw a</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43748 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    bomb in.  The Chetniks are coming.

Could you put some light on it?</P>\n","<P> 4            Look at the passages marked in yellow.  You don't have to read it</P>\n","<P> 5    all out, just a few passages.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.    \"Several of us -- or, rather, above us on the cemetery the guards</P>\n","<P> 7    members were stationed.  Milka Vidovic said, 'When they visited us in the</P>\n","<P> 8    cellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone's throats.  We</P>\n","<P> 9    Serbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the</P>\n","<P>10    only thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.  I</P>\n","<P>11    believed in our army and I believed they would arrive.'\"</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  What's the question in relation to this,</P>\n","<P>13    Mr. Milosevic?</P>\n","<P>14            MR.

Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic</P>\n","<P>22    said volunteers as part of JNA.

Can it be enlarged?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   \"With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making</P>\n","<P> 9    openings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze</P>\n","<P>10    through and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.

The following text or this one</P>\n","<P>19    again says the Knights of Vukovar, Major Borivoje Tesic's units on the</P>\n","<P>20    front line, and this is a large article which seems not to be by Dulovic,</P>\n","<P>21    but on the left-hand side there is a small one:  \"Brave commander falls,</P>\n","<P>22    Borovo Selo.\"  Would you look at the signature?  I believe it's by</P>\n","<P>23    Dulovic.  Could you scroll up?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   What does it say in the passage marked by yellow?</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43752 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   The initials \"JD\" mean Jovan Dulovic.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   And what does it say in this last passage?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- \"The inhabitants of the</P>\n","<P> 4    Crepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,</P>\n","<P> 5    who with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village</P>\n","<P> 6    and one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the</P>\n","<P> 7    highest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages.\"</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   And he was killed?</P>\n","<P> 9       A.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives</P>\n","<P>10    him.  Next page.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a</P>\n","<P>12    look?  I haven't had time to look at it all carefully.</P>\n","<P>13       A.   Yes.  There's a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of</P>\n","<P>14    November.  \"Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate</P>\n","<P>15    Vukovar.\"</P>\n","<P>16            In these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate</P>\n","<P>17    Vukovar, and five years later he's saying something completely different.</P>\n","<P>18             \"Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in</P>\n","<P>19    Vukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb.\"  And then it</P>\n","<P>20    says:  \"The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back,\" and so on</P>\n","<P>21    and so forth.</P>\n","<P>22            So this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the</P>\n","<P>23    JNA.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It's been circled.</P>\n","<P>25       A.   Yes.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43753 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   Very well.</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   The 4th of November, 1991.  \"For two days fierce fighting has not</P>\n","<P> 3    stopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in</P>\n","<P> 4    flames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of</P>\n","<P> 5    Njusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the</P>\n","<P> 6    Territorial Defence.  Advances by Territorial Defence units and volunteers</P>\n","<P> 7    from the direction of Trpinja stopped on the edge of Borovo Naselje.\"</P>\n","<P> 8            He then speaks of a Croatian mortar attack on Bobota [phoen] and</P>\n","<P> 9    so on.</P>\n","<P>10       Q.   Is this another report by Dulovic?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes, it's signed by Jovan Dulovic.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Is there anything else, any other report?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   I'm looking at another text here but I can't see whether it's by</P>\n","<P>14    Dulovic or not because it's not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian</P>\n","<P>15    volunteer guard but again a very favourable text.  I couldn't see -- I</P>\n","<P>16    can't see the name of the author here.  I can't see it on this page.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Is there anything else underneath, another report?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   \"Who are the volunteers,\" is the next title.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Well, I can't see anything anymore.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced</P>\n","<P>21    through the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is \"Through the holes</P>\n","<P>22    to the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>23    Unknown ammunition with inhumane bullets.\"</P>\n","<P>24            What happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used</P>\n","<P>25    weapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43754 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    because the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal</P>\n","<P> 2    organs.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I can't see what it says here in yellow, highlighted</P>\n","<P> 4    in yellow.</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It's Major Radic now</P>\n","<P> 6    who also stands accused in The Hague.  \"Throughout the month of October,</P>\n","<P> 7    the fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in</P>\n","<P> 8    the clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least</P>\n","<P> 9    one person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja</P>\n","<P>10    [phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in</P>\n","<P>11    that way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had</P>\n","<P>12    taken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.</P>\n","<P>13    The snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own</P>\n","<P>14    control and then a solution was found to move through the houses.\"</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic's article</P>\n","<P>16    again?</P>\n","<P>17       A.   Well, it's not legible but it is a series of articles by him.  We</P>\n","<P>18    can't find a signature here but quite obviously it is a series of articles</P>\n","<P>19    by him.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  Is that a series of articles to which you</P>\n","<P>21    referred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect</P>\n","<P>22    to Dulovic's testimony?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   Yes.  But this isn't the complete material.  My legal advisors</P>\n","<P>24    found many more texts of this kind and they quote them in extenso, and in</P>\n","<P>25    my submission I state my intention to disclose them in keeping with</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43755 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Rule 67 of the rules of evidence.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, I have one more question</P>\n","<P> 3    [as interpreted] -- Robinson, I have a question for you.  As my associates</P>\n","<P> 4    have managed to come by a set of these or at least photocopies of the</P>\n","<P> 5    papers from 1991 which Mr. Seselj refers to in his submission to the other</P>\n","<P> 6    side, the presentation of these photocopies, is that sufficient grounds</P>\n","<P> 7    for my request that they be accepted as exhibits, that Mr. Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 8    submission be accepted as an exhibit?</P>\n","<P> 9            MR. NICE:  Rather interesting issues, I think, arise on the</P>\n","<P>10    validity of these documents as exhibits, and it may be necessary to go</P>\n","<P>11    back and remind ourselves of what Mr. Dulovic himself said about these</P>\n","<P>12    matters.  So I would respectfully invite the Chamber to put that matter</P>\n","<P>13    back.  But may we see the -- may we have access to this material tonight</P>\n","<P>14    in copy form in any event?

[Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some</P>\n","<P>22    questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian</P>\n","<P>23    indictment, that have to do with the \"Rump Presidency\" as it's called</P>\n","<P>24    here.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  \"The Rump Presidency</P>\n","<P>25    carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies,\" and so on and so forth, \"had</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43649 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    effect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief.\"</P>\n","<P> 2            I'm not going to ask you to repeat what you've already said, but</P>\n","<P> 3    in relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of</P>\n","<P> 4    Serbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they</P>\n","<P> 5    not take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency</P>\n","<P> 6    of the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any</P>\n","<P> 7    objective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from</P>\n","<P> 8    carrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?</P>\n","<P> 9            The question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,</P>\n","<P>10    Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the</P>\n","<P>11    SFRY Presidency in Belgrade?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,</P>\n","<P>13    staying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was</P>\n","<P>14    never a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from</P>\n","<P>15    carrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped</P>\n","<P>16    coming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had</P>\n","<P>17    practically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe</P>\n","<P>18    Mesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying</P>\n","<P>19    that they could not come because they could not strike a balance in</P>\n","<P>20    relation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and</P>\n","<P>21    Montenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.</P>\n","<P>22            The representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were</P>\n","<P>23    not expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was</P>\n","<P>24    actually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display</P>\n","<P>25    such feelings at the time.  It's only when he left Belgrade and when he</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43650 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    came back to the Croatian parliament that he said, \"I've completed my</P>\n","<P> 2    duty.  Yugoslavia is no more.\"</P>\n","<P> 3            He pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.</P>\n","<P> 4    Also, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him</P>\n","<P> 5    sufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he</P>\n","<P> 6    condemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most</P>\n","<P> 7    cooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was</P>\n","<P> 8    what he was.</P>\n","<P> 9            I already said that according to the constitution of the then</P>\n","<P>10    Yugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one</P>\n","<P>11    single member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been</P>\n","<P>12    prevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could</P>\n","<P>13    have gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could</P>\n","<P>14    have refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the</P>\n","<P>15    Presidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the</P>\n","<P>16    Presidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed</P>\n","<P>17    within the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably</P>\n","<P>18    before Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a</P>\n","<P>19    Rump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of</P>\n","<P>20    a rump Presidency.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  \"Slobodan Milosevic,</P>\n","<P>24    in his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that</P>\n","<P>25    Yugoslavia was finished.\"</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43651 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            Please, you've got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I'm not</P>\n","<P> 2    going to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much</P>\n","<P> 3    time.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to</P>\n","<P> 4    here or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that</P>\n","<P> 5    Yugoslavia was finished?</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say</P>\n","<P> 7    that Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you</P>\n","<P> 8    never said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I</P>\n","<P> 9    remember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the</P>\n","<P>10    behaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went</P>\n","<P>11    through a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,</P>\n","<P>12    constitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,</P>\n","<P>13    but then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional</P>\n","<P>14    provision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases</P>\n","<P>15    to exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the</P>\n","<P>16    matter.</P>\n","<P>17            The leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never</P>\n","<P>18    did it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and</P>\n","<P>19    Croatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and</P>\n","<P>20    Macedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro</P>\n","<P>21    proclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting</P>\n","<P>22    of two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration</P>\n","<P>23    on your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>25            MR.

There's another allegation in</P>\n","<P> 5    that last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no</P>\n","<P> 6    longer be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask</P>\n","<P> 7    Mr. Seselj whether that is so.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember</P>\n","<P> 9    at that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian</P>\n","<P>10    public, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the</P>\n","<P>11    decisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that</P>\n","<P>12    Serbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation</P>\n","<P>13    when the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.</P>\n","<P>14            I would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there</P>\n","<P>15    was a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the</P>\n","<P>16    headquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long</P>\n","<P>17    debate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the</P>\n","<P>18    demand of the military to declare a state of emergency.</P>\n","<P>19            The top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the</P>\n","<P>20    behaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a</P>\n","<P>21    vote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.

It says the representatives on</P>\n","<P> 2    the Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,</P>\n","<P> 3    the autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of</P>\n","<P> 4    Kosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what</P>\n","<P> 5    was so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the</P>\n","<P> 6    Presidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also</P>\n","<P> 8    start the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven't got the document here</P>\n","<P> 9    so I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were</P>\n","<P>10    actually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already</P>\n","<P>11    started putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the</P>\n","<P>12    Presidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the</P>\n","<P>13    Presidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not</P>\n","<P>14    very constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the</P>\n","<P>15    Presidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,</P>\n","<P>16    or Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.</P>\n","<P>17    I think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been</P>\n","<P>18    recalled in the meantime.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that</P>\n","<P>20    session or before that session or in relation to that session I never</P>\n","<P>21    declared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did</P>\n","<P>22    they declare that Yugoslavia was finished?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   I've already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian</P>\n","<P>24    politicians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was</P>\n","<P>25    one of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43654 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    hard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.</P>\n","<P> 2            As for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in</P>\n","<P> 3    Montenegro either.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to</P>\n","<P> 5    normal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic</P>\n","<P> 6    was elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented</P>\n","<P> 7    Vojvodina at the time.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the</P>\n","<P> 9    Presidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started</P>\n","<P>10    working again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its</P>\n","<P>11    work.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of</P>\n","<P>12    Bosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil</P>\n","<P>13    Tupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new</P>\n","<P>14    crisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be</P>\n","<P>15    elected president of the Presidency.</P>\n","<P>16            There was a principle involved that the president of the</P>\n","<P>17    Presidency was elected from a different republican province every year but</P>\n","<P>18    nobody's election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic</P>\n","<P>19    did not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European</P>\n","<P>20    envoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to</P>\n","<P>21    elect him nevertheless.</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting</P>\n","<P>24    the preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from</P>\n","<P>25    those positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43655 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says</P>\n","<P> 2    that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and</P>\n","<P> 3    discussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between</P>\n","<P> 4    Serbia and Croatia?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I</P>\n","<P> 6    remember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what</P>\n","<P> 7    was skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching</P>\n","<P> 8    agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the</P>\n","<P> 9    Bosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a</P>\n","<P>10    situation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it</P>\n","<P>11    increasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the</P>\n","<P>12    country at the time.</P>\n","<P>13            At that time, I -- as I've already said, the presidents of the</P>\n","<P>14    presidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys</P>\n","<P>15    had actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach</P>\n","<P>16    agreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia</P>\n","<P>17    increasingly so.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through</P>\n","<P>19    what medium?</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully</P>\n","<P>21    being bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media</P>\n","<P>22    this kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were</P>\n","<P>23    already at that time being financed from the West by different Western</P>\n","<P>24    intelligence agencies, so that's the kind of media I'm talking about.  In</P>\n","<P>25    Belgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43656 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    federal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic</P>\n","<P> 2    government, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government</P>\n","<P> 3    in Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the</P>\n","<P> 4    Western powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante</P>\n","<P> 5    Markovic's government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible</P>\n","<P> 6    agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 7    together under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been</P>\n","<P> 8    eliminated.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at</P>\n","<P>12    one stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence</P>\n","<P>13    counsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest</P>\n","<P>14    collaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This</P>\n","<P>15    denies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of</P>\n","<P>16    Bosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted</P>\n","<P>17    into evidence and if not we will find this transcript.</P>\n","<P>18            However, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with</P>\n","<P>19    you as you were an active participant in all political events.  This</P>\n","<P>20    meeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the</P>\n","<P>21    division of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any</P>\n","<P>22    member of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning</P>\n","<P>23    of which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way</P>\n","<P>24    even indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43657 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    if Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 2    as an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as</P>\n","<P> 3    a constituent nation as they had been before in the previous</P>\n","<P> 4    constitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the</P>\n","<P> 5    first president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it</P>\n","<P> 6    was not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint</P>\n","<P> 7    state.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans</P>\n","<P> 8    persuaded him to call off the agreement.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It</P>\n","<P>10    says:  \"On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY</P>\n","<P>11    Presidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,</P>\n","<P>12    Sejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY</P>\n","<P>13    Presidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the</P>\n","<P>14    Presidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and</P>\n","<P>15    Macedonia.\"</P>\n","<P>16            On the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.

There was absolutely no takeover.

In paragraph 65 it says:  \"On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,</P>\n","<P> 7    Slobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal</P>\n","<P> 8    enterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from</P>\n","<P> 9    Belgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the</P>\n","<P>10    mobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay</P>\n","<P>11    in Yugoslavia.\"</P>\n","<P>12            First of all, let's establish when I began advocating a unitary</P>\n","<P>13    Serb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And</P>\n","<P>14    secondly, was this anyone's idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,</P>\n","<P>15    and is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever</P>\n","<P>16    been a unitary state?</P>\n","<P>17       A.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as</P>\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally</P>\n","<P>19    and your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt</P>\n","<P>20    the new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the</P>\n","<P>21    autonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the</P>\n","<P>22    Serb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of</P>\n","<P>23    autonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an</P>\n","<P>24    option.</P>\n","<P>25            Furthermore, when the four former federal units had already been</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43660 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    recognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the</P>\n","<P> 2    Montenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be</P>\n","<P> 3    promulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump</P>\n","<P> 4    Yugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would</P>\n","<P> 5    have been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -</P>\n","<P> 6    because that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary</P>\n","<P> 7    Serbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this</P>\n","<P> 8    but didn't want to, and I am sorry that you didn't do that, because up to</P>\n","<P> 9    the point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --</P>\n","<P>10    in Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It</P>\n","<P>11    appeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any</P>\n","<P>13    of my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who</P>\n","<P>14    were allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had</P>\n","<P>15    any kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated</P>\n","<P>17    with you advocated such an idea.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it</P>\n","<P>19    says here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of</P>\n","<P>20    reservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the</P>\n","<P>21    reasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was</P>\n","<P>22    called for?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   I'm not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation</P>\n","<P>24    of reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to</P>\n","<P>25    mobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43661 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    to take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the</P>\n","<P> 2    territorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that</P>\n","<P> 3    this mobilisation didn't go well.  The response was very poor, because</P>\n","<P> 4    Veljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn't want to remove the</P>\n","<P> 5    communist insignia from the military uniforms.</P>\n","<P> 6            The Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the</P>\n","<P> 7    Presidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was</P>\n","<P> 8    Prime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in</P>\n","<P> 9    Slovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of</P>\n","<P>10    such an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops</P>\n","<P>11    into Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then</P>\n","<P>12    leadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as</P>\n","<P>13    I know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership</P>\n","<P>14    which had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your</P>\n","<P>16    name, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask</P>\n","<P>17    you now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of</P>\n","<P>18    April, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan's and</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you</P>\n","<P>20    know anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and</P>\n","<P>21    cart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of</P>\n","<P>22    cooperation with Arkan's volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>24    did not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert</P>\n","<P>25    that, I'm saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43662 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    organised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as</P>\n","<P> 2    much as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.</P>\n","<P> 3    That's a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P> 4    Radical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty</P>\n","<P> 5    to Serbia.  I guarantee that.</P>\n","<P> 6            The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict</P>\n","<P> 7    instructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb</P>\n","<P> 8    volunteer guard up to the --</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm asking why was that instruction given to the</P>\n","<P>10    volunteers of the Serb Radical Party?</P>\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.</P>\n","<P>12    We didn't want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn't</P>\n","<P>13    want people's awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.</P>\n","<P>14            As I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,</P>\n","<P>15    long before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had</P>\n","<P>16    quarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was</P>\n","<P>17    in danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this</P>\n","<P>18    in the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding</P>\n","<P>20    that instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with</P>\n","<P>21    Arkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You're</P>\n","<P>22    not there with them.</P>\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can't say that not a single</P>\n","<P>24    volunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There's one</P>\n","<P>25    instance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43663 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    teacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 2    Party.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of</P>\n","<P> 3    about 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back</P>\n","<P> 4    but, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of</P>\n","<P> 5    Arkan's men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.</P>\n","<P> 6            So, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint</P>\n","<P> 7    military activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with</P>\n","<P> 8    Arkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a</P>\n","<P> 9    distance from Arkan.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.</P>\n","<P>11            Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on</P>\n","<P>14    transcript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia</P>\n","<P>15    took place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj's</P>\n","<P>16    White Eagles.</P>\n","<P>17            First of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and</P>\n","<P>18    secondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj's White Eagles?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb</P>\n","<P>20    people organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have</P>\n","<P>21    already said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of</P>\n","<P>22    volunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After</P>\n","<P>23    that, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we</P>\n","<P>24    had volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never</P>\n","<P>25    had anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43664 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            There was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo</P>\n","<P> 2    Selo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he</P>\n","<P> 3    was killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not</P>\n","<P> 4    carrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no</P>\n","<P> 5    joint military activities.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Let's clarify this.  It doesn't say here that you cooperated.  It</P>\n","<P> 7    says here:  \"With infiltration of Seselj's White Eagles.\"  So the White</P>\n","<P> 8    Eagles are being ascribed to you.</P>\n","<P> 9       A.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the</P>\n","<P>10    Prosecutor bringing witnesses here who don't no anything about what</P>\n","<P>11    happened on the ground.  It's simply nonsense to talk of a group called</P>\n","<P>12    Seselj's White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and</P>\n","<P>13    the Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn't know</P>\n","<P>14    what he was talking about.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,</P>\n","<P>16    2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that \"Seselj collected men in</P>\n","<P>17    Erdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia.\"  Is that</P>\n","<P>18    true, Mr. Seselj?</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493</P>\n","<P>20    who testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake</P>\n","<P>22    in my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that</P>\n","<P>23    particular page, and the page is 19003.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43665 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    them to Bosnia?</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in</P>\n","<P> 3    Erdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,</P>\n","<P> 4    nicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only</P>\n","<P> 5    time.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --</P>\n","<P> 6    we never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there</P>\n","<P> 7    either, and I can state that quite categorically.</P>\n","<P> 8            The people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the</P>\n","<P> 9    war and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were</P>\n","<P>10    exclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I</P>\n","<P>11    absolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan's centre in Erdut</P>\n","<P>12    later on.  We never had anything to do with it.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is</P>\n","<P>14    20294, says that Arkan's and Seselj's men shot above the heads of the</P>\n","<P>15    civilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in</P>\n","<P>16    Bratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who</P>\n","<P>17    mistreated and abused the civilians?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian</P>\n","<P>19    Radical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my</P>\n","<P>20    knowledge Arkan didn't appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in</P>\n","<P>21    Zvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in</P>\n","<P>22    Bratunac either.  And I've already said that in Bratunac there was</P>\n","<P>23    Deronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there</P>\n","<P>24    I was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have</P>\n","<P>25    very certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43666 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj's men were</P>\n","<P> 2    in Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 3    mean there is no difference, says he.</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can't see any</P>\n","<P> 5    difference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the</P>\n","<P> 6    White Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at</P>\n","<P> 7    all.  And that's not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some</P>\n","<P> 8    judgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to</P>\n","<P> 9    see in some other places Seselj's White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the</P>\n","<P>10    problem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses</P>\n","<P>11    which it manipulates.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on</P>\n","<P>13    several occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --</P>\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven't been able to check this myself</P>\n","<P>15    because the accused hasn't been getting the references correct, and it's</P>\n","<P>16    quite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I'm grateful to</P>\n","<P>17    Ms. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came</P>\n","<P>18    (redacted).</P>\n","<P>19    But, really, I'm afraid we've got to have correct references for the</P>\n","<P>20    witnesses.  We can't simply just go to the page in the transcript.</P>\n","<P>21    Frequently our page numbers don't necessarily coincide here in court, and</P>\n","<P>22    without reference to the witnesses it's very difficult to pick it up</P>\n","<P>23    later.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in</P>\n","<P>25    pinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you're referring.  Now,</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43667 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Judge Kwon has already corrected you once, and apparently there is another</P>\n","<P> 2    mistake in the reference.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, perhaps there might be a</P>\n","<P> 4    mistake with the name, but there is no mistake with the quotation from the</P>\n","<P> 5    transcript, and my question relates to the material facts which are being</P>\n","<P> 6    mentioned here.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, we have to follow it, Mr. Milosevic.  There</P>\n","<P> 8    is duty on you to be more careful.</P>\n","<P> 9            Please proceed.</P>\n","<P>10            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. Robinson.  And I'll</P>\n","<P>11    check this out to see whether indeed it is the same witness from</P>\n","<P>12    page 20352, the transcript line and page, the quotation that I mentioned</P>\n","<P>13    earlier on or, rather, 20351 is the exact number.  I'll check that out</P>\n","<P>14    during the break.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript</P>\n","<P>17    said that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of</P>\n","<P>18    March, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan's men took part as well as</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the</P>\n","<P>20    occupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on</P>\n","<P>21    the 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of</P>\n","<P>22    your volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What</P>\n","<P>24    happened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between</P>\n","<P>25    the JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43668 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Muslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.</P>\n","<P> 2    However, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went</P>\n","<P> 3    on for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting</P>\n","<P> 4    the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was</P>\n","<P> 5    there, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my</P>\n","<P> 6    knowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of</P>\n","<P> 7    the local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to</P>\n","<P> 8    establish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the</P>\n","<P> 9    ground there.</P>\n","<P>10            I know -- have reliable information that the commands and the</P>\n","<P>11    officers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan's and</P>\n","<P>12    the Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a</P>\n","<P>13    great deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very</P>\n","<P>14    rarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.</P>\n","<P>15            As far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,</P>\n","<P>16    over there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did</P>\n","<P>17    appear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the</P>\n","<P>18    call of Biljana Plavsic.  I can't prove that, but I do know that Biljana</P>\n","<P>19    Plavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly</P>\n","<P>20    meeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The</P>\n","<P>21    volunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina</P>\n","<P>22    were not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the</P>\n","<P>23    Serbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were</P>\n","<P>24    residents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the</P>\n","<P>25    conflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43669 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    and Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan's right-hand man.  And in</P>\n","<P> 2    Serbia we didn't send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something</P>\n","<P> 4    for me in relation to the Prosecution's case.  In the Bosnia indictment</P>\n","<P> 5    the allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other</P>\n","<P> 6    members of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the</P>\n","<P> 7    Prosecution case unfolded, you're not saying, are you, that he acted</P>\n","<P> 8    alone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with</P>\n","<P> 9    other members of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven't reviewed each and every allegation</P>\n","<P>11    to check that there isn't one there that may be susceptible to individual</P>\n","<P>12    perpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he's working with others.</P>\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually</P>\n","<P>16    your case.  It's not that he acted alone.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. NICE:  Subject to the point I've just made.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you've made, yes.</P>\n","<P>19            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Very well, Mr. Seselj.  You've just heard that explanation too.</P>\n","<P>23    Now, since you know the relationships very well between people at that</P>\n","<P>24    time, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and</P>\n","<P>25    Zvornik yourself.

NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and</P>\n","<P> 4    I think perhaps there's this qualification, although I don't think it is a</P>\n","<P> 5    qualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this</P>\n","<P> 6    accused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top</P>\n","<P> 7    political level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are</P>\n","<P> 8    criminal in nature.  It's the standard method of generation of</P>\n","<P> 9    genocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar</P>\n","<P>10    [phoen].</P>\n","<P>11            Now, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other</P>\n","<P>12    people.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may</P>\n","<P>13    be minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in</P>\n","<P>14    those circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting</P>\n","<P>15    alone in certain circumstances, but that's the only qualification I think</P>\n","<P>16    I should make.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it's a point that will warrant some</P>\n","<P>18    consideration later on, yes.</P>\n","<P>19            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>20            MR.

Did I or anybody</P>\n","<P>22    else from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all</P>\n","<P>23    and with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   I'm quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.</P>\n","<P>25    On the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43672 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    contacts with Arkan.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many</P>\n","<P> 3    questions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the</P>\n","<P> 4    evidence he's giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,</P>\n","<P> 5    how is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan</P>\n","<P> 6    or Mauzer?</P>\n","<P> 7            He's giving evidence.  He's saying that you had nothing to do with</P>\n","<P> 8    him.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to</P>\n","<P> 9    establish how he's in a position to make that statement.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that</P>\n","<P>12    cannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from</P>\n","<P>13    the authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or</P>\n","<P>14    relationship with Arkan or Mauzer?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   In Belgrade you couldn't hide anything like that.  It would be</P>\n","<P>16    impossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is</P>\n","<P>17    that kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become</P>\n","<P>18    public.</P>\n","<P>19            Second, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts</P>\n","<P>20    only with Zoran Djindjic.  And I've already spoken about the relationship</P>\n","<P>21    between Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic's vice-president and the</P>\n","<P>22    president of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his</P>\n","<P>23    pre-electoral campaign.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   Let's clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did</P>\n","<P>25    you have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43673 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    able to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in</P>\n","<P> 2    Bijeljina?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina</P>\n","<P> 4    sufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,</P>\n","<P> 5    including Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this</P>\n","<P> 6    trial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events</P>\n","<P> 7    that went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in</P>\n","<P> 8    Bijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements</P>\n","<P> 9    and held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and</P>\n","<P>10    severely criticised Mauzer's conduct, especially Mauzer's conduct towards</P>\n","<P>11    the Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am</P>\n","<P>12    preparing them for my own trial, which doesn't seem to be starting.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack</P>\n","<P>14    on the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the</P>\n","<P>15    JNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by</P>\n","<P>16    the Red Berets or, rather, Arkan's and Seselj's men.  So that's the</P>\n","<P>17    quotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan's</P>\n","<P>18    and Seselj's men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red</P>\n","<P>19    Berets were they?  What Arkan's men were they, Seselj's men were they</P>\n","<P>20    around Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the</P>\n","<P>22    witness don't seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened</P>\n","<P>23    to see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red</P>\n","<P>24    cap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.</P>\n","<P>25    And then he -- the witness doesn't know whether they were Seselj's men or</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43674 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Arkan's men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it's</P>\n","<P> 2    highly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of</P>\n","<P> 3    his head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify</P>\n","<P> 4    so-called Seselj's men and Arkan's men and these alleged Red Berets.</P>\n","<P> 5            As for the Red Berets, I've already given you reliable facts about</P>\n","<P> 6    them and said that name appeared in different situations relating to</P>\n","<P> 7    different military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina</P>\n","<P> 8    area where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then</P>\n","<P> 9    the army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of</P>\n","<P>10    the intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until</P>\n","<P>11    the special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of</P>\n","<P>12    Serbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this</P>\n","<P>13    misunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed</P>\n","<P>14    to people with -- which they had nothing to do with.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the</P>\n","<P>16    following:  \"Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P>17    who were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done.\"</P>\n","<P>18    That's when this witness claims.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He's a colonel by</P>\n","<P>20    rank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff</P>\n","<P>21    of the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the</P>\n","<P>22    number two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that's the same</P>\n","<P>23    Osman Selak that you're referring to.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   Well, I can't tell you that.</P>\n","<P>25       A.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43675 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a</P>\n","<P> 2    statement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,</P>\n","<P> 3    what the circumstances were in which I said it.</P>\n","<P> 4            I did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the</P>\n","<P> 5    secession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia</P>\n","<P> 6    seceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,</P>\n","<P> 7    and for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he</P>\n","<P> 8    personally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.</P>\n","<P> 9            As far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from</P>\n","<P>10    Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of</P>\n","<P>11    Yugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and</P>\n","<P>12    Raska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of</P>\n","<P>13    examples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army</P>\n","<P>14    perform their duty very honourably.</P>\n","<P>15            So the citizens --</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are</P>\n","<P>18    saying that you did make such a statement or you didn't make such a</P>\n","<P>19    statement.</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if</P>\n","<P>21    you don't show me something like that here, where and when.  Let us see</P>\n","<P>22    the statement concerned.  Let me identify it.  I gave thousands and</P>\n","<P>23    thousands of statements in public.  They were publicly recorded.  They</P>\n","<P>24    were published.  So let's see.</P>\n","<P>25            My objection is precisely in that.  Why did this Osman Selak not</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43676 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    say where and when?</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's helpful to some extent.  Does it follow from</P>\n","<P> 3    the answer you've just given that you could have said it?</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I could have said it along the</P>\n","<P> 5    following lines, that those in the army who came from the renegade</P>\n","<P> 6    republics in principle should not remain at positions in the Yugoslav</P>\n","<P> 7    army.  You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live</P>\n","<P> 8    in Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in</P>\n","<P> 9    the army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as</P>\n","<P>10    officers?</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's simply confusing me further.  The quote was</P>\n","<P>12    that you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims</P>\n","<P>13    and Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that</P>\n","<P>14    you could possibly have made that statement in these terms?</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not saying that I made that kind</P>\n","<P>16    of statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak</P>\n","<P>17    testified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise</P>\n","<P>18    lines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman</P>\n","<P>19    Selak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be</P>\n","<P>20    established.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the</P>\n","<P>21    Prosecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly</P>\n","<P>22    what I said.</P>\n","<P>23            I am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,</P>\n","<P>24    but it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you're asking me to do is</P>\n","<P>25    to comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43677 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Selak's view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make</P>\n","<P> 2    my statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm</P>\n","<P> 4    trying to understand the answer you've given to the question asked by</P>\n","<P> 5    Mr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you've just said, the problem is</P>\n","<P> 6    that you've been studying this yourself, and you're trying to justify a</P>\n","<P> 7    position of your own without really dealing specifically with the question</P>\n","<P> 8    that's being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears</P>\n","<P> 9    now to be that you couldn't possibly have made a statement of that nature,</P>\n","<P>10    although you might have said something much more specific about different</P>\n","<P>11    people but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.</P>\n","<P>12            Now, is that a fair summary of your position?</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I'm not sure, by think you're</P>\n","<P>14    very close.  However, in order to help you, I'm going to give you an</P>\n","<P>15    example.</P>\n","<P>16            Throughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were</P>\n","<P>17    informed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,</P>\n","<P>18    escaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of</P>\n","<P>19    confidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998</P>\n","<P>20    we had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of</P>\n","<P>21    the military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his</P>\n","<P>22    family abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives</P>\n","<P>23    there.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn't remotely sound as if it's</P>\n","<P>25    going to be at all helpful to me, so we'll proceed with Mr. Milosevic's</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43678 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    questions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you</P>\n","<P> 2    was about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist</P>\n","<P> 3    statement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple</P>\n","<P> 4    issue I'm not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further</P>\n","<P> 5    if he wishes.</P>\n","<P> 6            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in</P>\n","<P>11    no uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that</P>\n","<P>12    any statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never</P>\n","<P>13    in my life have I made a racist statement.</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>\n","<P>19            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  There's nothing for you to respond to.</P>\n","<P>21            Mr. Milosevic, the next question.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I'm afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I</P>\n","<P>24    put a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific</P>\n","<P>25    terms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43679 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    here that \"Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 2    who were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed.\"  Did you ever state</P>\n","<P> 3    that?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I didn't say it that way.</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   So you didn't say it that way --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... matter.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  And why on earth it should take all this time to</P>\n","<P> 8    establish that simple issue, I do not know.</P>\n","<P> 9            Perhaps it would help, Mr. Seselj, if you just listened to the</P>\n","<P>10    questions and answer the question that's actually asked rather than try to</P>\n","<P>11    make political statements about your own position.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic --</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not making political statements,</P>\n","<P>14    Mr. Bonomy.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He</P>\n","<P>17    mentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether</P>\n","<P>18    those facts are correct.  And first of all, I'm interested in the</P>\n","<P>19    circumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  \"Just after</P>\n","<P>20    the bombing Seselj came to Pale.\"  And then on page 26762 he</P>\n","<P>21    says:  \"Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to</P>\n","<P>22    support the Bosnian Serbs.\"  These are a few facts that referred to.</P>\n","<P>23    Could you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this</P>\n","<P>24    actually all about?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43680 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the</P>\n","<P> 2    leadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly</P>\n","<P> 3    engaged in an anti-Serb policy.</P>\n","<P> 4            As for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market</P>\n","<P> 5    itself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the</P>\n","<P> 6    street of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these</P>\n","<P> 7    are explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of</P>\n","<P> 8    whether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar</P>\n","<P> 9    shells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.</P>\n","<P>10            This was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the</P>\n","<P>11    Serbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the</P>\n","<P>12    threats that were made, and so on and so forth.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there</P>\n","<P>14    you did so only to give political support to the leadership of</P>\n","<P>15    Republika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and</P>\n","<P>16    bombing.</P>\n","<P>17       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  \"In January or February</P>\n","<P>19    1992\" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, \"Arkan's</P>\n","<P>20    and Seselj's units arrived in Doboj.\"</P>\n","<P>21            Is this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?</P>\n","<P>22       A.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,</P>\n","<P>23    there were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.</P>\n","<P>24            Secondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to</P>\n","<P>25    Doboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan's Tigers never</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43681 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    operated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to</P>\n","<P> 3    this question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript page 27738, quite explicitly, \"Mirko Blagojevic,\" that is to</P>\n","<P> 5    say, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he</P>\n","<P> 6    says:  \"Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,</P>\n","<P> 7    and he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with</P>\n","<P> 8    Seselj.\"</P>\n","<P> 9            I am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>10    Party or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that</P>\n","<P>11    Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So</P>\n","<P>12    please deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the</P>\n","<P>13    transcript.  Is it correct or not?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is</P>\n","<P>15    organised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A</P>\n","<P>16    conflict occurs when two armed formations clash.</P>\n","<P>17            Mirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in</P>\n","<P>18    Bijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim</P>\n","<P>19    formations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any</P>\n","<P>20    conflicts.

Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  \"Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 3    men tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm.\"</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   My understanding is it's somewhere near Zvornik.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   That's quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 7    Party took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there</P>\n","<P> 8    in brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on</P>\n","<P> 9    for a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the</P>\n","<P>10    Muslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to</P>\n","<P>11    an end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>12    withdrew.</P>\n","<P>13            I preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on</P>\n","<P>14    guarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing</P>\n","<P>15    happened, I would have had to know about it.</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you</P>\n","<P>17    personally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following</P>\n","<P>18    circumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  \"Seselj,</P>\n","<P>19    on Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired</P>\n","<P>20    it at Muslims in Sarajevo.\"  This was shown on television, and he said</P>\n","<P>21    that you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at</P>\n","<P>23    Grbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called</P>\n","<P>24    international observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go</P>\n","<P>25    around the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43684 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Serb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was</P>\n","<P> 2    an apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I</P>\n","<P> 3    used a Browning machine-gun from there.  It's a heavy machine-gun.  I</P>\n","<P> 4    couldn't carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry</P>\n","<P> 5    it around.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   You cannot carry it.  It's too long.  It was installed in that</P>\n","<P> 8    building, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches</P>\n","<P> 9    below the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of</P>\n","<P>10    the volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was</P>\n","<P>11    firing from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and</P>\n","<P>12    the top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is</P>\n","<P>13    something I don't know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who</P>\n","<P>14    could have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this</P>\n","<P>15    small participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.</P>\n","<P>16            A Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that</P>\n","<P>17    case, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been</P>\n","<P>18    forced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of</P>\n","<P>19    those who in violation of international law of war brought him out there</P>\n","<P>20    to dig trenches, not those who --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,</P>\n","<P>24    that at the beginning of April Seselj's men arrived in the area of</P>\n","<P>25    Bratunac and Zvornik.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43685 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic's part.  He knows</P>\n","<P> 2    full well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing</P>\n","<P> 3    who he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and</P>\n","<P> 4    making this sweeping statement Seselj's men arrived in Bratunac and</P>\n","<P> 5    Zvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it's as if they were in Bratunac</P>\n","<P> 6    too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so</P>\n","<P> 7    Deronjic invented that.</P>\n","<P> 8            In Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the</P>\n","<P> 9    Bratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was</P>\n","<P>10    commander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he</P>\n","<P>11    was not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,</P>\n","<P>12    then a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.

No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in</P>\n","<P> 2    Bratunac.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   All right.  So you are saying that he's not telling the truth.</P>\n","<P> 4            The same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not</P>\n","<P> 5    agree that Seselj was a true opposition.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   The Hague OTP and Judge Schomburg on several occasions caught</P>\n","<P> 7    Deronjic lying.

This</P>\n","<P> 7    was Witness 1070.</P>\n","<P> 8            On page 20351 he says that Seselj's men were in Bratunac and that</P>\n","<P> 9    there was no difference between them and Seselj's men, the White Eagles,</P>\n","<P>10    that is.</P>\n","<P>11            And on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April</P>\n","<P>12    Seselj's and Arkan's men were in Bratunac together when some people were</P>\n","<P>13    deported.  And Mr. Seselj answered questions about this.  In the meantime,</P>\n","<P>14    the liaison officer had the transcript, and I have received a note saying</P>\n","<P>15    that both references are correct, both as regards page 20351 and 20352,</P>\n","<P>16    and these refer to Witness 1070.

MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   Mr. Seselj, this is the testimony of Miroslav Deronjic, who said</P>\n","<P>21    that you were not truly an opposition politician or, rather, that you</P>\n","<P>22    cooperated with the government and that therefore this idea of a joint</P>\n","<P>23    criminal enterprise is thereby confirmed.  Were you in the opposition or</P>\n","<P>24    not?</P>\n","<P>25            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43688 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it</P>\n","<P> 2    on.</P>\n","<P> 3            Both the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time</P>\n","<P> 4    were distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as</P>\n","<P> 5    it's possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by</P>\n","<P> 6    Deronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the</P>\n","<P> 7    opposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint</P>\n","<P> 8    often expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various</P>\n","<P> 9    government and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person</P>\n","<P>10    of the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or</P>\n","<P>11    Miles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery</P>\n","<P>12    and so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while</P>\n","<P>13    criticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition</P>\n","<P>14    politicians, and this logic is completely upside down.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Witness Ahmet Zulic says, and that's on page 30000 of the</P>\n","<P>17    transcript, he says that Seselj's men were stationed in the partisan</P>\n","<P>18    cemetery in Pobrezje, that doesn't matter so much but what matters is the</P>\n","<P>19    following, that they had come there to kill the Muslims.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Where is this place?  Pobrezje?  Where is it?</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   I have a note here in Pobrezje.

No.  Nowhere did the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party go to</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43689 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    kill Muslims or Croats or any kind of civilians.

I'm not sure whether Mr. Nice or Mr. Kay can help.  Your note</P>\n","<P> 6    doesn't identify clearly the name of this place?</P>\n","<P> 7            MR. NICE:  I tried to make an electronic search but for various</P>\n","<P> 8    reasons it doesn't work at the moment or doesn't work for this witness on</P>\n","<P> 9    this particular part of his evidence.  I'll try again.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  You said Pobrezje.</P>\n","<P>12            Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   The same witness, Ahmet Zulic, on page 30047, says in Sanski Most</P>\n","<P>15    there was no fighting, but the civilians fled because Seselj's men were</P>\n","<P>16    there.</P>\n","<P>17            Your men caused fear among civilians, although there was no</P>\n","<P>18    fighting there, as he says, in Sanski Most.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,</P>\n","<P>20    throughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did</P>\n","<P>21    not fight in any location.</P>\n","<P>22            This reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a</P>\n","<P>23    certain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying</P>\n","<P>24    that sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.</P>\n","<P>25    Somebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43690 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    arriving, and he spread panic.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that the Serbian word for</P>\n","<P> 3    sugar resembles Mr. Seselj's name.</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere</P>\n","<P> 5    in that area.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  \"From the</P>\n","<P> 8    1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan</P>\n","<P> 9    Milosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint</P>\n","<P>10    criminal,\" and so on,\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise</P>\n","<P>11    aided and abetted,\" and so on and so forth, all these phrases, \"the</P>\n","<P>12    planning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories</P>\n","<P>13    of Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>\n","<P>14    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.\"</P>\n","<P>15            Tell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in</P>\n","<P>16    this joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged</P>\n","<P>17    crimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made</P>\n","<P>18    here?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from</P>\n","<P>20    Serbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia</P>\n","<P>21    and Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted</P>\n","<P>22    to proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the</P>\n","<P>23    will of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the</P>\n","<P>24    West who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or</P>\n","<P>25    execution or extermination.  There was no plan.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43691 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            When the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in</P>\n","<P> 2    many places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only</P>\n","<P> 3    where the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats</P>\n","<P> 4    were in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,</P>\n","<P> 5    not a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the</P>\n","<P> 6    majority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They</P>\n","<P> 7    had already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we</P>\n","<P> 9    have already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the</P>\n","<P>10    other places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>\n","<P>11    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in</P>\n","<P>12    any kind of military activities?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in</P>\n","<P>14    January, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but</P>\n","<P>15    the UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,</P>\n","<P>16    although they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was</P>\n","<P>17    established, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be</P>\n","\n","<P>18    disarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.</P>\n","<P>19            The Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian</P>\n","<P>20    villages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there</P>\n","<P>21    were two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active</P>\n","<P>22    in the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces</P>\n","<P>23    in the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the</P>\n","<P>24    only activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica</P>\n","<P>25    area.  It was in the beginning of 1993.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43692 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            As for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,</P>\n","<P> 2    I don't know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up</P>\n","<P> 3    only in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all</P>\n","<P> 4    over Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army</P>\n","<P> 5    of the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska</P>\n","<P> 6    Krajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his</P>\n","<P> 7    volunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars</P>\n","<P> 8    there, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed</P>\n","<P>10    and what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy</P>\n","<P>11    that we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in</P>\n","<P>12    whole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and</P>\n","<P>13    Herzegovina?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and</P>\n","<P>15    there was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen</P>\n","<P>16    happened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on</P>\n","<P>17    their own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit</P>\n","<P>18    murders or anything of the kind.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war</P>\n","<P>20    in Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the</P>\n","<P>21    other participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by</P>\n","<P>22    Mr. Nice.</P>\n","<P>23            Look at paragraph 33.

You</P>\n","<P> 2    know the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that</P>\n","<P> 3    referred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded</P>\n","<P> 4    in any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted</P>\n","<P> 6    to, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A</P>\n","<P> 7    civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally</P>\n","<P> 8    wanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a</P>\n","<P> 9    constituent people.</P>\n","<P>10            And the question arises from there where are the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>11    Mostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>12    Travnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>13    many other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats</P>\n","<P>14    during that civil war?</P>\n","<P>15            After the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the</P>\n","<P>16    population, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did</P>\n","<P>17    take place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,</P>\n","<P>18    in figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I</P>\n","<P>19    can put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes</P>\n","<P>20    crimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,</P>\n","<P>21    sometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,</P>\n","<P>22    criminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and</P>\n","<P>23    revenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes</P>\n","<P>24    did not exist.  That did not happen.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43696 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    joint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I'd like</P>\n","<P> 2    to draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of</P>\n","<P> 3    December, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33</P>\n","<P> 4    and indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns</P>\n","<P> 5    are repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns</P>\n","<P> 6    too.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.</P>\n","<P> 7            So what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during</P>\n","<P> 8    that period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of</P>\n","<P> 9    December 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring</P>\n","<P>10    Bosnia and Herzegovina?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia</P>\n","<P>12    or, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of</P>\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It</P>\n","<P>14    did not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help</P>\n","<P>15    materially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs</P>\n","<P>16    living over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different</P>\n","<P>17    political relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership</P>\n","<P>18    of Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in</P>\n","<P>19    which those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep</P>\n","<P>20    conflicts, and they didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues.</P>\n","<P>21            So throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the</P>\n","<P>22    indictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,</P>\n","<P>23    the leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered</P>\n","<P>24    in looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far</P>\n","<P>25    accepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43697 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    attacked ourselves for our part.</P>\n","<P> 2            So I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy</P>\n","<P> 3    dating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact</P>\n","<P> 4    that that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all</P>\n","<P> 5    costs.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no</P>\n","<P> 6    alternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at</P>\n","<P> 7    the price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept</P>\n","<P> 8    because they were not able to take such great concessions.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities</P>\n","<P>10    of that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these</P>\n","<P>11    towns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I</P>\n","<P>12    personally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,</P>\n","<P>13    et cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason</P>\n","<P>14    explanation?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Yes, I do, and that's explanation is the following and the fact</P>\n","<P>16    that through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,</P>\n","<P>17    and --</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not</P>\n","<P>19    an explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.</P>\n","<P>20            So please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,</P>\n","<P>23    Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac</P>\n","<P>24    again, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in</P>\n","<P>25    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43698 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with</P>\n","<P> 2    regard to that point of the indictment?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised</P>\n","<P> 4    crime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don't know whether in all the</P>\n","<P> 5    places enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took</P>\n","<P> 6    place in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each</P>\n","<P> 7    individual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the</P>\n","<P> 8    motives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are</P>\n","<P> 9    still living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can</P>\n","<P>10    be established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side</P>\n","<P>11    and the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to</P>\n","<P>12    investigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to</P>\n","<P>13    strike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the</P>\n","<P>14    number of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you've said when you said</P>\n","<P>16    that some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let's look at</P>\n","<P>17    that for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of</P>\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or</P>\n","<P>19    formations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes</P>\n","<P>20    that you know of?  Are there any links?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of</P>\n","<P>22    power and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as</P>\n","<P>23    well, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,</P>\n","<P>24    the Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the</P>\n","<P>25    Academy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43699 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    everybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out</P>\n","<P> 2    against them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for</P>\n","<P> 3    freedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were</P>\n","<P> 4    being perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes</P>\n","<P> 5    should be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind</P>\n","<P> 6    via the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political</P>\n","<P> 7    parties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which</P>\n","<P> 8    strove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors</P>\n","<P> 9    spoke out against crimes.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>11            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Now, we -- let's look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful</P>\n","<P>13    confinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,</P>\n","<P>14    Bosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the</P>\n","<P>15    territories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,</P>\n","<P>16    Samac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,</P>\n","<P>17    Kotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,</P>\n","<P>18    Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>19            Tell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these</P>\n","<P>20    people in these towns did we take part in?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have</P>\n","<P>22    had anything to do with any such thing.</P>\n","<P>23            First of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What</P>\n","<P>24    the confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of</P>\n","<P>25    civilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43700 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    unlawful, and there were such cases.</P>\n","<P> 2            Now, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of</P>\n","<P> 3    all, there were individual instances in some of these places through the</P>\n","<P> 4    self-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance</P>\n","<P> 5    of Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.</P>\n","<P> 6    And then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of</P>\n","<P> 7    their own because they couldn't influence him.  He appeared as a factor,</P>\n","<P> 8    and there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his</P>\n","<P> 9    motives were of a criminal nature.</P>\n","<P>10            There were other such cases in some of these places whereby</P>\n","<P>11    somebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in</P>\n","<P>12    order to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive</P>\n","<P>13    money and then release them once they received money for that.  There were</P>\n","<P>14    also instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,</P>\n","<P>15    somebody's family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or</P>\n","<P>16    Croats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often</P>\n","<P>17    were not able to prevent revenge of that kind.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Which authorities?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian</P>\n","<P>21    authorities intervene?</P>\n","<P>22       A.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn't influence or involve</P>\n","<P>23    themselves in any such matters.</P>\n","<P>24            So as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one</P>\n","<P>25    should take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43701 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    those cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and</P>\n","<P> 2    what the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.</P>\n","<P> 3            Now, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places</P>\n","<P> 4    where possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of</P>\n","<P> 5    context and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse</P>\n","<P> 6    top-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian</P>\n","<P> 7    Yugoslavia as well.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has</P>\n","<P> 9    become a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you</P>\n","<P>10    say that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing</P>\n","<P>11    like the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged</P>\n","<P>12    by the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn't understand me correctly,</P>\n","<P>14    Mr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,</P>\n","<P>15    but there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top</P>\n","<P>16    echelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely</P>\n","<P>17    impossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like</P>\n","<P>18    that, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is</P>\n","<P>19    impossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such</P>\n","<P>20    thing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did</P>\n","<P>21    commit crimes.  And it wasn't only individuals who committed crimes.</P>\n","<P>22    There was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.</P>\n","<P>23    And I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my</P>\n","<P>24    information, but I can't be well-versed in everything, but I can in</P>\n","<P>25    basics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43702 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    wasn't the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit</P>\n","<P> 2    crimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn't the policy of the</P>\n","<P> 3    leadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.</P>\n","<P> 4            Now, --</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn't the policy of this accused in</P>\n","<P> 6    concert with other --</P>\n","<P> 7            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of</P>\n","<P> 8    Mr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,</P>\n","<P> 9    continuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such</P>\n","<P>10    crimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the</P>\n","<P>11    most serious form of war crimes.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There's an enormous</P>\n","<P>15    list of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,</P>\n","<P>16    and the subject here is deportation.</P>\n","<P>17            Now, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let's clarify that.  Albeit in</P>\n","<P>18    Serbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,</P>\n","<P>19    Muslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,</P>\n","<P>20    70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle</P>\n","<P>21    of non-discrimination like anybody else.</P>\n","<P>22            Now, I can't clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is</P>\n","<P>23    being accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it</P>\n","<P>24    stated here -- it says:  \"Milosevic, acting alone or together with other</P>\n","<P>25    members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43703 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or</P>\n","<P> 2    execution of the unlawful forcible transfer...\"</P>\n","<P> 3            Now, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic</P>\n","<P> 4    of Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or</P>\n","<P> 5    unlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful</P>\n","<P> 6    movement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one</P>\n","<P> 7    individual?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with</P>\n","<P> 9    anything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these</P>\n","<P>10    phenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what</P>\n","<P>11    did happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group</P>\n","<P>12    to leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that</P>\n","<P>13    desire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were</P>\n","<P>14    instances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,</P>\n","<P>15    that people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,</P>\n","<P>16    something afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind</P>\n","<P>17    what had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to</P>\n","<P>18    move out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or</P>\n","<P>19    perhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they</P>\n","<P>20    were the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and</P>\n","<P>21    in some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established</P>\n","<P>22    in some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete</P>\n","<P>23    example, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from</P>\n","<P>24    Prijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a</P>\n","<P>25    convoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43704 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I'm stopping you because you have</P>\n","<P> 2    answered the question.

I'm talking about one example when Muslims were transported</P>\n","<P> 8    because they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And</P>\n","<P> 9    then the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose</P>\n","<P>10    name is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is</P>\n","<P>11    called Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large</P>\n","<P>12    group of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the</P>\n","<P>13    authorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part</P>\n","<P>14    of Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army</P>\n","<P>15    of Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.</P>\n","<P>16            Then he tried to explain this in a completely different way:</P>\n","<P>17    Somebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he's</P>\n","<P>18    trying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.</P>\n","<P>19            Such people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,</P>\n","<P>20    entered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and</P>\n","<P>21    then they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed</P>\n","<P>22    although they are invariably false because --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm stopping you.

Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of</P>\n","<P>15    Serbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and</P>\n","<P>16    that as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon</P>\n","<P>17    what do you base this statement?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I</P>\n","<P>19    base my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent</P>\n","<P>20    statements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.</P>\n","<P>21            Secondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.</P>\n","<P>22    They never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never</P>\n","<P>23    discriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the</P>\n","<P>24    authorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in</P>\n","<P>25    Bosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43706 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43707 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    and treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.</P>\n","<P> 2            So there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic</P>\n","<P> 3    whatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution</P>\n","<P> 4    of Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in</P>\n","<P> 5    Serbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal</P>\n","<P> 6    of money.

No.  Even if there were any incidents on ethnic grounds, the</P>\n","<P>12    authorities acted in accordance with the law and brought such matters to</P>\n","<P>13    trial.  They simply did not allow things like that to happen.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Please look at paragraph 42 now.

This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in</P>\n","<P> 8    any way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of</P>\n","<P> 9    private and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three</P>\n","<P>10    sides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything</P>\n","<P>11    under control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.</P>\n","<P>12            What happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims</P>\n","<P>13    would loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have</P>\n","<P>14    their own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar</P>\n","<P>15    way in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no</P>\n","<P>16    official authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No</P>\n","<P>17    one personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,</P>\n","<P>18    et cetera.</P>\n","<P>19            There were paramilitary formations that had looting as their</P>\n","<P>20    primary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also</P>\n","<P>21    from Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People</P>\n","<P>22    travelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize</P>\n","<P>23    their car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were</P>\n","<P>24    such cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial</P>\n","<P>25    Chamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43709 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    looting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions</P>\n","<P> 2    that were rather chaotic.</P>\n","<P> 3            There was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.</P>\n","<P> 4    Not only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika</P>\n","<P> 5    Srpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in</P>\n","<P> 7    a military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto</P>\n","<P> 8    civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and</P>\n","<P> 9    wounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.</P>\n","<P>10            You were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please</P>\n","<P>11    explain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,</P>\n","<P>12    tell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of</P>\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.</P>\n","<P>14       A.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a</P>\n","<P>15    dissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict</P>\n","<P>16    in Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of</P>\n","<P>17    the duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case</P>\n","<P>18    elsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on</P>\n","<P>19    both sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less</P>\n","<P>20    casualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what</P>\n","<P>21    Judge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I</P>\n","<P>22    read.</P>\n","<P>23            I was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the</P>\n","<P>24    killing of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted</P>\n","<P>25    intentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43710 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Muslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present</P>\n","<P> 2    this in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,</P>\n","<P> 3    Vasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not</P>\n","<P> 4    take part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official</P>\n","<P> 5    factors from Serbia, that is.</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.

MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or</P>\n","<P>15    deny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took</P>\n","<P>16    part in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you</P>\n","<P>17    confirm that?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   All right.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The</P>\n","<P>21    Muslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the</P>\n","<P>22    liberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his</P>\n","<P>24    witness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,</P>\n","<P>25    including women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43711 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only</P>\n","<P> 2    logical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee</P>\n","<P> 3    from war.  They're fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.</P>\n","<P> 4            Very often in this war and in any other war civilians would get</P>\n","<P> 5    killed by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from</P>\n","<P> 6    the conflict.</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the</P>\n","<P> 8    Serbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it's supposed</P>\n","<P> 9    to seem?</P>\n","<P>10       A.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray</P>\n","<P>11    this, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their</P>\n","<P>12    victims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We</P>\n","<P>13    are faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is</P>\n","<P>14    based and anti-Serb grounds.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings</P>\n","<P>16    happened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all</P>\n","<P>17    of that can be found here in this indictment that I've been quoting to</P>\n","<P>18    you, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to</P>\n","<P>20    give.  Ask another question.</P>\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a</P>\n","<P>22    question to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that</P>\n","<P>23    he can give an answer.  He's a politician, an intellectual, a university</P>\n","<P>24    professor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,</P>\n","<P>25    and he is in a position to give an answer to this question.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43712 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And I've already ruled that he is not to answer</P>\n","<P> 2    it.  So proceed.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the</P>\n","<P> 6    JNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know</P>\n","<P> 7    about that?  This is on transcript page 20408.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The</P>\n","<P> 9    two sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the</P>\n","<P>10    bridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric</P>\n","<P>11    power plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to</P>\n","<P>12    destroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old</P>\n","<P>13    hydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the</P>\n","<P>14    paramilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The</P>\n","<P>15    conflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can't say exactly, I</P>\n","<P>16    wasn't there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And</P>\n","<P>17    then also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units</P>\n","<P>19    committed crimes in Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there</P>\n","<P>21    that can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but</P>\n","<P>22    who it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are</P>\n","<P>23    ascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to</P>\n","<P>24    Karadzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.</P>\n","<P>25            In Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43713 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    people for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing</P>\n","<P> 5    them, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They</P>\n","<P> 6    are mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided</P>\n","<P> 7    by Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,</P>\n","<P> 8    Drinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you</P>\n","<P> 9    heard anything about this and what do you know about it?</P>\n","<P>10       A.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my</P>\n","<P>11    knowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but</P>\n","<P>12    once the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very</P>\n","<P>13    simply, who the victims were and who the executors were.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the</P>\n","<P>15    cultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many</P>\n","<P>16    persons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force</P>\n","<P>17    there is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I'll just go</P>\n","<P>18    on.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were</P>\n","<P>20    committed.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn't the JNA that</P>\n","<P>21    took part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take</P>\n","<P>22    part in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully</P>\n","<P>23    investigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims</P>\n","<P>24    are still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether</P>\n","<P>25    there was enough will to investigate this matter, and I've already</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43714 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    referred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect</P>\n","<P> 2    a great deal from that.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I don't know anything about it.

Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment</P>\n","<P>14    in this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your</P>\n","<P>15    units.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan's men.  Do</P>\n","<P>16    you have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your</P>\n","<P>17    units were there?  You've already explained you didn't have any units of</P>\n","<P>18    yours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers</P>\n","<P>19    were there?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I'm not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik</P>\n","<P>21    area.  I know that Arkan's Tigers were active there but to what extent and</P>\n","<P>22    in what locations I couldn't say because I wasn't there.</P>\n","<P>23            All the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I</P>\n","<P>24    do not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and</P>\n","<P>25    misfortunes he talked about, but evidently he's very confused when</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43715 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    identifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He's mixing up Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 2    men, the White Eagles, Arkan's men, and this shows that he's very confused</P>\n","<P> 3    and unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers</P>\n","<P> 4    of the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to</P>\n","<P> 5    everything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very</P>\n","<P> 6    often it's beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn't be easy to</P>\n","<P> 7    establish who actually perpetrated this.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a</P>\n","<P> 9    certain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the</P>\n","<P>10    transcript.  Do you know anything about this?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>12    committed any crimes in that place.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>14    Radical Party?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>16    sent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,</P>\n","<P>17    and as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me</P>\n","<P>18    had any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I'm sure of it.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Would other volunteers have reported this?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and</P>\n","<P>21    they would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,</P>\n","<P>22    because this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about</P>\n","<P>24    the conducts of the volunteers?</P>\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn't say the reports were</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43716 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    regular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out</P>\n","<P> 2    how the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All</P>\n","<P> 3    the problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of</P>\n","<P> 4    indiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers</P>\n","<P> 5    to be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline</P>\n","<P> 6    of the other men.</P>\n","<P> 7            I was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the</P>\n","<P> 8    conclusion that none occurred.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral</P>\n","<P>11    conversations.</P>\n","<P>12            I'm convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written</P>\n","<P>13    reports would have been sent to me.  I'm sure that the competent command</P>\n","<P>14    would have told me had something like this happened.</P>\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>16            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Mr. Seselj, if you can't recall it doesn't matter, but is it true</P>\n","<P>18    that in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,</P>\n","<P>19    1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of</P>\n","<P>20    Seselj's men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj's men, then</P>\n","<P>22    should be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell</P>\n","<P>23    you whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group</P>\n","<P>24    of Seselj's men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he's</P>\n","<P>25    the leader if they don't know his name?  What does the term \"leader\" mean?</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43717 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Was he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times</P>\n","<P> 2    that volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in</P>\n","<P> 3    units larger than a company.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I</P>\n","<P> 6    have a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I</P>\n","<P> 7    wanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the</P>\n","<P> 8    indictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no</P>\n","<P> 9    such instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>10    Party.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such</P>\n","<P>14    instances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various</P>\n","<P>15    allegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of</P>\n","<P>16    time.</P>\n","<P>17            Please tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about</P>\n","<P>18    the events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men</P>\n","<P>19    participated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.</P>\n","<P>20       A.

MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Well, that's the only reason I asked you whether you knew</P>\n","<P>15    anything.</P>\n","<P>16       A.   In paragraph 42 Bosanski Samac is ascribed to you.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Well, all the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are</P>\n","<P>18    ascribed to me.  There aren't any which are not ascribed to me.  But what</P>\n","<P>19    do you know about the events there?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I don't understand this question.  You</P>\n","<P>21    can't just ask a question, take a municipality and say, \"What do you know</P>\n","<P>22    about events there?\"  There's got to be some point to the question.</P>\n","<P>23            Now, what is this dealing with?</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Very well.  I won't ask you anything about that, then, because I</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43720 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    can't find the reference now.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, Mr. Milosevic.

Don't assume</P>\n","<P>11    that because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he's the</P>\n","<P>12    best person to contradict it.</P>\n","<P>13            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.</P>\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   On page 23520 of the transcript.  I'll skip over the witness's</P>\n","<P>16    name because I can't recall at present whether or not he was protected,</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Robinson.  I don't think he was, because I don't have any note to that</P>\n","<P>18    effect, but he says:  \"In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the</P>\n","<P>19    White Wolves, and the JNA participated.\"</P>\n","<P>20            Do you know anything about this?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,</P>\n","<P>22    there was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from</P>\n","<P>23    Eastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the</P>\n","<P>24    indictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.</P>\n","<P>25    His name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43721 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    helicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was</P>\n","<P> 2    accompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 3    Party, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for</P>\n","<P> 4    sure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also</P>\n","<P> 5    Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as</P>\n","<P> 6    the Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was</P>\n","<P> 7    charged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in</P>\n","<P> 8    Banja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 9    Party.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and</P>\n","<P>10    the party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don't know that Kragujevac</P>\n","<P>12    is not in Bosnia.</P>\n","<P>13       A.   That's correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I'm getting ready</P>\n","<P>14    to obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was</P>\n","<P>15    expelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan</P>\n","<P>16    Savic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the</P>\n","<P>17    Serb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave</P>\n","<P>18    my legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial</P>\n","<P>19    and all the accompanying materials.</P>\n","<P>20            As for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to</P>\n","<P>21    me certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man</P>\n","<P>22    Radovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his</P>\n","<P>23    participation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.</P>\n","<P>24            Those are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members</P>\n","<P>25    of the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43722 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    had previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even</P>\n","<P> 2    called him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was</P>\n","<P> 3    Srecko Radovanovic.</P>\n","<P> 4            There was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was</P>\n","<P> 5    certainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was</P>\n","<P> 6    certainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been</P>\n","<P> 7    he would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that</P>\n","<P> 8    unit was called the Grey Wolves.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I've understood</P>\n","<P>10    from that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions</P>\n","<P>11    in Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you've said?</P>\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,</P>\n","<P>13    yes.</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called</P>\n","<P>15    the Grey Wolves active there?</P>\n","<P>16            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it's very problematic to say</P>\n","<P>17    paramilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means</P>\n","<P>18    outside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial</P>\n","<P>19    Defence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I'm not</P>\n","<P>20    sure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,</P>\n","<P>21    I think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good</P>\n","<P>22    fighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what</P>\n","<P>23    happened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called</P>\n","<P>24    Crkvina or something like that.  I can't recall it all off the top of my</P>\n","<P>25    head, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43723 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Banja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven't dealt with.  Did</P>\n","<P> 3    they participate?</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What</P>\n","<P> 5    Red Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's a perfectly legitimate answer for you to</P>\n","<P> 7    give, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the</P>\n","<P> 8    Red Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the</P>\n","<P> 9    quotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,</P>\n","<P>10    which on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they've got</P>\n","<P>11    nothing to do with the question.  So all I'm doing now is trying to find</P>\n","<P>12    out what the real answer to that question is.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.</P>\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the</P>\n","<P>15    Red Berets.</P>\n","<P>16                          --- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.</P>\n","<P>17                          --- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the</P>\n","<P>19    technical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary</P>\n","<P>20    resulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected</P>\n","<P>21    witness.</P>\n","<P>22            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>23            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43724 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Wolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also</P>\n","<P> 2    mentioned.  Now, the witness, I don't know whether he was protected or</P>\n","<P> 3    not, I don't want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript says that he saw 20 locals, and it's about Samac, wearing</P>\n","<P> 5    uniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed</P>\n","<P> 6    they were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned</P>\n","<P> 7    to Samac.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, I don't have any information to that effect, and that is</P>\n","<P> 9    quite impossible.  I'd like to point out once again that in different</P>\n","<P>10    places they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had</P>\n","<P>11    found some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have</P>\n","<P>12    been various units, especially as we're talking about locals in this</P>\n","<P>13    particular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What</P>\n","<P>14    does it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some</P>\n","<P>15    warehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they</P>\n","<P>16    were some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the</P>\n","<P>17    Red Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of</P>\n","<P>18    the State Security in 1996.</P>\n","<P>19            So quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term</P>\n","<P>20    applies to different concepts.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I</P>\n","<P>22    think that is in the indictment against you but you'll put me right if I'm</P>\n","<P>23    wrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,</P>\n","<P>24    that is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,</P>\n","<P>25    wherein amongst others you said:  \"Dear brother Chetniks, especially you</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43725 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    across the Drina, you're the bravest, and we're going to clear up Bosnia</P>\n","<P> 2    from the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong.\"  Is</P>\n","<P> 3    it true that you said that?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and</P>\n","<P> 5    partially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,</P>\n","<P> 6    because -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don't always know</P>\n","<P> 7    the Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an</P>\n","<P> 8    artificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the</P>\n","<P> 9    Croats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian</P>\n","<P>10    variation \"pogan\" means \"pagan,\" where as in the Serb language \"pogan\"</P>\n","<P>11    means \"waste\" or \"faeces.\"  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and</P>\n","<P>12    pan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called</P>\n","<P>13    them \"pogani,\" which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the</P>\n","<P>14    Muslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I'm not a stupid</P>\n","<P>15    man.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have</P>\n","<P>16    nothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more</P>\n","<P>17    than I do to all the Christians afterwards, let's make that point clear,</P>\n","<P>18    but I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --</P>\n","<P>19    greatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims</P>\n","<P>20    to be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.</P>\n","<P>21            So here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion</P>\n","<P>22    is being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,</P>\n","<P>23    and I've been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,</P>\n","<P>24    Islamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they</P>\n","<P>25    first appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43726 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.  Well, if you</P>\n","<P> 4    haven't got if it in my books then the Prosecution probably has a copy</P>\n","<P> 5    because most of my speeches were published in my books, in my works so, if</P>\n","<P> 6    a speech does not happen to be there, if --</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  Was this one published in your books?

I can't look through that whole</P>\n","<P>14    matter myself, because I didn't make the statement only in one place.

Witness B1643 who testified pursuant to 92 bis, I assume you know</P>\n","<P>23    the written part, mentioned torture and capture of civilians in the SUP</P>\n","<P>24    building of the Territorial Defence in the primary school and secondary</P>\n","<P>25    school in Crkvina, the warehouse there.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43728 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, I already mentioned something about this.  I said that the</P>\n","<P> 2    Crkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey</P>\n","<P> 3    Wolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was</P>\n","<P> 4    arrested, but I don't have any details about how the trial proceeded and</P>\n","<P> 5    the upshot.  I asked my legal advisors to find the complete dossier of</P>\n","<P> 6    that trial, but I do know for certain that he was arrested and taken to</P>\n","<P> 7    trial in Banja Luka, prosecuted in Banja Luka.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   The indictment against you, in the indictment you are accused of</P>\n","<P> 9    an act on the 7th of May, 1992, which allegedly happened there which says</P>\n","<P>10    that two leaders of your group under your command killed 18 males at the</P>\n","<P>11    agricultural farm in Crkvina.  Is that the event you are referring to?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn't there</P>\n","<P>13    nor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical</P>\n","<P>14    Party.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   That's all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your</P>\n","<P>16    answer suffices.</P>\n","<P>17            You are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when</P>\n","<P>18    allegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated</P>\n","<P>19    killed 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating</P>\n","<P>21    on the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?</P>\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was</P>\n","<P>23    quoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>\n","<P>24    So it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this</P>\n","<P>25    question of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43729 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    concept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he</P>\n","<P> 2    stands accused, because he's testifying here.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily</P>\n","<P> 4    relevant for that purpose.</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I'm not going to</P>\n","<P> 6    insist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.</P>\n","<P> 7            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993</P>\n","<P> 9    some members of your alleged --</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have</P>\n","<P>11    continued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not</P>\n","<P>12    see at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial</P>\n","<P>13    here.  I know that he's alleged to be a member of the joint criminal</P>\n","<P>14    enterprise.  I'm well aware of that.  But that doesn't let in any and all</P>\n","<P>15    kind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.</P>\n","<P>16            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see</P>\n","<P>17    here that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,</P>\n","<P>18    then that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren't true</P>\n","<P>19    either, and he has refuted a number of witnesses' statements here that I</P>\n","<P>20    quoted.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know</P>\n","<P>22    you know that.</P>\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.</P>\n","<P>24            MR.

Do you</P>\n","<P> 3    know anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked</P>\n","<P> 4    to killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire</P>\n","<P> 6    in Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front</P>\n","<P> 7    line stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part</P>\n","<P> 8    under Muslim control and another part under Serb control.</P>\n","<P> 9            Now, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind</P>\n","<P>10    the following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from</P>\n","<P>11    rifles which wasn't a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because</P>\n","<P>12    sniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with</P>\n","<P>13    optic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the</P>\n","<P>14    Serb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to</P>\n","<P>15    come by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black</P>\n","<P>16    market.  I don't exclude the possibility of individual cases there being</P>\n","<P>17    the need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was</P>\n","<P>18    opened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain</P>\n","<P>19    control of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two</P>\n","<P>20    sides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn't</P>\n","<P>21    change for many years, and one or the other side would take control of</P>\n","<P>22    certain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.</P>\n","<P>23            On the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional</P>\n","<P>24    killing of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims</P>\n","<P>25    killed about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43732 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    in Kazani and so on.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the</P>\n","<P> 3    Sarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present</P>\n","<P> 4    on both sides.  Is that true?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in</P>\n","<P> 6    Sarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The</P>\n","<P> 7    real snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far</P>\n","<P> 8    more than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more</P>\n","<P> 9    sophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more</P>\n","<P>10    favourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I've forgotten the evidence which I</P>\n","<P>12    think there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How</P>\n","<P>13    much personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the</P>\n","<P>14    conflict there.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to</P>\n","<P>16    the Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that</P>\n","<P>17    is.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.</P>\n","<P>18    At Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and</P>\n","<P>19    I met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh</P>\n","<P>20    shipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my</P>\n","<P>21    colleagues from university and also people whom I'd been to school with,</P>\n","<P>22    Muslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire</P>\n","<P>24    going on?</P>\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43733 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    stay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some</P>\n","<P> 2    dangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you</P>\n","<P> 3    had to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but</P>\n","<P> 4    there were no more serious conflicts at that time.</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,</P>\n","<P> 8    referred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on</P>\n","<P> 9    page 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs</P>\n","<P>10    fired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in</P>\n","<P>11    Sarajevo?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open</P>\n","<P>13    fire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be</P>\n","<P>14    ascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused</P>\n","<P>15    protected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction</P>\n","<P>16    from the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo</P>\n","<P>17    they would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at</P>\n","<P>18    Serb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off</P>\n","<P>19    in the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,</P>\n","<P>20    then they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at</P>\n","<P>21    hospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,</P>\n","<P>22    who were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the</P>\n","<P>23    hospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw</P>\n","<P>24    quickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived</P>\n","<P>25    they didn't come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43734 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    fire in retaliation.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited</P>\n","<P> 3    Bijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --</P>\n","<P> 4    page 8258 of Alija Gusalic's -- 18258, and I link this up with your</P>\n","<P> 5    indictment and Alija Gusalic's testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina</P>\n","<P> 6    and members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to</P>\n","<P> 7    takeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite</P>\n","<P> 9    correct.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just</P>\n","<P>10    nonsense.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there</P>\n","<P>12    were Arkan's men and Seselj's men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything</P>\n","<P>13    about that?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb</P>\n","<P>15    Radical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I'm absolutely certain</P>\n","<P>16    of that.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   The same witness says on page 18260, \"Seselj's men had beards and</P>\n","<P>18    cockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to</P>\n","<P>19    distribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party.\"</P>\n","<P>20       A.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>21    Radical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly</P>\n","<P>22    clean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not</P>\n","<P>23    bring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot</P>\n","<P>24    be synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for</P>\n","<P>25    ideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43735 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    not a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier</P>\n","<P> 2    having a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not</P>\n","<P> 3    distribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role</P>\n","<P> 4    in these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.</P>\n","<P> 5            Members of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but</P>\n","<P> 6    exclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now</P>\n","<P> 8    I'm asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were</P>\n","<P> 9    not Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were</P>\n","<P>10    held at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you</P>\n","<P>11    know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   I don't know about those particular localities, but I've already</P>\n","<P>13    talked about Mauzer's and Arkan's conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for</P>\n","<P>14    that reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often</P>\n","<P>15    attacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   I'm sorry that I didn't draw your attention to this on time,</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you</P>\n","<P>18    are being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in</P>\n","<P>19    Batkovic.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I've already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>21    Radical Party there.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.</P>\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic</P>\n","<P>24    testified here, and he made those assertions here, and I'm linking that up</P>\n","<P>25    with --</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43736 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness</P>\n","<P> 2    made the allegations here.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp</P>\n","<P> 4    near Bijeljina.  And I've linked that up to what the indictment against</P>\n","<P> 5    Mr. Seselj says.</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that's not relevant.  Move on.</P>\n","<P> 7            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused</P>\n","<P> 9    Mr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a</P>\n","<P>10    hundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?</P>\n","<P>11            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it's not relevant to</P>\n","<P>13    this case.</P>\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the</P>\n","<P>15    basis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks</P>\n","<P>16    about Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj's indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane</P>\n","<P>18    treatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's indictment?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the</P>\n","<P>23    International Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything</P>\n","<P>24    about this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   I don't know anything about the visit of the International Red</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43737 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Cross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.</P>\n","<P> 2    Also, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of</P>\n","<P> 3    prisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not</P>\n","<P> 4    take part in any such thing.</P>\n","<P> 5            As for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and</P>\n","<P> 6    if there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would</P>\n","<P> 7    have to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right.  I'm not going to ask you about this anymore.  You</P>\n","<P> 9    mentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is</P>\n","<P>10    that right?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the</P>\n","<P>13    activity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the</P>\n","<P>14    situation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,</P>\n","<P>15    do you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no</P>\n","<P>17    paramilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in</P>\n","<P>18    Mostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,</P>\n","<P>19    from the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>20    Party were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them</P>\n","<P>21    as highly disciplined on Belgrade television.</P>\n","<P>22            If there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have</P>\n","<P>23    been members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention</P>\n","<P>24    platoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not</P>\n","<P>25    preclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43738 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    was not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp</P>\n","<P> 3    there were Seselj's Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   That is absolutely impossible.  I've never heard of the White</P>\n","<P> 6    Eagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven't heard of this Buna</P>\n","<P> 7    camp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 8    Party, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared</P>\n","<P> 9    in Buna.  I don't know anything about this, but there should be proper</P>\n","<P>10    records to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White</P>\n","<P>11    Eagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any</P>\n","<P>12    Red Berets.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in</P>\n","<P>14    Nevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I</P>\n","<P>16    was in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and</P>\n","<P>17    in the Neretva valley.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in</P>\n","<P>20    Nevesinje.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   That will do.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable</P>\n","<P>23    number of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no</P>\n","<P>24    conflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large</P>\n","<P>25    number of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43739 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    were put up at various facilities there.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Do you know anything about a lake, Boracko Jezero, and a rest</P>\n","<P> 3    house there where about 19 persons were killed, according to the</P>\n","<P> 4    allegations made?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers</P>\n","<P> 6    of the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That's close to</P>\n","<P> 7    Konjic.  I've already said that there were members of the Serb guard</P>\n","<P> 8    there.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was</P>\n","<P> 9    there, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was</P>\n","<P>10    operating.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan's Serb</P>\n","<P>12    volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared</P>\n","<P>16    elsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities</P>\n","<P>17    had a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because</P>\n","<P>18    they stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then</P>\n","<P>19    they appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a</P>\n","<P>20    lot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic's.  As far as I</P>\n","<P>21    know, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>\n","<P>23       A.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav</P>\n","<P>24    Lajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43740 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   The Serb guard.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Of Vuk Draskovic?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from</P>\n","<P> 4    Novi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made</P>\n","<P> 6    to the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.  I've forgotten</P>\n","<P> 7    his first name.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Jovan.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Jovan Dulovic who testified here.  Mr. Robinson instructed me to</P>\n","<P>10    find the original documents that can be linked up to your submissions</P>\n","<P>11    since they refused to admit your submissions.</P>\n","<P>12            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I am sorry, Mr. Robinson.  If you're</P>\n","<P>13    telling me to have copies made I will do that, but I've just received</P>\n","<P>14    these copies.  This is a series of photocopies of articles written by</P>\n","<P>15    Jovan Dulovic and published in Ekspres Politika from the 16th of November,</P>\n","<P>16    the 26th of November, all of that in 1991.  Then the 18th of November, the</P>\n","<P>17    2nd of November.  So from November 1991.</P>\n","<P>18            In these articles, he speaks very favourably of the JNA and</P>\n","<P>19    commends their behaviour in the fighting around Vukovar.  For example, he</P>\n","<P>20    says that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats, saw the light of</P>\n","<P>21    the day after having stayed in cellars for many --</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, what is the question?</P>\n","<P>23            MR. NICE:  And, Your Honour, if I may interrupt, if there's going</P>\n","<P>24    to be a reference to and quotation from a newspaper article, it has to be</P>\n","<P>25    on the overhead projector.

MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, since I have only one copy of these articles and I've</P>\n","<P> 6    just received that, could the usher please place them on the ELMO, and</P>\n","<P> 7    then you can have a look at least at some of the parts that have been</P>\n","<P> 8    marked.  Reference is made to Major Sljivancanin here, too, in a very</P>\n","<P> 9    favourable light.  Gratitude for assistance to civilians, Croats, at that,</P>\n","<P>10    and so on and so forth.  Please look at this series of articles.</P>\n","<P>11            In order to answer my question, are these at least partly articles</P>\n","<P>12    that you relied on when you wrote those submissions to the other side</P>\n","<P>13    about the untruthful testimony of Jovan Dulovic or, rather, the difference</P>\n","<P>14    in -- between his reporting then and his testimony here about Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>15            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, that was a leading but nevertheless it's</P>\n","<P>16    interesting to see what the articles actually say.  And if it becomes</P>\n","<P>17    relevant to consider their admissibility as evidence, I know the Chamber</P>\n","<P>18    will have in mind its open recent ruling in respect of the documents of</P>\n","<P>19    Jasovic and the potential evidential value or not as evidence of these</P>\n","<P>20    documents, but I'm most interested frankly in seeing what they actually</P>\n","<P>21    say.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let's get it on the overhead projector.</P>\n","<P>23            There appears to be a technical problem.

We'll come back to this.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am sorry, but my</P>\n","<P> 3    next question also has to do with something that Mr. Seselj already</P>\n","<P> 4    testified about and the document that I obtained in the meantime and that</P>\n","<P> 5    would also have to be placed on the ELMO.  That is --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,</P>\n","<P> 7    because the overhead projector is not working.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further</P>\n","<P> 9    questions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except</P>\n","<P>10    for this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a</P>\n","<P>11    decision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were</P>\n","<P>12    presented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal</P>\n","<P>13    government said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was</P>\n","<P>14    known who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.</P>\n","<P>15    The 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.  So it is about</P>\n","<P>16    40 days after the coup d'etat of the 5th of October, 2000.  It was then</P>\n","<P>17    that they were all released, set free.</P>\n","<P>18            So wanted to show you this document, and I wanted to hand out</P>\n","<P>19    copies to you.  I've just received this.  They are all in the Serbian</P>\n","<P>20    language but they can be placed on the ELMO to show what the government</P>\n","<P>21    spokesman had said was completely disregarded, and these persons mentioned</P>\n","<P>22    in the criminal report against Erdemovic were set free.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The ELMO is working now, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please take a look at this.  This is a series of</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43744 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    articles from Ekspres Politika.  Can you see the date of the newspaper?</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of</P>\n","<P> 3    November.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   1991; right?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   1991.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Unless this is a leading question.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   It's illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one</P>\n","<P> 8    of the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when</P>\n","<P> 9    preparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.</P>\n","<P>10    That is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of</P>\n","<P>11    Evidence and Procedure.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the</P>\n","<P>13    subheading?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both</P>\n","<P>15    Serbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars</P>\n","<P>16    for a long time.  \"Light finally,\" is the heading.  And then in the</P>\n","<P>17    subheading:  \"Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas.\"  And then there's</P>\n","<P>18    another bit saying, \"In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,\"</P>\n","<P>19    and then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, \"I cannot believe</P>\n","<P>20    that we are alive,\" and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated</P>\n","<P>21    the town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.</P>\n","<P>22            THE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of</P>\n","<P>23    the question was not heard by the interpreters.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.  The interpreters have</P>\n","<P>25    indicated that you're overlapping and so she did not hear the beginning of</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43745 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    the last question.  Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P> 2            And please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.</P>\n","<P> 5    Perhaps it's easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text</P>\n","<P> 6    is.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as</P>\n","<P> 8    follows:  \"A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total</P>\n","<P> 9    of 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity.\"</P>\n","<P>10    That's what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and</P>\n","<P>11    Croats equally.  Civilians, that is.</P>\n","<P>12            I can't read the first paragraph because it's quite illegible, but</P>\n","<P>13    it seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,</P>\n","<P>14    that several ambulances were waiting to help.  \"It would not be a good</P>\n","<P>15    thing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now.\"</P>\n","<P>16            So Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of</P>\n","<P>17    Vukovar before the fighting had stopped.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Can you see the subtitle which says \"The cruel major\"?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this</P>\n","<P>21    refers to and what it says about this cruel major.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians</P>\n","<P>23    very nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that</P>\n","<P>24    surprised this Croat woman, and he says:  \"No knows what she as a Croat</P>\n","<P>25    heard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers.\"  So he's describing the</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43746 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    behaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what</P>\n","<P> 2    Croatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very</P>\n","<P> 3    bad way.</P>\n","<P> 4            And then Major Sljivancanin says:  \"Whenever you need anything,</P>\n","<P> 5    look for me and I'll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to</P>\n","<P> 6    go, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full</P>\n","<P> 7    of gratitude.\"  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  \"He had</P>\n","<P> 8    followed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude.\"</P>\n","<P> 9            All this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now</P>\n","<P>10    Colonel Veselin Sljivancanin.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic</P>\n","<P>12    describes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, \"Take this</P>\n","<P>13    child to hospital immediately.\"</P>\n","<P>14       A.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, \"Take this child to the</P>\n","<P>15    hospital in Negoslavci right away,\" Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing</P>\n","<P>16    the ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  \"Let her be given</P>\n","<P>17    assistance and medicine.\"</P>\n","<P>18            A little later Vlatka's mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for</P>\n","<P>19    her daughter in the crowd.  \"Where is my child?

The</P>\n","<P>22    frightened woman didn't believe it.\"  This is followed by Dulovic's</P>\n","<P>23    comment:  \"Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA</P>\n","<P>24    soldiers.\"</P>\n","<P>25       Q.

In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and</P>\n","<P> 4    dressed Vlatka's wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the</P>\n","<P> 5    daughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them.\"</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   So this is Dulovic's report from the Vukovar war theatre.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on</P>\n","<P> 9    the following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points</P>\n","<P>10    are.  This large title, this heading, that is.</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.  Now it's been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a</P>\n","<P>12    statement, \"I believed in the army.\"  And what's in the subtitle.  \"A</P>\n","<P>13    little less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in</P>\n","<P>14    Vukovar.\"  And then there's a quotation.</P>\n","<P>15       A.   \"We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the</P>\n","<P>16    guards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the</P>\n","<P>17    hospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims.\"</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   And look what it says in the article.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the</P>\n","<P>20    following:  \"In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and</P>\n","<P>21    barricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house</P>\n","<P>22    number 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,</P>\n","<P>23    Milos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.

Milka Vidovic said, 'When they visited us in the</P>\n","<P> 8    cellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone's throats.  We</P>\n","<P> 9    Serbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the</P>\n","<P>10    only thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.

The same Jovan Dulovic who four or five years</P>\n","<P>17    later changed his version by -- he turned around by 180 degrees because he</P>\n","<P>18    has become a mercenary of the Western intelligence services, and he writes</P>\n","<P>19    for the magazine Vreme which is the Belgrade branch of Western</P>\n","<P>20    intelligence agencies.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   Mr. Seselj, when you glanced through this article and you dealt</P>\n","<P>22    with it in your submission, is there a single word here which does not</P>\n","<P>23    speak favourably of the JNA and the people who fought in Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   No.  The texts are all exceptionally favourable, full of praise</P>\n","<P>25    for the soldiers and officers of the JNA during the fighting for Vukovar.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43749 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.

Well, move on.  Move on.</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Mr. Milosevic, Dulovic says here one day with volunteers and tank</P>\n","<P> 6    crews in the street fighting for the liberation of Vukovar.  He praises</P>\n","<P> 7    the volunteers who participated in the fighting for Vukovar as part of the</P>\n","<P> 8    JNA.  So this should be noted.</P>\n","<P> 9            Next page, please.  I think that it's very important to point this</P>\n","<P>10    out.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   And the signature is Jovan Dulovic.  What's the title of this</P>\n","<P>12    article?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   The title of this article is \"The Knights of Vukovar.\"</P>\n","<P>14       Q.

The units of Major Borivoje Tesic on the front line in Vukovar.</P>\n","<P>16    Major Borivoje Tesic I think -- says: \"I think this is the last stage of</P>\n","<P>17    the fighting.

Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic</P>\n","<P>22    said volunteers as part of JNA.

Can it be enlarged?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   \"With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making</P>\n","<P> 9    openings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze</P>\n","<P>10    through and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.

Or was it your</P>\n","<P>16    comment?</P>\n","<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  Please.  In the entire text the</P>\n","<P>18    volunteers are spoken of as members of the JNA.

The following text or this one</P>\n","<P>19    again says the Knights of Vukovar, Major Borivoje Tesic's units on the</P>\n","<P>20    front line, and this is a large article which seems not to be by Dulovic,</P>\n","<P>21    but on the left-hand side there is a small one:  \"Brave commander falls,</P>\n","<P>22    Borovo Selo.\"  Would you look at the signature?  I believe it's by</P>\n","<P>23    Dulovic.  Could you scroll up?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   What does it say in the passage marked by yellow?</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43752 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   The initials \"JD\" mean Jovan Dulovic.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   And what does it say in this last passage?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- \"The inhabitants of the</P>\n","<P> 4    Crepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,</P>\n","<P> 5    who with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village</P>\n","<P> 6    and one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the</P>\n","<P> 7    highest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages.\"</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   And he was killed?</P>\n","<P> 9       A.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives</P>\n","<P>10    him.  Next page.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a</P>\n","<P>12    look?  I haven't had time to look at it all carefully.</P>\n","<P>13       A.   Yes.  There's a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of</P>\n","<P>14    November.  \"Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate</P>\n","<P>15    Vukovar.\"</P>\n","<P>16            In these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate</P>\n","<P>17    Vukovar, and five years later he's saying something completely different.</P>\n","<P>18             \"Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in</P>\n","<P>19    Vukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb.\"  And then it</P>\n","<P>20    says:  \"The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back,\" and so on</P>\n","<P>21    and so forth.</P>\n","<P>22            So this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the</P>\n","<P>23    JNA.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It's been circled.</P>\n","<P>25       A.   Yes.</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43753 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   Very well.</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   The 4th of November, 1991.  \"For two days fierce fighting has not</P>\n","<P> 3    stopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in</P>\n","<P> 4    flames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of</P>\n","<P> 5    Njusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the</P>\n","<P> 6    Territorial Defence.  Advances by Territorial Defence units and volunteers</P>\n","<P> 7    from the direction of Trpinja stopped on the edge of Borovo Naselje.\"</P>\n","<P> 8            He then speaks of a Croatian mortar attack on Bobota [phoen] and</P>\n","<P> 9    so on.</P>\n","<P>10       Q.   Is this another report by Dulovic?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes, it's signed by Jovan Dulovic.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Is there anything else, any other report?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   I'm looking at another text here but I can't see whether it's by</P>\n","<P>14    Dulovic or not because it's not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian</P>\n","<P>15    volunteer guard but again a very favourable text.  I couldn't see -- I</P>\n","<P>16    can't see the name of the author here.  I can't see it on this page.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Is there anything else underneath, another report?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   \"Who are the volunteers,\" is the next title.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Well, I can't see anything anymore.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced</P>\n","<P>21    through the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is \"Through the holes</P>\n","<P>22    to the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>23    Unknown ammunition with inhumane bullets.\"</P>\n","<P>24            What happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used</P>\n","<P>25    weapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43754 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    because the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal</P>\n","<P> 2    organs.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I can't see what it says here in yellow, highlighted</P>\n","<P> 4    in yellow.</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It's Major Radic now</P>\n","<P> 6    who also stands accused in The Hague.  \"Throughout the month of October,</P>\n","<P> 7    the fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in</P>\n","<P> 8    the clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least</P>\n","<P> 9    one person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja</P>\n","<P>10    [phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in</P>\n","<P>11    that way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had</P>\n","<P>12    taken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.</P>\n","<P>13    The snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own</P>\n","<P>14    control and then a solution was found to move through the houses.\"</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic's article</P>\n","<P>16    again?</P>\n","<P>17       A.   Well, it's not legible but it is a series of articles by him.  We</P>\n","<P>18    can't find a signature here but quite obviously it is a series of articles</P>\n","<P>19    by him.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  Is that a series of articles to which you</P>\n","<P>21    referred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect</P>\n","<P>22    to Dulovic's testimony?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   Yes.  But this isn't the complete material.  My legal advisors</P>\n","<P>24    found many more texts of this kind and they quote them in extenso, and in</P>\n","<P>25    my submission I state my intention to disclose them in keeping with</P>\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B>  </B></P></CENTER>\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43755 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Rule 67 of the rules of evidence.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, I have one more question</P>\n","<P> 3    [as interpreted] -- Robinson, I have a question for you.

NICE:  Rather interesting issues, I think, arise on the</P>\n","<P>10    validity of these documents as exhibits, and it may be necessary to go</P>\n","<P>11    back and remind ourselves of what Mr. Dulovic himself said about these</P>\n","<P>12    matters.  So I would respectfully invite the Chamber to put that matter</P>\n","<P>13    back.  But may we see the -- may we have access to this material tonight</P>\n","<P>14    in copy form in any event?  It may be we have them elsewhere, but it will</P>\n","<P>15    be a difficult task to find them and it may in any event not be an</P>\n","<P>16    identical collection.

[Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some</P>\n","<P>22    questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian</P>\n","<P>23    indictment, that have to do with the \"Rump Presidency\" as it's called</P>\n","<P>24    here.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  \"The Rump Presidency</P>\n","<P>25    carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies,\" and so on and so forth, \"had</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43649 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    effect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief.\"</P>\n","<P> 2            I'm not going to ask you to repeat what you've already said, but</P>\n","<P> 3    in relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of</P>\n","<P> 4    Serbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they</P>\n","<P> 5    not take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency</P>\n","<P> 6    of the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any</P>\n","<P> 7    objective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from</P>\n","<P> 8    carrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?</P>\n","<P> 9            The question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,</P>\n","<P>10    Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the</P>\n","<P>11    SFRY Presidency in Belgrade?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,</P>\n","<P>13    staying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was</P>\n","<P>14    never a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from</P>\n","<P>15    carrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped</P>\n","<P>16    coming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had</P>\n","<P>17    practically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe</P>\n","<P>18    Mesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying</P>\n","<P>19    that they could not come because they could not strike a balance in</P>\n","<P>20    relation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and</P>\n","<P>21    Montenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.</P>\n","<P>22            The representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were</P>\n","<P>23    not expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was</P>\n","<P>24    actually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display</P>\n","<P>25    such feelings at the time.  It's only when he left Belgrade and when he</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43650 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    came back to the Croatian parliament that he said, \"I've completed my</P>\n","<P> 2    duty.  Yugoslavia is no more.\"</P>\n","<P> 3            He pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.</P>\n","<P> 4    Also, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him</P>\n","<P> 5    sufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he</P>\n","<P> 6    condemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most</P>\n","<P> 7    cooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was</P>\n","<P> 8    what he was.</P>\n","<P> 9            I already said that according to the constitution of the then</P>\n","<P>10    Yugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one</P>\n","<P>11    single member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been</P>\n","<P>12    prevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could</P>\n","<P>13    have gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could</P>\n","<P>14    have refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the</P>\n","<P>15    Presidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the</P>\n","<P>16    Presidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed</P>\n","<P>17    within the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably</P>\n","<P>18    before Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a</P>\n","<P>19    Rump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of</P>\n","<P>20    a rump Presidency.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  \"Slobodan Milosevic,</P>\n","<P>24    in his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that</P>\n","<P>25    Yugoslavia was finished.\"</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43651 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            Please, you've got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I'm not</P>\n","<P> 2    going to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much</P>\n","<P> 3    time.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to</P>\n","<P> 4    here or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that</P>\n","<P> 5    Yugoslavia was finished?</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say</P>\n","<P> 7    that Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you</P>\n","<P> 8    never said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I</P>\n","<P> 9    remember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the</P>\n","<P>10    behaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went</P>\n","<P>11    through a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,</P>\n","<P>12    constitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,</P>\n","<P>13    but then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional</P>\n","<P>14    provision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases</P>\n","<P>15    to exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the</P>\n","<P>16    matter.</P>\n","<P>17            The leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never</P>\n","<P>18    did it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and</P>\n","<P>19    Croatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and</P>\n","<P>20    Macedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro</P>\n","<P>21    proclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting</P>\n","<P>22    of two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration</P>\n","<P>23    on your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43652 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   \"In March 1991 the collective Presidency of the SFRY reached a</P>\n","<P> 2    deadlock on several issues.\"  That is paragraph 56.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... that sentence</P>\n","<P> 4    which is at the beginning of the paragraph.  There's another allegation in</P>\n","<P> 5    that last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no</P>\n","<P> 6    longer be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask</P>\n","<P> 7    Mr. Seselj whether that is so.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember</P>\n","<P> 9    at that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian</P>\n","<P>10    public, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the</P>\n","<P>11    decisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that</P>\n","<P>12    Serbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation</P>\n","<P>13    when the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.</P>\n","<P>14            I would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there</P>\n","<P>15    was a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the</P>\n","<P>16    headquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long</P>\n","<P>17    debate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the</P>\n","<P>18    demand of the military to declare a state of emergency.</P>\n","<P>19            The top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the</P>\n","<P>20    behaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a</P>\n","<P>21    vote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.  As far as I can</P>\n","<P>22    remember --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You have answered the question I asked, thanks.</P>\n","<P>24            Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43653 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   That is what is referred to here.  It says the representatives on</P>\n","<P> 2    the Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,</P>\n","<P> 3    the autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of</P>\n","<P> 4    Kosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what</P>\n","<P> 5    was so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the</P>\n","<P> 6    Presidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also</P>\n","<P> 8    start the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven't got the document here</P>\n","<P> 9    so I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were</P>\n","<P>10    actually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already</P>\n","<P>11    started putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the</P>\n","<P>12    Presidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the</P>\n","<P>13    Presidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not</P>\n","<P>14    very constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the</P>\n","<P>15    Presidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,</P>\n","<P>16    or Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.</P>\n","<P>17    I think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been</P>\n","<P>18    recalled in the meantime.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that</P>\n","<P>20    session or before that session or in relation to that session I never</P>\n","<P>21    declared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did</P>\n","<P>22    they declare that Yugoslavia was finished?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   I've already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian</P>\n","<P>24    politicians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was</P>\n","<P>25    one of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43654 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    hard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.</P>\n","<P> 2            As for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in</P>\n","<P> 3    Montenegro either.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to</P>\n","<P> 5    normal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic</P>\n","<P> 6    was elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented</P>\n","<P> 7    Vojvodina at the time.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the</P>\n","<P> 9    Presidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started</P>\n","<P>10    working again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its</P>\n","<P>11    work.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of</P>\n","<P>12    Bosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil</P>\n","<P>13    Tupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new</P>\n","<P>14    crisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be</P>\n","<P>15    elected president of the Presidency.</P>\n","<P>16            There was a principle involved that the president of the</P>\n","<P>17    Presidency was elected from a different republican province every year but</P>\n","<P>18    nobody's election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic</P>\n","<P>19    did not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European</P>\n","<P>20    envoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to</P>\n","<P>21    elect him nevertheless.</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting</P>\n","<P>24    the preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from</P>\n","<P>25    those positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43655 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says</P>\n","<P> 2    that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and</P>\n","<P> 3    discussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between</P>\n","<P> 4    Serbia and Croatia?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I</P>\n","<P> 6    remember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what</P>\n","<P> 7    was skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching</P>\n","<P> 8    agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the</P>\n","<P> 9    Bosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a</P>\n","<P>10    situation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it</P>\n","<P>11    increasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the</P>\n","<P>12    country at the time.</P>\n","<P>13            At that time, I -- as I've already said, the presidents of the</P>\n","<P>14    presidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys</P>\n","<P>15    had actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach</P>\n","<P>16    agreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia</P>\n","<P>17    increasingly so.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through</P>\n","<P>19    what medium?</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully</P>\n","<P>21    being bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media</P>\n","<P>22    this kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were</P>\n","<P>23    already at that time being financed from the West by different Western</P>\n","<P>24    intelligence agencies, so that's the kind of media I'm talking about.  In</P>\n","<P>25    Belgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43656 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    federal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic</P>\n","<P> 2    government, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government</P>\n","<P> 3    in Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the</P>\n","<P> 4    Western powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante</P>\n","<P> 5    Markovic's government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible</P>\n","<P> 6    agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 7    together under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been</P>\n","<P> 8    eliminated.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at</P>\n","<P>12    one stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence</P>\n","<P>13    counsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest</P>\n","<P>14    collaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This</P>\n","<P>15    denies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of</P>\n","<P>16    Bosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted</P>\n","<P>17    into evidence and if not we will find this transcript.</P>\n","<P>18            However, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with</P>\n","<P>19    you as you were an active participant in all political events.  This</P>\n","<P>20    meeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the</P>\n","<P>21    division of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any</P>\n","<P>22    member of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning</P>\n","<P>23    of which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way</P>\n","<P>24    even indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43657 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    if Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 2    as an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as</P>\n","<P> 3    a constituent nation as they had been before in the previous</P>\n","<P> 4    constitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the</P>\n","<P> 5    first president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it</P>\n","<P> 6    was not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint</P>\n","<P> 7    state.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans</P>\n","<P> 8    persuaded him to call off the agreement.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It</P>\n","<P>10    says:  \"On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY</P>\n","<P>11    Presidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,</P>\n","<P>12    Sejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY</P>\n","<P>13    Presidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the</P>\n","<P>14    Presidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and</P>\n","<P>15    Macedonia.\"</P>\n","<P>16            On the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.

There was absolutely no takeover.  When four of the members of the</P>\n","<P>20    Presidency withdrew and some of them officially gave notice that they were</P>\n","<P>21    no longer members, like Drnovsek, for instance, while others simply</P>\n","<P>22    stopped attending the sessions.

In paragraph 65 it says:  \"On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,</P>\n","<P> 7    Slobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal</P>\n","<P> 8    enterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from</P>\n","<P> 9    Belgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the</P>\n","<P>10    mobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay</P>\n","<P>11    in Yugoslavia.\"</P>\n","<P>12            First of all, let's establish when I began advocating a unitary</P>\n","<P>13    Serb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And</P>\n","<P>14    secondly, was this anyone's idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,</P>\n","<P>15    and is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever</P>\n","<P>16    been a unitary state?</P>\n","<P>17       A.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as</P>\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally</P>\n","<P>19    and your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt</P>\n","<P>20    the new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the</P>\n","<P>21    autonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the</P>\n","<P>22    Serb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of</P>\n","<P>23    autonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an</P>\n","<P>24    option.</P>\n","<P>25            Furthermore, when the four former federal units had already been</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43660 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    recognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the</P>\n","<P> 2    Montenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be</P>\n","<P> 3    promulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump</P>\n","<P> 4    Yugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would</P>\n","<P> 5    have been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -</P>\n","<P> 6    because that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary</P>\n","<P> 7    Serbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this</P>\n","<P> 8    but didn't want to, and I am sorry that you didn't do that, because up to</P>\n","<P> 9    the point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --</P>\n","<P>10    in Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It</P>\n","<P>11    appeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any</P>\n","<P>13    of my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who</P>\n","<P>14    were allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had</P>\n","<P>15    any kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated</P>\n","<P>17    with you advocated such an idea.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it</P>\n","<P>19    says here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of</P>\n","<P>20    reservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the</P>\n","<P>21    reasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was</P>\n","<P>22    called for?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   I'm not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation</P>\n","<P>24    of reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to</P>\n","<P>25    mobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43661 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    to take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the</P>\n","<P> 2    territorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that</P>\n","<P> 3    this mobilisation didn't go well.  The response was very poor, because</P>\n","<P> 4    Veljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn't want to remove the</P>\n","<P> 5    communist insignia from the military uniforms.</P>\n","<P> 6            The Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the</P>\n","<P> 7    Presidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was</P>\n","<P> 8    Prime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in</P>\n","<P> 9    Slovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of</P>\n","<P>10    such an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops</P>\n","<P>11    into Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then</P>\n","<P>12    leadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as</P>\n","<P>13    I know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership</P>\n","<P>14    which had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your</P>\n","<P>16    name, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask</P>\n","<P>17    you now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of</P>\n","<P>18    April, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan's and</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you</P>\n","<P>20    know anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and</P>\n","<P>21    cart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of</P>\n","<P>22    cooperation with Arkan's volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>24    did not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert</P>\n","<P>25    that, I'm saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43662 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    organised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as</P>\n","<P> 2    much as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.</P>\n","<P> 3    That's a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P> 4    Radical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty</P>\n","<P> 5    to Serbia.  I guarantee that.</P>\n","<P> 6            The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict</P>\n","<P> 7    instructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb</P>\n","<P> 8    volunteer guard up to the --</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm asking why was that instruction given to the</P>\n","<P>10    volunteers of the Serb Radical Party?</P>\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.</P>\n","<P>12    We didn't want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn't</P>\n","<P>13    want people's awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.</P>\n","<P>14            As I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,</P>\n","<P>15    long before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had</P>\n","<P>16    quarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was</P>\n","<P>17    in danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this</P>\n","<P>18    in the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding</P>\n","<P>20    that instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with</P>\n","<P>21    Arkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You're</P>\n","<P>22    not there with them.</P>\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can't say that not a single</P>\n","<P>24    volunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There's one</P>\n","<P>25    instance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43663 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    teacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 2    Party.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of</P>\n","<P> 3    about 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back</P>\n","<P> 4    but, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of</P>\n","<P> 5    Arkan's men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.</P>\n","<P> 6            So, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint</P>\n","<P> 7    military activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with</P>\n","<P> 8    Arkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a</P>\n","<P> 9    distance from Arkan.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.</P>\n","<P>11            Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on</P>\n","<P>14    transcript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia</P>\n","<P>15    took place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj's</P>\n","<P>16    White Eagles.</P>\n","<P>17            First of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and</P>\n","<P>18    secondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj's White Eagles?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb</P>\n","<P>20    people organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have</P>\n","<P>21    already said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of</P>\n","<P>22    volunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After</P>\n","<P>23    that, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we</P>\n","<P>24    had volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never</P>\n","<P>25    had anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43664 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            There was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo</P>\n","<P> 2    Selo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he</P>\n","<P> 3    was killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not</P>\n","<P> 4    carrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no</P>\n","<P> 5    joint military activities.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Let's clarify this.  It doesn't say here that you cooperated.  It</P>\n","<P> 7    says here:  \"With infiltration of Seselj's White Eagles.\"  So the White</P>\n","<P> 8    Eagles are being ascribed to you.</P>\n","<P> 9       A.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the</P>\n","<P>10    Prosecutor bringing witnesses here who don't no anything about what</P>\n","<P>11    happened on the ground.  It's simply nonsense to talk of a group called</P>\n","<P>12    Seselj's White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and</P>\n","<P>13    the Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn't know</P>\n","<P>14    what he was talking about.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,</P>\n","<P>16    2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that \"Seselj collected men in</P>\n","<P>17    Erdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia.\"  Is that</P>\n","<P>18    true, Mr. Seselj?</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493</P>\n","<P>20    who testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake</P>\n","<P>22    in my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that</P>\n","<P>23    particular page, and the page is 19003.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43665 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    them to Bosnia?</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in</P>\n","<P> 3    Erdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,</P>\n","<P> 4    nicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only</P>\n","<P> 5    time.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --</P>\n","<P> 6    we never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there</P>\n","<P> 7    either, and I can state that quite categorically.</P>\n","<P> 8            The people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the</P>\n","<P> 9    war and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were</P>\n","<P>10    exclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I</P>\n","<P>11    absolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan's centre in Erdut</P>\n","<P>12    later on.  We never had anything to do with it.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is</P>\n","<P>14    20294, says that Arkan's and Seselj's men shot above the heads of the</P>\n","<P>15    civilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in</P>\n","<P>16    Bratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who</P>\n","<P>17    mistreated and abused the civilians?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian</P>\n","<P>19    Radical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my</P>\n","<P>20    knowledge Arkan didn't appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in</P>\n","<P>21    Zvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in</P>\n","<P>22    Bratunac either.  And I've already said that in Bratunac there was</P>\n","<P>23    Deronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there</P>\n","<P>24    I was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have</P>\n","<P>25    very certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43666 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj's men were</P>\n","<P> 2    in Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 3    mean there is no difference, says he.</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can't see any</P>\n","<P> 5    difference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the</P>\n","<P> 6    White Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at</P>\n","<P> 7    all.  And that's not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some</P>\n","<P> 8    judgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to</P>\n","<P> 9    see in some other places Seselj's White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the</P>\n","<P>10    problem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses</P>\n","<P>11    which it manipulates.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on</P>\n","<P>13    several occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --</P>\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven't been able to check this myself</P>\n","<P>15    because the accused hasn't been getting the references correct, and it's</P>\n","<P>16    quite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I'm grateful to</P>\n","<P>17    Ms. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came</P>\n","<P>18    (redacted).</P>\n","<P>19    But, really, I'm afraid we've got to have correct references for the</P>\n","<P>20    witnesses.  We can't simply just go to the page in the transcript.</P>\n","<P>21    Frequently our page numbers don't necessarily coincide here in court, and</P>\n","<P>22    without reference to the witnesses it's very difficult to pick it up</P>\n","<P>23    later.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in</P>\n","<P>25    pinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you're referring.  Now,</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43667 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Judge Kwon has already corrected you once, and apparently there is another</P>\n","<P> 2    mistake in the reference.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, perhaps there might be a</P>\n","<P> 4    mistake with the name, but there is no mistake with the quotation from the</P>\n","<P> 5    transcript, and my question relates to the material facts which are being</P>\n","<P> 6    mentioned here.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, we have to follow it, Mr. Milosevic.  There</P>\n","<P> 8    is duty on you to be more careful.</P>\n","<P> 9            Please proceed.</P>\n","<P>10            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. Robinson.  And I'll</P>\n","<P>11    check this out to see whether indeed it is the same witness from</P>\n","<P>12    page 20352, the transcript line and page, the quotation that I mentioned</P>\n","<P>13    earlier on or, rather, 20351 is the exact number.  I'll check that out</P>\n","<P>14    during the break.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript</P>\n","<P>17    said that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of</P>\n","<P>18    March, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan's men took part as well as</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the</P>\n","<P>20    occupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on</P>\n","<P>21    the 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of</P>\n","<P>22    your volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What</P>\n","<P>24    happened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between</P>\n","<P>25    the JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43668 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Muslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.</P>\n","<P> 2    However, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went</P>\n","<P> 3    on for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting</P>\n","<P> 4    the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was</P>\n","<P> 5    there, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my</P>\n","<P> 6    knowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of</P>\n","<P> 7    the local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to</P>\n","<P> 8    establish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the</P>\n","<P> 9    ground there.</P>\n","<P>10            I know -- have reliable information that the commands and the</P>\n","<P>11    officers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan's and</P>\n","<P>12    the Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a</P>\n","<P>13    great deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very</P>\n","<P>14    rarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.</P>\n","<P>15            As far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,</P>\n","<P>16    over there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did</P>\n","<P>17    appear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the</P>\n","<P>18    call of Biljana Plavsic.  I can't prove that, but I do know that Biljana</P>\n","<P>19    Plavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly</P>\n","<P>20    meeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The</P>\n","<P>21    volunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina</P>\n","<P>22    were not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the</P>\n","<P>23    Serbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were</P>\n","<P>24    residents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the</P>\n","<P>25    conflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43669 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    and Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan's right-hand man.  And in</P>\n","<P> 2    Serbia we didn't send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something</P>\n","<P> 4    for me in relation to the Prosecution's case.  In the Bosnia indictment</P>\n","<P> 5    the allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other</P>\n","<P> 6    members of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the</P>\n","<P> 7    Prosecution case unfolded, you're not saying, are you, that he acted</P>\n","<P> 8    alone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with</P>\n","<P> 9    other members of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven't reviewed each and every allegation</P>\n","<P>11    to check that there isn't one there that may be susceptible to individual</P>\n","<P>12    perpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he's working with others.</P>\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually</P>\n","<P>16    your case.  It's not that he acted alone.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. NICE:  Subject to the point I've just made.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you've made, yes.</P>\n","<P>19            MR.

You've just heard that explanation too.</P>\n","<P>23    Now, since you know the relationships very well between people at that</P>\n","<P>24    time, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and</P>\n","<P>25    Zvornik yourself.

NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and</P>\n","<P> 4    I think perhaps there's this qualification, although I don't think it is a</P>\n","<P> 5    qualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this</P>\n","<P> 6    accused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top</P>\n","<P> 7    political level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are</P>\n","<P> 8    criminal in nature.  It's the standard method of generation of</P>\n","<P> 9    genocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar</P>\n","<P>10    [phoen].</P>\n","<P>11            Now, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other</P>\n","<P>12    people.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may</P>\n","<P>13    be minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in</P>\n","<P>14    those circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting</P>\n","<P>15    alone in certain circumstances, but that's the only qualification I think</P>\n","<P>16    I should make.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it's a point that will warrant some</P>\n","<P>18    consideration later on, yes.</P>\n","<P>19            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>20            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   So Arkan is mentioned here as well as Mauzer.  Did I or anybody</P>\n","<P>22    else from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all</P>\n","<P>23    and with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   I'm quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.</P>\n","<P>25    On the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43672 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    contacts with Arkan.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many</P>\n","<P> 3    questions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the</P>\n","<P> 4    evidence he's giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,</P>\n","<P> 5    how is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan</P>\n","<P> 6    or Mauzer?</P>\n","<P> 7            He's giving evidence.  He's saying that you had nothing to do with</P>\n","<P> 8    him.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to</P>\n","<P> 9    establish how he's in a position to make that statement.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that</P>\n","<P>12    cannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from</P>\n","<P>13    the authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or</P>\n","<P>14    relationship with Arkan or Mauzer?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   In Belgrade you couldn't hide anything like that.  It would be</P>\n","<P>16    impossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is</P>\n","<P>17    that kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become</P>\n","<P>18    public.</P>\n","<P>19            Second, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts</P>\n","<P>20    only with Zoran Djindjic.  And I've already spoken about the relationship</P>\n","<P>21    between Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic's vice-president and the</P>\n","<P>22    president of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his</P>\n","<P>23    pre-electoral campaign.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   Let's clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did</P>\n","<P>25    you have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43673 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    able to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in</P>\n","<P> 2    Bijeljina?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina</P>\n","<P> 4    sufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,</P>\n","<P> 5    including Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this</P>\n","<P> 6    trial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events</P>\n","<P> 7    that went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in</P>\n","<P> 8    Bijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements</P>\n","<P> 9    and held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and</P>\n","<P>10    severely criticised Mauzer's conduct, especially Mauzer's conduct towards</P>\n","<P>11    the Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am</P>\n","<P>12    preparing them for my own trial, which doesn't seem to be starting.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack</P>\n","<P>14    on the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the</P>\n","<P>15    JNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by</P>\n","<P>16    the Red Berets or, rather, Arkan's and Seselj's men.  So that's the</P>\n","<P>17    quotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan's</P>\n","<P>18    and Seselj's men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red</P>\n","<P>19    Berets were they?  What Arkan's men were they, Seselj's men were they</P>\n","<P>20    around Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the</P>\n","<P>22    witness don't seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened</P>\n","<P>23    to see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red</P>\n","<P>24    cap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.</P>\n","<P>25    And then he -- the witness doesn't know whether they were Seselj's men or</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43674 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Arkan's men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it's</P>\n","<P> 2    highly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of</P>\n","<P> 3    his head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify</P>\n","<P> 4    so-called Seselj's men and Arkan's men and these alleged Red Berets.</P>\n","<P> 5            As for the Red Berets, I've already given you reliable facts about</P>\n","<P> 6    them and said that name appeared in different situations relating to</P>\n","<P> 7    different military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina</P>\n","<P> 8    area where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then</P>\n","<P> 9    the army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of</P>\n","<P>10    the intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until</P>\n","<P>11    the special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of</P>\n","<P>12    Serbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this</P>\n","<P>13    misunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed</P>\n","<P>14    to people with -- which they had nothing to do with.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the</P>\n","<P>16    following:  \"Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P>17    who were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done.\"</P>\n","<P>18    That's when this witness claims.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He's a colonel by</P>\n","<P>20    rank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff</P>\n","<P>21    of the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the</P>\n","<P>22    number two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that's the same</P>\n","<P>23    Osman Selak that you're referring to.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   Well, I can't tell you that.</P>\n","<P>25       A.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43675 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a</P>\n","<P> 2    statement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,</P>\n","<P> 3    what the circumstances were in which I said it.</P>\n","<P> 4            I did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the</P>\n","<P> 5    secession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia</P>\n","<P> 6    seceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,</P>\n","<P> 7    and for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he</P>\n","<P> 8    personally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.</P>\n","<P> 9            As far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from</P>\n","<P>10    Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of</P>\n","<P>11    Yugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and</P>\n","<P>12    Raska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of</P>\n","<P>13    examples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army</P>\n","<P>14    perform their duty very honourably.</P>\n","<P>15            So the citizens --</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are</P>\n","<P>18    saying that you did make such a statement or you didn't make such a</P>\n","<P>19    statement.</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if</P>\n","<P>21    you don't show me something like that here, where and when.  Let us see</P>\n","<P>22    the statement concerned.  Let me identify it.  I gave thousands and</P>\n","<P>23    thousands of statements in public.  They were publicly recorded.  They</P>\n","<P>24    were published.  So let's see.</P>\n","<P>25            My objection is precisely in that.  Why did this Osman Selak not</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43676 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    say where and when?</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's helpful to some extent.  Does it follow from</P>\n","<P> 3    the answer you've just given that you could have said it?</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I could have said it along the</P>\n","<P> 5    following lines, that those in the army who came from the renegade</P>\n","<P> 6    republics in principle should not remain at positions in the Yugoslav</P>\n","<P> 7    army.  You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live</P>\n","<P> 8    in Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in</P>\n","<P> 9    the army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as</P>\n","<P>10    officers?</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's simply confusing me further.  The quote was</P>\n","<P>12    that you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims</P>\n","<P>13    and Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that</P>\n","<P>14    you could possibly have made that statement in these terms?</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not saying that I made that kind</P>\n","<P>16    of statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak</P>\n","<P>17    testified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise</P>\n","<P>18    lines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman</P>\n","<P>19    Selak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be</P>\n","<P>20    established.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the</P>\n","<P>21    Prosecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly</P>\n","<P>22    what I said.</P>\n","<P>23            I am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,</P>\n","<P>24    but it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you're asking me to do is</P>\n","<P>25    to comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43677 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Selak's view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make</P>\n","<P> 2    my statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm</P>\n","<P> 4    trying to understand the answer you've given to the question asked by</P>\n","<P> 5    Mr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you've just said, the problem is</P>\n","<P> 6    that you've been studying this yourself, and you're trying to justify a</P>\n","<P> 7    position of your own without really dealing specifically with the question</P>\n","<P> 8    that's being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears</P>\n","<P> 9    now to be that you couldn't possibly have made a statement of that nature,</P>\n","<P>10    although you might have said something much more specific about different</P>\n","<P>11    people but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.</P>\n","<P>12            Now, is that a fair summary of your position?</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I'm not sure, by think you're</P>\n","<P>14    very close.  However, in order to help you, I'm going to give you an</P>\n","<P>15    example.</P>\n","<P>16            Throughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were</P>\n","<P>17    informed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,</P>\n","<P>18    escaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of</P>\n","<P>19    confidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998</P>\n","<P>20    we had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of</P>\n","<P>21    the military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his</P>\n","<P>22    family abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives</P>\n","<P>23    there.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn't remotely sound as if it's</P>\n","<P>25    going to be at all helpful to me, so we'll proceed with Mr. Milosevic's</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43678 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    questions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you</P>\n","<P> 2    was about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist</P>\n","<P> 3    statement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple</P>\n","<P> 4    issue I'm not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further</P>\n","<P> 5    if he wishes.</P>\n","<P> 6            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in</P>\n","<P>11    no uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that</P>\n","<P>12    any statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never</P>\n","<P>13    in my life have I made a racist statement.</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>\n","<P>19            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  There's nothing for you to respond to.</P>\n","<P>21            Mr. Milosevic, the next question.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I'm afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I</P>\n","<P>24    put a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific</P>\n","<P>25    terms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43679 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    here that \"Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 2    who were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed.\"  Did you ever state</P>\n","<P> 3    that?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I didn't say it that way.</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   So you didn't say it that way --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... matter.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  And why on earth it should take all this time to</P>\n","<P> 8    establish that simple issue, I do not know.</P>\n","<P> 9            Perhaps it would help, Mr. Seselj, if you just listened to the</P>\n","<P>10    questions and answer the question that's actually asked rather than try to</P>\n","<P>11    make political statements about your own position.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic --</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not making political statements,</P>\n","<P>14    Mr. Bonomy.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He</P>\n","<P>17    mentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether</P>\n","<P>18    those facts are correct.  And first of all, I'm interested in the</P>\n","<P>19    circumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  \"Just after</P>\n","<P>20    the bombing Seselj came to Pale.\"  And then on page 26762 he</P>\n","<P>21    says:  \"Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to</P>\n","<P>22    support the Bosnian Serbs.\"  These are a few facts that referred to.</P>\n","<P>23    Could you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this</P>\n","<P>24    actually all about?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43680 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the</P>\n","<P> 2    leadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly</P>\n","<P> 3    engaged in an anti-Serb policy.</P>\n","<P> 4            As for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market</P>\n","<P> 5    itself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the</P>\n","<P> 6    street of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these</P>\n","<P> 7    are explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of</P>\n","<P> 8    whether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar</P>\n","<P> 9    shells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.</P>\n","<P>10            This was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the</P>\n","<P>11    Serbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the</P>\n","<P>12    threats that were made, and so on and so forth.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there</P>\n","<P>14    you did so only to give political support to the leadership of</P>\n","<P>15    Republika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and</P>\n","<P>16    bombing.</P>\n","<P>17       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  \"In January or February</P>\n","<P>19    1992\" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, \"Arkan's</P>\n","<P>20    and Seselj's units arrived in Doboj.\"</P>\n","<P>21            Is this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?</P>\n","<P>22       A.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,</P>\n","<P>23    there were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.</P>\n","<P>24            Secondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to</P>\n","<P>25    Doboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan's Tigers never</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43681 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    operated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to</P>\n","<P> 3    this question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript page 27738, quite explicitly, \"Mirko Blagojevic,\" that is to</P>\n","<P> 5    say, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he</P>\n","<P> 6    says:  \"Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,</P>\n","<P> 7    and he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with</P>\n","<P> 8    Seselj.\"</P>\n","<P> 9            I am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>10    Party or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that</P>\n","<P>11    Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So</P>\n","<P>12    please deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the</P>\n","<P>13    transcript.  Is it correct or not?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is</P>\n","<P>15    organised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A</P>\n","<P>16    conflict occurs when two armed formations clash.</P>\n","<P>17            Mirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in</P>\n","<P>18    Bijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim</P>\n","<P>19    formations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any</P>\n","<P>20    conflicts.  And I guarantee with my own life that he took part in no</P>\n","<P>21    looting, no persecutions, no maltreatment of the civilian population and</P>\n","<P>22    so on and so forth.  I'm absolutely certain of that.</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Thank you.</P>\n","<P>24       A.   I can fully identify with everything that Mirko Blagojevic did.</P>\n","<P>25    It is to that degree that I'm certain that he never did anything against</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43682 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43683 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    the law.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  \"Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 3    men tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm.\"</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   My understanding is it's somewhere near Zvornik.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   That's quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 7    Party took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there</P>\n","<P> 8    in brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on</P>\n","<P> 9    for a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the</P>\n","<P>10    Muslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to</P>\n","<P>11    an end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>12    withdrew.</P>\n","<P>13            I preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on</P>\n","<P>14    guarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing</P>\n","<P>15    happened, I would have had to know about it.</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you</P>\n","<P>17    personally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following</P>\n","<P>18    circumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  \"Seselj,</P>\n","<P>19    on Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired</P>\n","<P>20    it at Muslims in Sarajevo.\"  This was shown on television, and he said</P>\n","<P>21    that you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at</P>\n","<P>23    Grbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called</P>\n","<P>24    international observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go</P>\n","<P>25    around the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43684 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Serb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was</P>\n","<P> 2    an apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I</P>\n","<P> 3    used a Browning machine-gun from there.  It's a heavy machine-gun.  I</P>\n","<P> 4    couldn't carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry</P>\n","<P> 5    it around.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   You cannot carry it.  It's too long.  It was installed in that</P>\n","<P> 8    building, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches</P>\n","<P> 9    below the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of</P>\n","<P>10    the volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was</P>\n","<P>11    firing from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and</P>\n","<P>12    the top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is</P>\n","<P>13    something I don't know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who</P>\n","<P>14    could have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this</P>\n","<P>15    small participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.</P>\n","<P>16            A Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that</P>\n","<P>17    case, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been</P>\n","<P>18    forced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of</P>\n","<P>19    those who in violation of international law of war brought him out there</P>\n","<P>20    to dig trenches, not those who --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,</P>\n","<P>24    that at the beginning of April Seselj's men arrived in the area of</P>\n","<P>25    Bratunac and Zvornik.</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43685 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic's part.  He knows</P>\n","<P> 2    full well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing</P>\n","<P> 3    who he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and</P>\n","<P> 4    making this sweeping statement Seselj's men arrived in Bratunac and</P>\n","<P> 5    Zvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it's as if they were in Bratunac</P>\n","<P> 6    too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so</P>\n","<P> 7    Deronjic invented that.</P>\n","<P> 8            In Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the</P>\n","<P> 9    Bratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was</P>\n","<P>10    commander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he</P>\n","<P>11    was not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,</P>\n","<P>12    then a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.  I think the interpreter is having</P>\n","<P>14    some difficulty.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will.</P>\n","<P>16            You could have noticed, Mr. Robinson, that I have been trying as</P>\n","<P>17    of late to speak slowly, but sometimes, every now and then, I may forget</P>\n","<P>18    what you cautioned me about.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, I had noticed, and the -- we are</P>\n","<P>20    appreciative of the effort you are making.  You have answered the</P>\n","<P>21    question.</P>\n","<P>22            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the meantime --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think you have answered that question.</P>\n","<P>24            MR.

No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in</P>\n","<P> 2    Bratunac.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   All right.  So you are saying that he's not telling the truth.</P>\n","<P> 4            The same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not</P>\n","<P> 5    agree that Seselj was a true opposition.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   The Hague OTP and Judge Schomburg on several occasions caught</P>\n","<P> 7    Deronjic lying.  And even in Deronjic's judgement you can find about seven</P>\n","<P> 8    different points as ascertained by Judge Schomburg, namely that Deronjic</P>\n","<P> 9    was lying.</P>\n","<P>10            Secondly, in the case of people who are inclined to a pro-Western</P>\n","<P>11    policy or are mercenaries of Western intelligence agencies, or in order to</P>\n","<P>12    save their own skin they go into plea bargaining with the OTP and</P>\n","<P>13    therefore appear as witnesses in the trials of other people, it can often</P>\n","<P>14    be heard that those who are really opposition but are not prepared to</P>\n","<P>15    serve the West --</P>\n","<P>16            MR.

This</P>\n","<P> 7    was Witness 1070.</P>\n","<P> 8            On page 20351 he says that Seselj's men were in Bratunac and that</P>\n","<P> 9    there was no difference between them and Seselj's men, the White Eagles,</P>\n","<P>10    that is.</P>\n","<P>11            And on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April</P>\n","<P>12    Seselj's and Arkan's men were in Bratunac together when some people were</P>\n","<P>13    deported.  And Mr. Seselj answered questions about this.  In the meantime,</P>\n","<P>14    the liaison officer had the transcript, and I have received a note saying</P>\n","<P>15    that both references are correct, both as regards page 20351 and 20352,</P>\n","<P>16    and these refer to Witness 1070.  There was no error.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  All right, Mr. Milosevic.  We'll do our own</P>\n","<P>18    check.  Thank you for checking anyhow.</P>\n","<P>19            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   Mr. Seselj, this is the testimony of Miroslav Deronjic, who said</P>\n","<P>21    that you were not truly an opposition politician or, rather, that you</P>\n","<P>22    cooperated with the government and that therefore this idea of a joint</P>\n","<P>23    criminal enterprise is thereby confirmed.  Were you in the opposition or</P>\n","<P>24    not?</P>\n","<P>25            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43688 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it</P>\n","<P> 2    on.</P>\n","<P> 3            Both the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time</P>\n","<P> 4    were distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as</P>\n","<P> 5    it's possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by</P>\n","<P> 6    Deronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the</P>\n","<P> 7    opposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint</P>\n","<P> 8    often expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various</P>\n","<P> 9    government and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person</P>\n","<P>10    of the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or</P>\n","<P>11    Miles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery</P>\n","<P>12    and so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while</P>\n","<P>13    criticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition</P>\n","<P>14    politicians, and this logic is completely upside down.</P>\n","<P>15            MR.

That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,</P>\n","<P>20    throughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did</P>\n","<P>21    not fight in any location.</P>\n","<P>22            This reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a</P>\n","<P>23    certain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying</P>\n","<P>24    that sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.</P>\n","<P>25    Somebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43690 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    arriving, and he spread panic.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that the Serbian word for</P>\n","<P> 3    sugar resembles Mr. Seselj's name.</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere</P>\n","<P> 5    in that area.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  \"From the</P>\n","<P> 8    1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan</P>\n","<P> 9    Milosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint</P>\n","<P>10    criminal,\" and so on,\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise</P>\n","<P>11    aided and abetted,\" and so on and so forth, all these phrases, \"the</P>\n","<P>12    planning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories</P>\n","<P>13    of Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>\n","<P>14    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.\"</P>\n","<P>15            Tell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in</P>\n","<P>16    this joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged</P>\n","<P>17    crimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made</P>\n","<P>18    here?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from</P>\n","<P>20    Serbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia</P>\n","<P>21    and Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted</P>\n","<P>22    to proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the</P>\n","<P>23    will of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the</P>\n","<P>24    West who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or</P>\n","<P>25    execution or extermination.  There was no plan.</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43691 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            When the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in</P>\n","<P> 2    many places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only</P>\n","<P> 3    where the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats</P>\n","<P> 4    were in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,</P>\n","<P> 5    not a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the</P>\n","<P> 6    majority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They</P>\n","<P> 7    had already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we</P>\n","<P> 9    have already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the</P>\n","<P>10    other places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>\n","<P>11    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in</P>\n","<P>12    any kind of military activities?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in</P>\n","<P>14    January, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but</P>\n","<P>15    the UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,</P>\n","<P>16    although they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was</P>\n","<P>17    established, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be</P>\n","\n","<P>18    disarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.</P>\n","<P>19            The Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian</P>\n","<P>20    villages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there</P>\n","<P>21    were two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active</P>\n","<P>22    in the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces</P>\n","<P>23    in the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the</P>\n","<P>24    only activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica</P>\n","<P>25    area.  It was in the beginning of 1993.</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43692 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            As for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,</P>\n","<P> 2    I don't know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up</P>\n","<P> 3    only in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all</P>\n","<P> 4    over Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army</P>\n","<P> 5    of the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska</P>\n","<P> 6    Krajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his</P>\n","<P> 7    volunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars</P>\n","<P> 8    there, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed</P>\n","<P>10    and what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy</P>\n","<P>11    that we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in</P>\n","<P>12    whole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and</P>\n","<P>13    Herzegovina?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and</P>\n","<P>15    there was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen</P>\n","<P>16    happened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on</P>\n","<P>17    their own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit</P>\n","<P>18    murders or anything of the kind.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war</P>\n","<P>20    in Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the</P>\n","<P>21    other participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by</P>\n","<P>22    Mr. Nice.</P>\n","<P>23            Look at paragraph 33.  We've just been discussing paragraph 32.  I</P>\n","<P>24    won't read the beginning of paragraph 33 because it's the same:  \"From on</P>\n","<P>25    or about the 1st of March, 1992,\" and so on and so forth, and then it</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43693 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    says:  \"On the territory of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa,</P>\n","<P> 2    Bosanski Novi, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Sarajevo (Ilijas), Kljuc,</P>\n","<P> 3    Kalinovik, Kotor Varos, Nevesinje, Sarajevo, Novi Grad, Sarajevo, Novo</P>\n","<P> 4    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Rudo, Sanski Most, Srebrenica</P>\n","<P> 5    again, Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\"  Please --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You are finished reading that list.

You</P>\n","<P> 2    know the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that</P>\n","<P> 3    referred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded</P>\n","<P> 4    in any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted</P>\n","<P> 6    to, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A</P>\n","<P> 7    civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally</P>\n","<P> 8    wanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a</P>\n","<P> 9    constituent people.</P>\n","<P>10            And the question arises from there where are the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>11    Mostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>12    Travnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>13    many other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats</P>\n","<P>14    during that civil war?</P>\n","<P>15            After the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the</P>\n","<P>16    population, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did</P>\n","<P>17    take place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,</P>\n","<P>18    in figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I</P>\n","<P>19    can put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes</P>\n","<P>20    crimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,</P>\n","<P>21    sometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,</P>\n","<P>22    criminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and</P>\n","<P>23    revenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes</P>\n","<P>24    did not exist.  That did not happen.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43696 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    joint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I'd like</P>\n","<P> 2    to draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of</P>\n","<P> 3    December, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33</P>\n","<P> 4    and indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns</P>\n","<P> 5    are repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns</P>\n","<P> 6    too.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.</P>\n","<P> 7            So what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during</P>\n","<P> 8    that period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of</P>\n","<P> 9    December 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring</P>\n","<P>10    Bosnia and Herzegovina?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia</P>\n","<P>12    or, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of</P>\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It</P>\n","<P>14    did not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help</P>\n","<P>15    materially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs</P>\n","<P>16    living over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different</P>\n","<P>17    political relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership</P>\n","<P>18    of Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in</P>\n","<P>19    which those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep</P>\n","<P>20    conflicts, and they didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues.</P>\n","<P>21            So throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the</P>\n","<P>22    indictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,</P>\n","<P>23    the leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered</P>\n","<P>24    in looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far</P>\n","<P>25    accepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43697 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    attacked ourselves for our part.</P>\n","<P> 2            So I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy</P>\n","<P> 3    dating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact</P>\n","<P> 4    that that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all</P>\n","<P> 5    costs.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no</P>\n","<P> 6    alternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at</P>\n","<P> 7    the price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept</P>\n","<P> 8    because they were not able to take such great concessions.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities</P>\n","<P>10    of that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these</P>\n","<P>11    towns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I</P>\n","<P>12    personally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,</P>\n","<P>13    et cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason</P>\n","<P>14    explanation?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Yes, I do, and that's explanation is the following and the fact</P>\n","<P>16    that through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,</P>\n","<P>17    and --</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not</P>\n","<P>19    an explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.</P>\n","<P>20            So please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,</P>\n","<P>23    Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac</P>\n","<P>24    again, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in</P>\n","<P>25    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43698 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with</P>\n","<P> 2    regard to that point of the indictment?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised</P>\n","<P> 4    crime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don't know whether in all the</P>\n","<P> 5    places enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took</P>\n","<P> 6    place in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each</P>\n","<P> 7    individual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the</P>\n","<P> 8    motives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are</P>\n","<P> 9    still living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can</P>\n","<P>10    be established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side</P>\n","<P>11    and the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to</P>\n","<P>12    investigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to</P>\n","<P>13    strike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the</P>\n","<P>14    number of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you've said when you said</P>\n","<P>16    that some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let's look at</P>\n","<P>17    that for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of</P>\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or</P>\n","<P>19    formations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes</P>\n","<P>20    that you know of?  Are there any links?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of</P>\n","<P>22    power and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as</P>\n","<P>23    well, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,</P>\n","<P>24    the Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the</P>\n","<P>25    Academy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43699 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    everybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out</P>\n","<P> 2    against them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for</P>\n","<P> 3    freedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were</P>\n","<P> 4    being perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes</P>\n","<P> 5    should be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind</P>\n","<P> 6    via the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political</P>\n","<P> 7    parties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which</P>\n","<P> 8    strove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors</P>\n","<P> 9    spoke out against crimes.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>11            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Now, we -- let's look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful</P>\n","<P>13    confinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,</P>\n","<P>14    Bosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the</P>\n","<P>15    territories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,</P>\n","<P>16    Samac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,</P>\n","<P>17    Kotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,</P>\n","<P>18    Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>19            Tell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these</P>\n","<P>20    people in these towns did we take part in?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have</P>\n","<P>22    had anything to do with any such thing.</P>\n","<P>23            First of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What</P>\n","<P>24    the confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of</P>\n","<P>25    civilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43700 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    unlawful, and there were such cases.</P>\n","<P> 2            Now, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of</P>\n","<P> 3    all, there were individual instances in some of these places through the</P>\n","<P> 4    self-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance</P>\n","<P> 5    of Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.</P>\n","<P> 6    And then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of</P>\n","<P> 7    their own because they couldn't influence him.  He appeared as a factor,</P>\n","<P> 8    and there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his</P>\n","<P> 9    motives were of a criminal nature.</P>\n","<P>10            There were other such cases in some of these places whereby</P>\n","<P>11    somebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in</P>\n","<P>12    order to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive</P>\n","<P>13    money and then release them once they received money for that.  There were</P>\n","<P>14    also instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,</P>\n","<P>15    somebody's family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or</P>\n","<P>16    Croats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often</P>\n","<P>17    were not able to prevent revenge of that kind.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Which authorities?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian</P>\n","<P>21    authorities intervene?</P>\n","<P>22       A.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn't influence or involve</P>\n","<P>23    themselves in any such matters.</P>\n","<P>24            So as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one</P>\n","<P>25    should take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43701 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    those cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and</P>\n","<P> 2    what the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.</P>\n","<P> 3            Now, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places</P>\n","<P> 4    where possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of</P>\n","<P> 5    context and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse</P>\n","<P> 6    top-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian</P>\n","<P> 7    Yugoslavia as well.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has</P>\n","<P> 9    become a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you</P>\n","<P>10    say that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing</P>\n","<P>11    like the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged</P>\n","<P>12    by the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn't understand me correctly,</P>\n","<P>14    Mr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,</P>\n","<P>15    but there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top</P>\n","<P>16    echelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely</P>\n","<P>17    impossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like</P>\n","<P>18    that, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is</P>\n","<P>19    impossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such</P>\n","<P>20    thing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did</P>\n","<P>21    commit crimes.  And it wasn't only individuals who committed crimes.</P>\n","<P>22    There was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.</P>\n","<P>23    And I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my</P>\n","<P>24    information, but I can't be well-versed in everything, but I can in</P>\n","<P>25    basics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43702 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    wasn't the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit</P>\n","<P> 2    crimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn't the policy of the</P>\n","<P> 3    leadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.</P>\n","<P> 4            Now, --</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn't the policy of this accused in</P>\n","<P> 6    concert with other --</P>\n","<P> 7            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of</P>\n","<P> 8    Mr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,</P>\n","<P> 9    continuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such</P>\n","<P>10    crimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the</P>\n","<P>11    most serious form of war crimes.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There's an enormous</P>\n","<P>15    list of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,</P>\n","<P>16    and the subject here is deportation.</P>\n","<P>17            Now, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let's clarify that.  Albeit in</P>\n","<P>18    Serbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,</P>\n","<P>19    Muslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,</P>\n","<P>20    70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle</P>\n","<P>21    of non-discrimination like anybody else.</P>\n","<P>22            Now, I can't clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is</P>\n","<P>23    being accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it</P>\n","<P>24    stated here -- it says:  \"Milosevic, acting alone or together with other</P>\n","<P>25    members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43703 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or</P>\n","<P> 2    execution of the unlawful forcible transfer...\"</P>\n","<P> 3            Now, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic</P>\n","<P> 4    of Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or</P>\n","<P> 5    unlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful</P>\n","<P> 6    movement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one</P>\n","<P> 7    individual?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with</P>\n","<P> 9    anything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these</P>\n","<P>10    phenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what</P>\n","<P>11    did happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group</P>\n","<P>12    to leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that</P>\n","<P>13    desire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were</P>\n","<P>14    instances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,</P>\n","<P>15    that people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,</P>\n","<P>16    something afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind</P>\n","<P>17    what had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to</P>\n","<P>18    move out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or</P>\n","<P>19    perhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they</P>\n","<P>20    were the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and</P>\n","<P>21    in some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established</P>\n","<P>22    in some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete</P>\n","<P>23    example, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from</P>\n","<P>24    Prijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a</P>\n","<P>25    convoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43704 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I'm stopping you because you have</P>\n","<P> 2    answered the question.  You are becoming a little too expansive.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think that this would be very</P>\n","<P> 4    important.</P>\n","<P> 5            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what example do you know of personally?</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   I'm talking about one example when Muslims were transported</P>\n","<P> 8    because they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And</P>\n","<P> 9    then the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose</P>\n","<P>10    name is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is</P>\n","<P>11    called Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large</P>\n","<P>12    group of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the</P>\n","<P>13    authorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part</P>\n","<P>14    of Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army</P>\n","<P>15    of Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.</P>\n","<P>16            Then he tried to explain this in a completely different way:</P>\n","<P>17    Somebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he's</P>\n","<P>18    trying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.</P>\n","<P>19            Such people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,</P>\n","<P>20    entered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and</P>\n","<P>21    then they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed</P>\n","<P>22    although they are invariably false because --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm stopping you.  Mr. Seselj, no doubt you're a</P>\n","<P>24    man of many virtues.  Is omniscience one of them?  How do you happen to</P>\n","<P>25    know all these things?

But I'm a constant learner, and I wish others</P>\n","<P> 8    were too.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  It would help my appreciation of your evidence if</P>\n","<P>10    only occasionally we were told of the basis for the information that you</P>\n","<P>11    have about specific matters.</P>\n","<P>12            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR.

Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of</P>\n","<P>15    Serbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and</P>\n","<P>16    that as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon</P>\n","<P>17    what do you base this statement?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I</P>\n","<P>19    base my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent</P>\n","<P>20    statements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.</P>\n","<P>21            Secondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.</P>\n","<P>22    They never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never</P>\n","<P>23    discriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the</P>\n","<P>24    authorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in</P>\n","<P>25    Bosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43706 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43707 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    and treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.</P>\n","<P> 2            So there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic</P>\n","<P> 3    whatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution</P>\n","<P> 4    of Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in</P>\n","<P> 5    Serbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal</P>\n","<P> 6    of money.  Perhaps not all of them were happy with what they got, but this</P>\n","<P> 7    involved major expenditure on the part of the state.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  But did the authorities of Serbia allow</P>\n","<P> 9    discrimination over any Muslim Croat or the member of any other ethnic</P>\n","<P>10    group in Serbia during the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   No.  Even if there were any incidents on ethnic grounds, the</P>\n","<P>12    authorities acted in accordance with the law and brought such matters to</P>\n","<P>13    trial.  They simply did not allow things like that to happen.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Please look at paragraph 42 now.

So I, Mr. Seselj, according to this paragraph 42, aided and</P>\n","<P>24    abetted the planning, preparation or execution, I executed this.  It</P>\n","<P>25    wasn't that I only aided and abetted others, but I committed wanton</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43708 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the Bosnian</P>\n","<P> 2    Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations, and again all these</P>\n","<P> 3    municipalities are listed here where I committed wanton looting of</P>\n","<P> 4    property belonging to Muslims and Croats.</P>\n","<P> 5            Please tell us not only what you know about this but also on the</P>\n","<P> 6    basis of what you know what you know.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in</P>\n","<P> 8    any way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of</P>\n","<P> 9    private and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three</P>\n","<P>10    sides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything</P>\n","<P>11    under control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.</P>\n","<P>12            What happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims</P>\n","<P>13    would loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have</P>\n","<P>14    their own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar</P>\n","<P>15    way in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no</P>\n","<P>16    official authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No</P>\n","<P>17    one personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,</P>\n","<P>18    et cetera.</P>\n","<P>19            There were paramilitary formations that had looting as their</P>\n","<P>20    primary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also</P>\n","<P>21    from Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People</P>\n","<P>22    travelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize</P>\n","<P>23    their car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were</P>\n","<P>24    such cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial</P>\n","<P>25    Chamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43709 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    looting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions</P>\n","<P> 2    that were rather chaotic.</P>\n","<P> 3            There was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.</P>\n","<P> 4    Not only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika</P>\n","<P> 5    Srpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in</P>\n","<P> 7    a military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto</P>\n","<P> 8    civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and</P>\n","<P> 9    wounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.</P>\n","<P>10            You were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please</P>\n","<P>11    explain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,</P>\n","<P>12    tell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of</P>\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.</P>\n","<P>14       A.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a</P>\n","<P>15    dissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict</P>\n","<P>16    in Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of</P>\n","<P>17    the duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case</P>\n","<P>18    elsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on</P>\n","<P>19    both sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less</P>\n","<P>20    casualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what</P>\n","<P>21    Judge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I</P>\n","<P>22    read.</P>\n","<P>23            I was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the</P>\n","<P>24    killing of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted</P>\n","<P>25    intentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43710 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Muslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present</P>\n","<P> 2    this in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,</P>\n","<P> 3    Vasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not</P>\n","<P> 4    take part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official</P>\n","<P> 5    factors from Serbia, that is.</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.  On the transcript it's a double</P>\n","<P> 7    negative.</P>\n","<P> 8            Yes, Mr. --</P>\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] There is a double negative in the</P>\n","<P>10    Serbian language and it does not change the meaning of the statement.  In</P>\n","<P>11    English it might mean something different.  I'm sorry I don't know English</P>\n","<P>12    and I cannot really adjust to this.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or</P>\n","<P>15    deny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took</P>\n","<P>16    part in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you</P>\n","<P>17    confirm that?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   All right.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The</P>\n","<P>21    Muslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the</P>\n","<P>22    liberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his</P>\n","<P>24    witness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,</P>\n","<P>25    including women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43711 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only</P>\n","<P> 2    logical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee</P>\n","<P> 3    from war.  They're fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.</P>\n","<P> 4            Very often in this war and in any other war civilians would get</P>\n","<P> 5    killed by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from</P>\n","<P> 6    the conflict.</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the</P>\n","<P> 8    Serbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it's supposed</P>\n","<P> 9    to seem?</P>\n","<P>10       A.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray</P>\n","<P>11    this, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their</P>\n","<P>12    victims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We</P>\n","<P>13    are faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is</P>\n","<P>14    based and anti-Serb grounds.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings</P>\n","<P>16    happened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all</P>\n","<P>17    of that can be found here in this indictment that I've been quoting to</P>\n","<P>18    you, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to</P>\n","<P>20    give.  Ask another question.</P>\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a</P>\n","<P>22    question to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that</P>\n","<P>23    he can give an answer.  He's a politician, an intellectual, a university</P>\n","<P>24    professor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,</P>\n","<P>25    and he is in a position to give an answer to this question.</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43712 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And I've already ruled that he is not to answer</P>\n","<P> 2    it.  So proceed.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the</P>\n","<P> 6    JNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know</P>\n","<P> 7    about that?  This is on transcript page 20408.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The</P>\n","<P> 9    two sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the</P>\n","<P>10    bridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric</P>\n","<P>11    power plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to</P>\n","<P>12    destroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old</P>\n","<P>13    hydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the</P>\n","<P>14    paramilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The</P>\n","<P>15    conflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can't say exactly, I</P>\n","<P>16    wasn't there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And</P>\n","<P>17    then also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units</P>\n","<P>19    committed crimes in Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there</P>\n","<P>21    that can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but</P>\n","<P>22    who it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are</P>\n","<P>23    ascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to</P>\n","<P>24    Karadzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.</P>\n","<P>25            In Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43713 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    people for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing</P>\n","<P> 5    them, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They</P>\n","<P> 6    are mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided</P>\n","<P> 7    by Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,</P>\n","<P> 8    Drinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you</P>\n","<P> 9    heard anything about this and what do you know about it?</P>\n","<P>10       A.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my</P>\n","<P>11    knowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but</P>\n","<P>12    once the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very</P>\n","<P>13    simply, who the victims were and who the executors were.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the</P>\n","<P>15    cultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many</P>\n","<P>16    persons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force</P>\n","<P>17    there is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I'll just go</P>\n","<P>18    on.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were</P>\n","<P>20    committed.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn't the JNA that</P>\n","<P>21    took part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take</P>\n","<P>22    part in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully</P>\n","<P>23    investigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims</P>\n","<P>24    are still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether</P>\n","<P>25    there was enough will to investigate this matter, and I've already</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43714 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    referred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect</P>\n","<P> 2    a great deal from that.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I don't know anything about it.  I wasn't there.</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj and Mr. Milosevic, you are not</P>\n","<P> 6    observing the pause between question and answer, and you are thereby</P>\n","<P> 7    creating difficulties for the interpreter.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, this is the first time</P>\n","<P> 9    you have warned us about this today.  As you see, Mr. Seselj and I are</P>\n","<P>10    bearing this in mind.</P>\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We're practising.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment</P>\n","<P>14    in this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your</P>\n","<P>15    units.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan's men.  Do</P>\n","<P>16    you have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your</P>\n","<P>17    units were there?  You've already explained you didn't have any units of</P>\n","<P>18    yours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers</P>\n","<P>19    were there?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I'm not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik</P>\n","<P>21    area.  I know that Arkan's Tigers were active there but to what extent and</P>\n","<P>22    in what locations I couldn't say because I wasn't there.</P>\n","<P>23            All the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I</P>\n","<P>24    do not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and</P>\n","<P>25    misfortunes he talked about, but evidently he's very confused when</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43715 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    identifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He's mixing up Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 2    men, the White Eagles, Arkan's men, and this shows that he's very confused</P>\n","<P> 3    and unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers</P>\n","<P> 4    of the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to</P>\n","<P> 5    everything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very</P>\n","<P> 6    often it's beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn't be easy to</P>\n","<P> 7    establish who actually perpetrated this.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a</P>\n","<P> 9    certain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the</P>\n","<P>10    transcript.  Do you know anything about this?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>12    committed any crimes in that place.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>14    Radical Party?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>16    sent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,</P>\n","<P>17    and as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me</P>\n","<P>18    had any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I'm sure of it.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Would other volunteers have reported this?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and</P>\n","<P>21    they would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,</P>\n","<P>22    because this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about</P>\n","<P>24    the conducts of the volunteers?</P>\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn't say the reports were</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43716 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    regular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out</P>\n","<P> 2    how the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All</P>\n","<P> 3    the problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of</P>\n","<P> 4    indiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers</P>\n","<P> 5    to be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline</P>\n","<P> 6    of the other men.</P>\n","<P> 7            I was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the</P>\n","<P> 8    conclusion that none occurred.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral</P>\n","<P>11    conversations.</P>\n","<P>12            I'm convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written</P>\n","<P>13    reports would have been sent to me.  I'm sure that the competent command</P>\n","<P>14    would have told me had something like this happened.</P>\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>16            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Mr. Seselj, if you can't recall it doesn't matter, but is it true</P>\n","<P>18    that in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,</P>\n","<P>19    1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of</P>\n","<P>20    Seselj's men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj's men, then</P>\n","<P>22    should be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell</P>\n","<P>23    you whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group</P>\n","<P>24    of Seselj's men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he's</P>\n","<P>25    the leader if they don't know his name?  What does the term \"leader\" mean?</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43717 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Was he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times</P>\n","<P> 2    that volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in</P>\n","<P> 3    units larger than a company.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I</P>\n","<P> 6    have a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I</P>\n","<P> 7    wanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the</P>\n","<P> 8    indictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no</P>\n","<P> 9    such instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>10    Party.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such</P>\n","<P>14    instances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various</P>\n","<P>15    allegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of</P>\n","<P>16    time.</P>\n","<P>17            Please tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about</P>\n","<P>18    the events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men</P>\n","<P>19    participated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.</P>\n","<P>20       A.

In paragraph 42 Bosanski Samac is ascribed to you.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Well, all the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are</P>\n","<P>18    ascribed to me.  There aren't any which are not ascribed to me.  But what</P>\n","<P>19    do you know about the events there?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I don't understand this question.  You</P>\n","<P>21    can't just ask a question, take a municipality and say, \"What do you know</P>\n","<P>22    about events there?\"  There's got to be some point to the question.</P>\n","<P>23            Now, what is this dealing with?</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Very well.  I won't ask you anything about that, then, because I</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43720 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    can't find the reference now.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, Mr. Milosevic.

Don't assume</P>\n","<P>11    that because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he's the</P>\n","<P>12    best person to contradict it.</P>\n","<P>13            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.</P>\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   On page 23520 of the transcript.  I'll skip over the witness's</P>\n","<P>16    name because I can't recall at present whether or not he was protected,</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Robinson.  I don't think he was, because I don't have any note to that</P>\n","<P>18    effect, but he says:  \"In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the</P>\n","<P>19    White Wolves, and the JNA participated.\"</P>\n","<P>20            Do you know anything about this?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,</P>\n","<P>22    there was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from</P>\n","<P>23    Eastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the</P>\n","<P>24    indictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.</P>\n","<P>25    His name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43721 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    helicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was</P>\n","<P> 2    accompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 3    Party, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for</P>\n","<P> 4    sure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also</P>\n","<P> 5    Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as</P>\n","<P> 6    the Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was</P>\n","<P> 7    charged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in</P>\n","<P> 8    Banja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 9    Party.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and</P>\n","<P>10    the party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don't know that Kragujevac</P>\n","<P>12    is not in Bosnia.</P>\n","<P>13       A.   That's correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I'm getting ready</P>\n","<P>14    to obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was</P>\n","<P>15    expelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan</P>\n","<P>16    Savic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the</P>\n","<P>17    Serb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave</P>\n","<P>18    my legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial</P>\n","<P>19    and all the accompanying materials.</P>\n","<P>20            As for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to</P>\n","<P>21    me certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man</P>\n","<P>22    Radovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his</P>\n","<P>23    participation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.</P>\n","<P>24            Those are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members</P>\n","<P>25    of the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43722 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    had previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even</P>\n","<P> 2    called him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was</P>\n","<P> 3    Srecko Radovanovic.</P>\n","<P> 4            There was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was</P>\n","<P> 5    certainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was</P>\n","<P> 6    certainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been</P>\n","<P> 7    he would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that</P>\n","<P> 8    unit was called the Grey Wolves.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I've understood</P>\n","<P>10    from that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions</P>\n","<P>11    in Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you've said?</P>\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,</P>\n","<P>13    yes.</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called</P>\n","<P>15    the Grey Wolves active there?</P>\n","<P>16            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it's very problematic to say</P>\n","<P>17    paramilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means</P>\n","<P>18    outside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial</P>\n","<P>19    Defence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I'm not</P>\n","<P>20    sure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,</P>\n","<P>21    I think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good</P>\n","<P>22    fighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what</P>\n","<P>23    happened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called</P>\n","<P>24    Crkvina or something like that.  I can't recall it all off the top of my</P>\n","<P>25    head, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43723 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Banja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven't dealt with.  Did</P>\n","<P> 3    they participate?</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What</P>\n","<P> 5    Red Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's a perfectly legitimate answer for you to</P>\n","<P> 7    give, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the</P>\n","<P> 8    Red Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the</P>\n","<P> 9    quotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,</P>\n","<P>10    which on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they've got</P>\n","<P>11    nothing to do with the question.  So all I'm doing now is trying to find</P>\n","<P>12    out what the real answer to that question is.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.</P>\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the</P>\n","<P>15    Red Berets.</P>\n","<P>16                          --- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.</P>\n","<P>17                          --- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the</P>\n","<P>19    technical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary</P>\n","<P>20    resulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected</P>\n","<P>21    witness.</P>\n","<P>22            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>23            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43724 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Wolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also</P>\n","<P> 2    mentioned.  Now, the witness, I don't know whether he was protected or</P>\n","<P> 3    not, I don't want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript says that he saw 20 locals, and it's about Samac, wearing</P>\n","<P> 5    uniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed</P>\n","<P> 6    they were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned</P>\n","<P> 7    to Samac.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, I don't have any information to that effect, and that is</P>\n","<P> 9    quite impossible.  I'd like to point out once again that in different</P>\n","<P>10    places they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had</P>\n","<P>11    found some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have</P>\n","<P>12    been various units, especially as we're talking about locals in this</P>\n","<P>13    particular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What</P>\n","<P>14    does it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some</P>\n","<P>15    warehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they</P>\n","<P>16    were some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the</P>\n","<P>17    Red Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of</P>\n","<P>18    the State Security in 1996.</P>\n","<P>19            So quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term</P>\n","<P>20    applies to different concepts.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I</P>\n","<P>22    think that is in the indictment against you but you'll put me right if I'm</P>\n","<P>23    wrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,</P>\n","<P>24    that is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,</P>\n","<P>25    wherein amongst others you said:  \"Dear brother Chetniks, especially you</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43725 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    across the Drina, you're the bravest, and we're going to clear up Bosnia</P>\n","<P> 2    from the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong.\"  Is</P>\n","<P> 3    it true that you said that?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and</P>\n","<P> 5    partially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,</P>\n","<P> 6    because -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don't always know</P>\n","<P> 7    the Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an</P>\n","<P> 8    artificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the</P>\n","<P> 9    Croats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian</P>\n","<P>10    variation \"pogan\" means \"pagan,\" where as in the Serb language \"pogan\"</P>\n","<P>11    means \"waste\" or \"faeces.\"  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and</P>\n","<P>12    pan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called</P>\n","<P>13    them \"pogani,\" which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the</P>\n","<P>14    Muslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I'm not a stupid</P>\n","<P>15    man.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have</P>\n","<P>16    nothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more</P>\n","<P>17    than I do to all the Christians afterwards, let's make that point clear,</P>\n","<P>18    but I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --</P>\n","<P>19    greatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims</P>\n","<P>20    to be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.</P>\n","<P>21            So here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion</P>\n","<P>22    is being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,</P>\n","<P>23    and I've been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,</P>\n","<P>24    Islamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they</P>\n","<P>25    first appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43726 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.  Well, if you</P>\n","<P> 4    haven't got if it in my books then the Prosecution probably has a copy</P>\n","<P> 5    because most of my speeches were published in my books, in my works so, if</P>\n","<P> 6    a speech does not happen to be there, if --</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  Was this one published in your books?  I apologise.</P>\n","<P> 8    I haven't read them all.</P>\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson [sic], two years ago I</P>\n","<P>10    handed over to The Hague Tribunal 80 of my printed works.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  Is this speech in any of them?</P>\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Most probably, but it would be up to</P>\n","<P>13    the Prosecution to find it, not me.  I can't look through that whole</P>\n","<P>14    matter myself, because I didn't make the statement only in one place.  I</P>\n","<P>15    made the statement in several places, on several occasions.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  Well, normally the party presenting the evidence is</P>\n","<P>17    responsible for getting it to court in some -- as official as is possible,</P>\n","<P>18    but you're not aware of a copy of it being available for us as part of the</P>\n","<P>19    papers in connection with your evidence.</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Bonomy, the side that has</P>\n","<P>21    referred to my alleged speech is the Prosecution's side.  So I'm just</P>\n","<P>22    telling you where they made a mistake.  So they can find the original of</P>\n","<P>23    the speech and present it here.  I can't do the work of the Prosecution.</P>\n","<P>24    I can't be expected to do that.  I am testifying to the facts and</P>\n","<P>25    circumstances about which I have knowledge.  I'm not here to help the</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43727 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Prosecution out in its work.  And for my part, I have contributed</P>\n","<P> 2    sufficiently by handing over all my books.  They have far greater</P>\n","<P> 3    resources than I do.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Nice, can you help?  Where do I locate the</P>\n","<P> 5    evidence, readily locate the evidence in relation to this?</P>\n","<P> 6            MR.

It may be possible.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  It appears Mr. Seselj is suggesting that there is</P>\n","<P> 9    evidence of this speech led by the Prosecution in this case.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  It may be in this case or it may be in the pre-trial</P>\n","<P>11    brief of his own case.  I'll deal with it as soon as I can.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  All right.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. NICE:  We can't of course be guided in the way we are going to</P>\n","<P>14    present our questions through his observations.  We'll make our own</P>\n","<P>15    decisions.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  No, no, no.  That's nothing to the point.  I'm just</P>\n","<P>17    trying to clarify where I can read this speech, but if no one's going to</P>\n","<P>18    help me, that's okay.</P>\n","<P>19            MR.

Witness B1643 who testified pursuant to 92 bis, I assume you know</P>\n","<P>23    the written part, mentioned torture and capture of civilians in the SUP</P>\n","<P>24    building of the Territorial Defence in the primary school and secondary</P>\n","<P>25    school in Crkvina, the warehouse there.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43728 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, I already mentioned something about this.  I said that the</P>\n","<P> 2    Crkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey</P>\n","<P> 3    Wolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was</P>\n","<P> 4    arrested, but I don't have any details about how the trial proceeded and</P>\n","<P> 5    the upshot.  I asked my legal advisors to find the complete dossier of</P>\n","<P> 6    that trial, but I do know for certain that he was arrested and taken to</P>\n","<P> 7    trial in Banja Luka, prosecuted in Banja Luka.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   The indictment against you, in the indictment you are accused of</P>\n","<P> 9    an act on the 7th of May, 1992, which allegedly happened there which says</P>\n","<P>10    that two leaders of your group under your command killed 18 males at the</P>\n","<P>11    agricultural farm in Crkvina.  Is that the event you are referring to?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn't there</P>\n","<P>13    nor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical</P>\n","<P>14    Party.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   That's all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your</P>\n","<P>16    answer suffices.</P>\n","<P>17            You are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when</P>\n","<P>18    allegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated</P>\n","<P>19    killed 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating</P>\n","<P>21    on the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?</P>\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was</P>\n","<P>23    quoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>\n","<P>24    So it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this</P>\n","<P>25    question of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43729 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    concept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he</P>\n","<P> 2    stands accused, because he's testifying here.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily</P>\n","<P> 4    relevant for that purpose.</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I'm not going to</P>\n","<P> 6    insist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.</P>\n","<P> 7            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993</P>\n","<P> 9    some members of your alleged --</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have</P>\n","<P>11    continued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not</P>\n","<P>12    see at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial</P>\n","<P>13    here.  I know that he's alleged to be a member of the joint criminal</P>\n","<P>14    enterprise.  I'm well aware of that.  But that doesn't let in any and all</P>\n","<P>15    kind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.</P>\n","<P>16            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see</P>\n","<P>17    here that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,</P>\n","<P>18    then that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren't true</P>\n","<P>19    either, and he has refuted a number of witnesses' statements here that I</P>\n","<P>20    quoted.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know</P>\n","<P>22    you know that.</P>\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.

Do you</P>\n","<P> 3    know anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked</P>\n","<P> 4    to killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire</P>\n","<P> 6    in Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front</P>\n","<P> 7    line stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part</P>\n","<P> 8    under Muslim control and another part under Serb control.</P>\n","<P> 9            Now, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind</P>\n","<P>10    the following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from</P>\n","<P>11    rifles which wasn't a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because</P>\n","<P>12    sniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with</P>\n","<P>13    optic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the</P>\n","<P>14    Serb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to</P>\n","<P>15    come by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black</P>\n","<P>16    market.  I don't exclude the possibility of individual cases there being</P>\n","<P>17    the need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was</P>\n","<P>18    opened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain</P>\n","<P>19    control of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two</P>\n","<P>20    sides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn't</P>\n","<P>21    change for many years, and one or the other side would take control of</P>\n","<P>22    certain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.</P>\n","<P>23            On the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional</P>\n","<P>24    killing of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims</P>\n","<P>25    killed about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43732 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    in Kazani and so on.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the</P>\n","<P> 3    Sarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present</P>\n","<P> 4    on both sides.  Is that true?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in</P>\n","<P> 6    Sarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The</P>\n","<P> 7    real snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far</P>\n","<P> 8    more than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more</P>\n","<P> 9    sophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more</P>\n","<P>10    favourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I've forgotten the evidence which I</P>\n","<P>12    think there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How</P>\n","<P>13    much personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the</P>\n","<P>14    conflict there.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to</P>\n","<P>16    the Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that</P>\n","<P>17    is.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.</P>\n","<P>18    At Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and</P>\n","<P>19    I met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh</P>\n","<P>20    shipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my</P>\n","<P>21    colleagues from university and also people whom I'd been to school with,</P>\n","<P>22    Muslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire</P>\n","<P>24    going on?</P>\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43733 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    stay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some</P>\n","<P> 2    dangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you</P>\n","<P> 3    had to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but</P>\n","<P> 4    there were no more serious conflicts at that time.</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR.

Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,</P>\n","<P> 8    referred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on</P>\n","<P> 9    page 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs</P>\n","<P>10    fired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in</P>\n","<P>11    Sarajevo?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open</P>\n","<P>13    fire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be</P>\n","<P>14    ascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused</P>\n","<P>15    protected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction</P>\n","<P>16    from the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo</P>\n","<P>17    they would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at</P>\n","<P>18    Serb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off</P>\n","<P>19    in the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,</P>\n","<P>20    then they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at</P>\n","<P>21    hospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,</P>\n","<P>22    who were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the</P>\n","<P>23    hospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw</P>\n","<P>24    quickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived</P>\n","<P>25    they didn't come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43734 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    fire in retaliation.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited</P>\n","<P> 3    Bijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --</P>\n","<P> 4    page 8258 of Alija Gusalic's -- 18258, and I link this up with your</P>\n","<P> 5    indictment and Alija Gusalic's testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina</P>\n","<P> 6    and members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to</P>\n","<P> 7    takeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite</P>\n","<P> 9    correct.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just</P>\n","<P>10    nonsense.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there</P>\n","<P>12    were Arkan's men and Seselj's men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything</P>\n","<P>13    about that?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb</P>\n","<P>15    Radical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I'm absolutely certain</P>\n","<P>16    of that.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   The same witness says on page 18260, \"Seselj's men had beards and</P>\n","<P>18    cockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to</P>\n","<P>19    distribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party.\"</P>\n","<P>20       A.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>21    Radical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly</P>\n","<P>22    clean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not</P>\n","<P>23    bring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot</P>\n","<P>24    be synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for</P>\n","<P>25    ideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43735 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    not a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier</P>\n","<P> 2    having a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not</P>\n","<P> 3    distribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role</P>\n","<P> 4    in these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.</P>\n","<P> 5            Members of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but</P>\n","<P> 6    exclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now</P>\n","<P> 8    I'm asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were</P>\n","<P> 9    not Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were</P>\n","<P>10    held at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you</P>\n","<P>11    know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   I don't know about those particular localities, but I've already</P>\n","<P>13    talked about Mauzer's and Arkan's conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for</P>\n","<P>14    that reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often</P>\n","<P>15    attacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   I'm sorry that I didn't draw your attention to this on time,</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you</P>\n","<P>18    are being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in</P>\n","<P>19    Batkovic.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I've already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>21    Radical Party there.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.</P>\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic</P>\n","<P>24    testified here, and he made those assertions here, and I'm linking that up</P>\n","<P>25    with --</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43736 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness</P>\n","<P> 2    made the allegations here.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp</P>\n","<P> 4    near Bijeljina.  And I've linked that up to what the indictment against</P>\n","<P> 5    Mr. Seselj says.</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that's not relevant.  Move on.</P>\n","<P> 7            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused</P>\n","<P> 9    Mr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a</P>\n","<P>10    hundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?</P>\n","<P>11            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it's not relevant to</P>\n","<P>13    this case.</P>\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the</P>\n","<P>15    basis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks</P>\n","<P>16    about Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj's indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane</P>\n","<P>18    treatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's indictment?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the</P>\n","<P>23    International Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything</P>\n","<P>24    about this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   I don't know anything about the visit of the International Red</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43737 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Cross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.</P>\n","<P> 2    Also, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of</P>\n","<P> 3    prisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not</P>\n","<P> 4    take part in any such thing.</P>\n","<P> 5            As for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and</P>\n","<P> 6    if there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would</P>\n","<P> 7    have to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right.  I'm not going to ask you about this anymore.  You</P>\n","<P> 9    mentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is</P>\n","<P>10    that right?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the</P>\n","<P>13    activity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the</P>\n","<P>14    situation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,</P>\n","<P>15    do you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no</P>\n","<P>17    paramilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in</P>\n","<P>18    Mostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,</P>\n","<P>19    from the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>20    Party were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them</P>\n","<P>21    as highly disciplined on Belgrade television.</P>\n","<P>22            If there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have</P>\n","<P>23    been members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention</P>\n","<P>24    platoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not</P>\n","<P>25    preclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43738 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    was not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp</P>\n","<P> 3    there were Seselj's Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   That is absolutely impossible.  I've never heard of the White</P>\n","<P> 6    Eagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven't heard of this Buna</P>\n","<P> 7    camp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 8    Party, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared</P>\n","<P> 9    in Buna.  I don't know anything about this, but there should be proper</P>\n","<P>10    records to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White</P>\n","<P>11    Eagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any</P>\n","<P>12    Red Berets.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in</P>\n","<P>14    Nevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I</P>\n","<P>16    was in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and</P>\n","<P>17    in the Neretva valley.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in</P>\n","<P>20    Nevesinje.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   That will do.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable</P>\n","<P>23    number of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no</P>\n","<P>24    conflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large</P>\n","<P>25    number of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43739 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    were put up at various facilities there.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Do you know anything about a lake, Boracko Jezero, and a rest</P>\n","<P> 3    house there where about 19 persons were killed, according to the</P>\n","<P> 4    allegations made?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers</P>\n","<P> 6    of the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That's close to</P>\n","<P> 7    Konjic.  I've already said that there were members of the Serb guard</P>\n","<P> 8    there.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was</P>\n","<P> 9    there, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was</P>\n","<P>10    operating.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan's Serb</P>\n","<P>12    volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared</P>\n","<P>16    elsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities</P>\n","<P>17    had a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because</P>\n","<P>18    they stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then</P>\n","<P>19    they appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a</P>\n","<P>20    lot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic's.  As far as I</P>\n","<P>21    know, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>\n","<P>23       A.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav</P>\n","<P>24    Lajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43740 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   The Serb guard.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Of Vuk Draskovic?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from</P>\n","<P> 4    Novi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made</P>\n","<P> 6    to the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.  I've forgotten</P>\n","<P> 7    his first name.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Jovan.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Jovan Dulovic who testified here.  Mr. Robinson instructed me to</P>\n","<P>10    find the original documents that can be linked up to your submissions</P>\n","<P>11    since they refused to admit your submissions.</P>\n","<P>12            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I am sorry, Mr. Robinson.  If you're</P>\n","<P>13    telling me to have copies made I will do that, but I've just received</P>\n","<P>14    these copies.  This is a series of photocopies of articles written by</P>\n","<P>15    Jovan Dulovic and published in Ekspres Politika from the 16th of November,</P>\n","<P>16    the 26th of November, all of that in 1991.  Then the 18th of November, the</P>\n","<P>17    2nd of November.  So from November 1991.</P>\n","<P>18            In these articles, he speaks very favourably of the JNA and</P>\n","<P>19    commends their behaviour in the fighting around Vukovar.  For example, he</P>\n","<P>20    says that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats, saw the light of</P>\n","<P>21    the day after having stayed in cellars for many --</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, what is the question?</P>\n","<P>23            MR. NICE:  And, Your Honour, if I may interrupt, if there's going</P>\n","<P>24    to be a reference to and quotation from a newspaper article, it has to be</P>\n","<P>25    on the overhead projector.

MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, since I have only one copy of these articles and I've</P>\n","<P> 6    just received that, could the usher please place them on the ELMO, and</P>\n","<P> 7    then you can have a look at least at some of the parts that have been</P>\n","<P> 8    marked.  Reference is made to Major Sljivancanin here, too, in a very</P>\n","<P> 9    favourable light.  Gratitude for assistance to civilians, Croats, at that,</P>\n","<P>10    and so on and so forth.  Please look at this series of articles.</P>\n","<P>11            In order to answer my question, are these at least partly articles</P>\n","<P>12    that you relied on when you wrote those submissions to the other side</P>\n","<P>13    about the untruthful testimony of Jovan Dulovic or, rather, the difference</P>\n","<P>14    in -- between his reporting then and his testimony here about Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>15            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, that was a leading but nevertheless it's</P>\n","<P>16    interesting to see what the articles actually say.

That is --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,</P>\n","<P> 7    because the overhead projector is not working.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further</P>\n","<P> 9    questions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except</P>\n","<P>10    for this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a</P>\n","<P>11    decision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were</P>\n","<P>12    presented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal</P>\n","<P>13    government said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was</P>\n","<P>14    known who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.</P>\n","<P>15    The 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.  So it is about</P>\n","<P>16    40 days after the coup d'etat of the 5th of October, 2000.  It was then</P>\n","<P>17    that they were all released, set free.</P>\n","<P>18            So wanted to show you this document, and I wanted to hand out</P>\n","<P>19    copies to you.  I've just received this.

It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of</P>\n","<P> 3    November.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   1991; right?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   1991.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Unless this is a leading question.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   It's illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one</P>\n","<P> 8    of the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when</P>\n","<P> 9    preparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.</P>\n","<P>10    That is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of</P>\n","<P>11    Evidence and Procedure.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the</P>\n","<P>13    subheading?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both</P>\n","<P>15    Serbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars</P>\n","<P>16    for a long time.  \"Light finally,\" is the heading.  And then in the</P>\n","<P>17    subheading:  \"Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas.\"  And then there's</P>\n","<P>18    another bit saying, \"In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,\"</P>\n","<P>19    and then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, \"I cannot believe</P>\n","<P>20    that we are alive,\" and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated</P>\n","<P>21    the town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.</P>\n","<P>22            THE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of</P>\n","<P>23    the question was not heard by the interpreters.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.  The interpreters have</P>\n","<P>25    indicated that you're overlapping and so she did not hear the beginning of</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43745 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    the last question.  Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P> 2            And please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.</P>\n","<P> 5    Perhaps it's easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text</P>\n","<P> 6    is.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as</P>\n","<P> 8    follows:  \"A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total</P>\n","<P> 9    of 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity.\"</P>\n","<P>10    That's what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and</P>\n","<P>11    Croats equally.  Civilians, that is.</P>\n","<P>12            I can't read the first paragraph because it's quite illegible, but</P>\n","<P>13    it seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,</P>\n","<P>14    that several ambulances were waiting to help.  \"It would not be a good</P>\n","<P>15    thing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now.\"</P>\n","<P>16            So Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of</P>\n","<P>17    Vukovar before the fighting had stopped.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Can you see the subtitle which says \"The cruel major\"?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this</P>\n","<P>21    refers to and what it says about this cruel major.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians</P>\n","<P>23    very nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that</P>\n","<P>24    surprised this Croat woman, and he says:  \"No knows what she as a Croat</P>\n","<P>25    heard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers.\"  So he's describing the</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43746 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    behaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what</P>\n","<P> 2    Croatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very</P>\n","<P> 3    bad way.</P>\n","<P> 4            And then Major Sljivancanin says:  \"Whenever you need anything,</P>\n","<P> 5    look for me and I'll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to</P>\n","<P> 6    go, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full</P>\n","<P> 7    of gratitude.\"  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  \"He had</P>\n","<P> 8    followed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude.\"</P>\n","<P> 9            All this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now</P>\n","<P>10    Colonel Veselin Sljivancanin.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic</P>\n","<P>12    describes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, \"Take this</P>\n","<P>13    child to hospital immediately.\"</P>\n","<P>14       A.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, \"Take this child to the</P>\n","<P>15    hospital in Negoslavci right away,\" Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing</P>\n","<P>16    the ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  \"Let her be given</P>\n","<P>17    assistance and medicine.\"</P>\n","<P>18            A little later Vlatka's mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for</P>\n","<P>19    her daughter in the crowd.  \"Where is my child?  What have they done to</P>\n","<P>20    her?  Where have they taken her,\" Verica was crying out.</P>\n","<P>21            \"Don't be afraid.  She is in hospital,\" Sljivancanin said.  The</P>\n","<P>22    frightened woman didn't believe it.\"  This is followed by Dulovic's</P>\n","<P>23    comment:  \"Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA</P>\n","<P>24    soldiers.\"</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   And what does it say then?</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43747 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   \"Get into my car.  I'll take you to the hospital so you can see</P>\n","<P> 2    your child and reassure yourself that everything is all right.  They both</P>\n","<P> 3    entered the vehicle.  In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and</P>\n","<P> 4    dressed Vlatka's wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the</P>\n","<P> 5    daughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them.\"</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   So this is Dulovic's report from the Vukovar war theatre.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on</P>\n","<P> 9    the following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points</P>\n","<P>10    are.  This large title, this heading, that is.</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.  Now it's been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a</P>\n","<P>12    statement, \"I believed in the army.\"  And what's in the subtitle.  \"A</P>\n","<P>13    little less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in</P>\n","<P>14    Vukovar.\"  And then there's a quotation.</P>\n","<P>15       A.   \"We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the</P>\n","<P>16    guards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the</P>\n","<P>17    hospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims.\"</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   And look what it says in the article.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the</P>\n","<P>20    following:  \"In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and</P>\n","<P>21    barricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house</P>\n","<P>22    number 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,</P>\n","<P>23    Milos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.  A few days</P>\n","<P>24    later, the members of the guards burst into the cellar.  These were</P>\n","<P>25    members of the Croatian National Guard Corps.  Get out or we'll throw a</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43748 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    bomb in.  The Chetniks are coming.  They're cutting everyone's throats.</P>\n","<P> 2    We're taking you to a shelter.\"</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   It's quite illegible.  Could you put some light on it?</P>\n","<P> 4            Look at the passages marked in yellow.  You don't have to read it</P>\n","<P> 5    all out, just a few passages.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.    \"Several of us -- or, rather, above us on the cemetery the guards</P>\n","<P> 7    members were stationed.  Milka Vidovic said, 'When they visited us in the</P>\n","<P> 8    cellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone's throats.  We</P>\n","<P> 9    Serbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the</P>\n","<P>10    only thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.  I</P>\n","<P>11    believed in our army and I believed they would arrive.'\"</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  What's the question in relation to this,</P>\n","<P>13    Mr. Milosevic?</P>\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what is the signature marked in yellow here?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   Jovan Dulovic.  The same Jovan Dulovic who four or five years</P>\n","<P>17    later changed his version by -- he turned around by 180 degrees because he</P>\n","<P>18    has become a mercenary of the Western intelligence services, and he writes</P>\n","<P>19    for the magazine Vreme which is the Belgrade branch of Western</P>\n","<P>20    intelligence agencies.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   Mr. Seselj, when you glanced through this article and you dealt</P>\n","<P>22    with it in your submission, is there a single word here which does not</P>\n","<P>23    speak favourably of the JNA and the people who fought in Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   No.  The texts are all exceptionally favourable, full of praise</P>\n","<P>25    for the soldiers and officers of the JNA during the fighting for Vukovar.</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43749 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   Would you look at the next page, please.  Let's just see what the</P>\n","<P> 2    date is.</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   The 18th, I suppose.  The 18th of November.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Well, move on.  Move on.</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Mr. Milosevic, Dulovic says here one day with volunteers and tank</P>\n","<P> 6    crews in the street fighting for the liberation of Vukovar.  He praises</P>\n","<P> 7    the volunteers who participated in the fighting for Vukovar as part of the</P>\n","<P> 8    JNA.  So this should be noted.</P>\n","<P> 9            Next page, please.  I think that it's very important to point this</P>\n","<P>10    out.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   And the signature is Jovan Dulovic.  What's the title of this</P>\n","<P>12    article?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   The title of this article is \"The Knights of Vukovar.\"</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   And who does it refer to?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   The units of Major Borivoje Tesic on the front line in Vukovar.</P>\n","<P>16    Major Borivoje Tesic I think -- says: \"I think this is the last stage of</P>\n","<P>17    the fighting.  Crews carrying out their tasks successfully and the help of</P>\n","<P>18    brave people is indispensable.\"  It speaks of Croatian Ustasha and so on.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic</P>\n","<P>22    said volunteers as part of JNA.  Could you show us the passage where</P>\n","<P>23    Mr. Dulovic said so?</P>\n","<P>24            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He says here:  \"One day with</P>\n","<P>25    volunteers and tank crews in the street fighting for the liberation of</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43750 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Vukovar.\"  This is above the headline.</P>\n","<P> 2            Then he goes on to say:  \"Speaking favourably of Stanko Vujanovic,</P>\n","<P> 3    he says the commander of the 1st Company of the Territorial Defence of</P>\n","<P> 4    Vukovar who is said to be a man who knows no fear.\" It's quite difficult</P>\n","<P> 5    to read this.  My eyesight is not so good and this is not very legible.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Can it be enlarged?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   \"With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making</P>\n","<P> 9    openings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze</P>\n","<P>10    through and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.  The house in</P>\n","<P>11    which they stopped in Prugomijska [phoen] Street near the Brdo cafe is</P>\n","<P>12    under constant fire by snipers whose positionings are very difficult to</P>\n","<P>13    discern.\"</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE KWON:  Now, Mr. Seselj, I would like see to see the passage</P>\n","<P>15    which shows that they were part of JNA as you indicated.  Or was it your</P>\n","<P>16    comment?</P>\n","<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  Please.  In the entire text the</P>\n","<P>18    volunteers are spoken of as members of the JNA.  We have passage here in</P>\n","<P>19    the third column where it says it's in the late afternoon and the fighting</P>\n","<P>20    is dying down.  The volunteers --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Could you use the pointer.  And you indicate on the</P>\n","<P>22    newspaper on the ELMO, not your monitor.  Yes.</P>\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] \"It's late in the afternoon and the</P>\n","<P>24    fighting is dying down.  The volunteers have pierced deep, and they have</P>\n","<P>25    conquered territory between the enemy forces.  The fighters will stay here</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43751 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    until the morning.  There were no casualties today except for one soldier</P>\n","<P> 2    who was killed, and his name was Vignjevic.\"</P>\n","<P> 3            He then says:  \"We are going back while shells are flying over our</P>\n","<P> 4    heads and Howitzer shells and so on.\"</P>\n","<P> 5            This whole text implies that the volunteers why part of the JNA.</P>\n","<P> 6    Mr. Kwon, you have here an order showing that these volunteers joined the</P>\n","<P> 7    1st Guards Brigade.  The order was delivered to the OTP from Belgrade and</P>\n","<P> 8    it's beyond dispute.</P>\n","<P> 9            In the Vukovar, there were no troops outside the JNA.  There were</P>\n","<P>10    no paramilitary units.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  It is your comment.  I really didn't see any</P>\n","<P>12    concrete -- the description these volunteers as part of JNA by</P>\n","<P>13    Mr. Dulovic.</P>\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have to read the whole text and</P>\n","<P>15    everything will become clear to you.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE KWON:  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Look at the next page, please.  The following text or this one</P>\n","<P>19    again says the Knights of Vukovar, Major Borivoje Tesic's units on the</P>\n","<P>20    front line, and this is a large article which seems not to be by Dulovic,</P>\n","<P>21    but on the left-hand side there is a small one:  \"Brave commander falls,</P>\n","<P>22    Borovo Selo.\"  Would you look at the signature?  I believe it's by</P>\n","<P>23    Dulovic.  Could you scroll up?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   What does it say in the passage marked by yellow?</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43752 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       A.   The initials \"JD\" mean Jovan Dulovic.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   And what does it say in this last passage?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- \"The inhabitants of the</P>\n","<P> 4    Crepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,</P>\n","<P> 5    who with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village</P>\n","<P> 6    and one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the</P>\n","<P> 7    highest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages.\"</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   And he was killed?</P>\n","<P> 9       A.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives</P>\n","<P>10    him.  Next page.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a</P>\n","<P>12    look?  I haven't had time to look at it all carefully.</P>\n","<P>13       A.   Yes.  There's a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of</P>\n","<P>14    November.  \"Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate</P>\n","<P>15    Vukovar.\"</P>\n","<P>16            In these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate</P>\n","<P>17    Vukovar, and five years later he's saying something completely different.</P>\n","<P>18             \"Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in</P>\n","<P>19    Vukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb.\"  And then it</P>\n","<P>20    says:  \"The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back,\" and so on</P>\n","<P>21    and so forth.</P>\n","<P>22            So this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the</P>\n","<P>23    JNA.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It's been circled.</P>\n","<P>25       A.   Yes.</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43753 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1       Q.   Very well.</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   The 4th of November, 1991.  \"For two days fierce fighting has not</P>\n","<P> 3    stopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in</P>\n","<P> 4    flames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of</P>\n","<P> 5    Njusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the</P>\n","<P> 6    Territorial Defence.  Advances by Territorial Defence units and volunteers</P>\n","<P> 7    from the direction of Trpinja stopped on the edge of Borovo Naselje.\"</P>\n","<P> 8            He then speaks of a Croatian mortar attack on Bobota [phoen] and</P>\n","<P> 9    so on.</P>\n","<P>10       Q.   Is this another report by Dulovic?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes, it's signed by Jovan Dulovic.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Is there anything else, any other report?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   I'm looking at another text here but I can't see whether it's by</P>\n","<P>14    Dulovic or not because it's not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian</P>\n","<P>15    volunteer guard but again a very favourable text.  I couldn't see -- I</P>\n","<P>16    can't see the name of the author here.  I can't see it on this page.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Is there anything else underneath, another report?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   \"Who are the volunteers,\" is the next title.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Well, I can't see anything anymore.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced</P>\n","<P>21    through the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is \"Through the holes</P>\n","<P>22    to the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>23    Unknown ammunition with inhumane bullets.\"</P>\n","<P>24            What happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used</P>\n","<P>25    weapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43754 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    because the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal</P>\n","<P> 2    organs.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I can't see what it says here in yellow, highlighted</P>\n","<P> 4    in yellow.</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It's Major Radic now</P>\n","<P> 6    who also stands accused in The Hague.  \"Throughout the month of October,</P>\n","<P> 7    the fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in</P>\n","<P> 8    the clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least</P>\n","<P> 9    one person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja</P>\n","<P>10    [phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in</P>\n","<P>11    that way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had</P>\n","<P>12    taken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.</P>\n","<P>13    The snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own</P>\n","<P>14    control and then a solution was found to move through the houses.\"</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic's article</P>\n","<P>16    again?</P>\n","<P>17       A.   Well, it's not legible but it is a series of articles by him.  We</P>\n","<P>18    can't find a signature here but quite obviously it is a series of articles</P>\n","<P>19    by him.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  Is that a series of articles to which you</P>\n","<P>21    referred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect</P>\n","<P>22    to Dulovic's testimony?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   Yes.  But this isn't the complete material.  My legal advisors</P>\n","<P>24    found many more texts of this kind and they quote them in extenso, and in</P>\n","<P>25    my submission I state my intention to disclose them in keeping with</P>\n","\n","\n","<CENTER><P><B> Page 43755 </B></P></CENTER>\n","<P> 1    Rule 67 of the rules of evidence.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, I have one more question</P>\n","<P> 3    [as interpreted] -- Robinson, I have a question for you.  As my associates</P>\n","<P> 4    have managed to come by a set of these or at least photocopies of the</P>\n","<P> 5    papers from 1991 which Mr. Seselj refers to in his submission to the other</P>\n","<P> 6    side, the presentation of these photocopies, is that sufficient grounds</P>\n","<P> 7    for my request that they be accepted as exhibits, that Mr. Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 8    submission be accepted as an exhibit?</P>\n","<P> 9            MR. NICE:  Rather interesting issues, I think, arise on the</P>\n","<P>10    validity of these documents as exhibits, and it may be necessary to go</P>\n","<P>11    back and remind ourselves of what Mr. Dulovic himself said about these</P>\n","<P>12    matters.  So I would respectfully invite the Chamber to put that matter</P>\n","<P>13    back.  But may we see the -- may we have access to this material tonight</P>\n","<P>14    in copy form in any event?

[Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some</P>\n","<P>22    questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian</P>\n","<P>23    indictment, that have to do with the \"Rump Presidency\" as it's called</P>\n","<P>24    here.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  \"The Rump Presidency</P>\n","<P>25    carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies,\" and so on and so forth, \"had</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    effect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief.\"</P>\n","<P> 2            I'm not going to ask you to repeat what you've already said, but</P>\n","<P> 3    in relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of</P>\n","<P> 4    Serbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they</P>\n","<P> 5    not take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency</P>\n","<P> 6    of the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any</P>\n","<P> 7    objective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from</P>\n","<P> 8    carrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?</P>\n","<P> 9            The question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,</P>\n","<P>10    Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the</P>\n","<P>11    SFRY Presidency in Belgrade?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,</P>\n","<P>13    staying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was</P>\n","<P>14    never a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from</P>\n","<P>15    carrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped</P>\n","<P>16    coming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had</P>\n","<P>17    practically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe</P>\n","<P>18    Mesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying</P>\n","<P>19    that they could not come because they could not strike a balance in</P>\n","<P>20    relation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and</P>\n","<P>21    Montenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.</P>\n","<P>22            The representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were</P>\n","<P>23    not expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was</P>\n","<P>24    actually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display</P>\n","<P>25    such feelings at the time.  It's only when he left Belgrade and when he</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    came back to the Croatian parliament that he said, \"I've completed my</P>\n","<P> 2    duty.  Yugoslavia is no more.\"</P>\n","<P> 3            He pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.</P>\n","<P> 4    Also, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him</P>\n","<P> 5    sufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he</P>\n","<P> 6    condemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most</P>\n","<P> 7    cooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was</P>\n","<P> 8    what he was.</P>\n","<P> 9            I already said that according to the constitution of the then</P>\n","<P>10    Yugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one</P>\n","<P>11    single member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been</P>\n","<P>12    prevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could</P>\n","<P>13    have gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could</P>\n","<P>14    have refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the</P>\n","<P>15    Presidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the</P>\n","<P>16    Presidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed</P>\n","<P>17    within the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably</P>\n","<P>18    before Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a</P>\n","<P>19    Rump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of</P>\n","<P>20    a rump Presidency.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  \"Slobodan Milosevic,</P>\n","<P>24    in his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that</P>\n","<P>25    Yugoslavia was finished.\"</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            Please, you've got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I'm not</P>\n","<P> 2    going to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much</P>\n","<P> 3    time.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to</P>\n","<P> 4    here or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that</P>\n","<P> 5    Yugoslavia was finished?</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say</P>\n","<P> 7    that Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you</P>\n","<P> 8    never said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I</P>\n","<P> 9    remember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the</P>\n","<P>10    behaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went</P>\n","<P>11    through a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,</P>\n","<P>12    constitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,</P>\n","<P>13    but then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional</P>\n","<P>14    provision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases</P>\n","<P>15    to exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the</P>\n","<P>16    matter.</P>\n","<P>17            The leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never</P>\n","<P>18    did it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and</P>\n","<P>19    Croatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and</P>\n","<P>20    Macedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro</P>\n","<P>21    proclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting</P>\n","<P>22    of two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration</P>\n","<P>23    on your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   \"In March 1991 the collective Presidency of the SFRY reached a</P>\n","<P> 2    deadlock on several issues.\"  That is paragraph 56.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... that sentence</P>\n","<P> 4    which is at the beginning of the paragraph.  There's another allegation in</P>\n","<P> 5    that last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no</P>\n","<P> 6    longer be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask</P>\n","<P> 7    Mr. Seselj whether that is so.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember</P>\n","<P> 9    at that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian</P>\n","<P>10    public, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the</P>\n","<P>11    decisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that</P>\n","<P>12    Serbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation</P>\n","<P>13    when the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.</P>\n","<P>14            I would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there</P>\n","<P>15    was a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the</P>\n","<P>16    headquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long</P>\n","<P>17    debate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the</P>\n","<P>18    demand of the military to declare a state of emergency.</P>\n","<P>19            The top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the</P>\n","<P>20    behaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a</P>\n","<P>21    vote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.  As far as I can</P>\n","<P>22    remember --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You have answered the question I asked, thanks.</P>\n","<P>24            Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   That is what is referred to here.  It says the representatives on</P>\n","<P> 2    the Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,</P>\n","<P> 3    the autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of</P>\n","<P> 4    Kosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what</P>\n","<P> 5    was so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the</P>\n","<P> 6    Presidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also</P>\n","<P> 8    start the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven't got the document here</P>\n","<P> 9    so I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were</P>\n","<P>10    actually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already</P>\n","<P>11    started putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the</P>\n","<P>12    Presidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the</P>\n","<P>13    Presidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not</P>\n","<P>14    very constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the</P>\n","<P>15    Presidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,</P>\n","<P>16    or Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.</P>\n","<P>17    I think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been</P>\n","<P>18    recalled in the meantime.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that</P>\n","<P>20    session or before that session or in relation to that session I never</P>\n","<P>21    declared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did</P>\n","<P>22    they declare that Yugoslavia was finished?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   I've already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian</P>\n","<P>24    politicians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was</P>\n","<P>25    one of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    hard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.</P>\n","<P> 2            As for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in</P>\n","<P> 3    Montenegro either.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to</P>\n","<P> 5    normal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic</P>\n","<P> 6    was elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented</P>\n","<P> 7    Vojvodina at the time.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the</P>\n","<P> 9    Presidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started</P>\n","<P>10    working again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its</P>\n","<P>11    work.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of</P>\n","<P>12    Bosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil</P>\n","<P>13    Tupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new</P>\n","<P>14    crisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be</P>\n","<P>15    elected president of the Presidency.</P>\n","<P>16            There was a principle involved that the president of the</P>\n","<P>17    Presidency was elected from a different republican province every year but</P>\n","<P>18    nobody's election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic</P>\n","<P>19    did not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European</P>\n","<P>20    envoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to</P>\n","<P>21    elect him nevertheless.</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting</P>\n","<P>24    the preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from</P>\n","<P>25    those positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says</P>\n","<P> 2    that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and</P>\n","<P> 3    discussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between</P>\n","<P> 4    Serbia and Croatia?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I</P>\n","<P> 6    remember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what</P>\n","<P> 7    was skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching</P>\n","<P> 8    agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the</P>\n","<P> 9    Bosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a</P>\n","<P>10    situation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it</P>\n","<P>11    increasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the</P>\n","<P>12    country at the time.</P>\n","<P>13            At that time, I -- as I've already said, the presidents of the</P>\n","<P>14    presidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys</P>\n","<P>15    had actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach</P>\n","<P>16    agreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia</P>\n","<P>17    increasingly so.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through</P>\n","<P>19    what medium?</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully</P>\n","<P>21    being bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media</P>\n","<P>22    this kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were</P>\n","<P>23    already at that time being financed from the West by different Western</P>\n","<P>24    intelligence agencies, so that's the kind of media I'm talking about.  In</P>\n","<P>25    Belgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    federal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic</P>\n","<P> 2    government, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government</P>\n","<P> 3    in Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the</P>\n","<P> 4    Western powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante</P>\n","<P> 5    Markovic's government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible</P>\n","<P> 6    agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 7    together under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been</P>\n","<P> 8    eliminated.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at</P>\n","<P>12    one stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence</P>\n","<P>13    counsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest</P>\n","<P>14    collaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This</P>\n","<P>15    denies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of</P>\n","<P>16    Bosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted</P>\n","<P>17    into evidence and if not we will find this transcript.</P>\n","<P>18            However, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with</P>\n","<P>19    you as you were an active participant in all political events.  This</P>\n","<P>20    meeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the</P>\n","<P>21    division of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any</P>\n","<P>22    member of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning</P>\n","<P>23    of which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way</P>\n","<P>24    even indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    if Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 2    as an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as</P>\n","<P> 3    a constituent nation as they had been before in the previous</P>\n","<P> 4    constitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the</P>\n","<P> 5    first president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it</P>\n","<P> 6    was not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint</P>\n","<P> 7    state.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans</P>\n","<P> 8    persuaded him to call off the agreement.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It</P>\n","<P>10    says:  \"On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY</P>\n","<P>11    Presidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,</P>\n","<P>12    Sejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY</P>\n","<P>13    Presidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the</P>\n","<P>14    Presidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and</P>\n","<P>15    Macedonia.\"</P>\n","<P>16            On the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.  Was this</P>\n","<P>17    a kind of takeover of the function of the Presidency or were these</P>\n","<P>18    functions being carried out by the legal representatives?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   There was absolutely no takeover.  When four of the members of the</P>\n","<P>20    Presidency withdrew and some of them officially gave notice that they were</P>\n","<P>21    no longer members, like Drnovsek, for instance, while others simply</P>\n","<P>22    stopped attending the sessions.  The Presidency continued working with the</P>\n","<P>23    members who -- whom it was possible to gather together.</P>\n","<P>24            I suggest that the Chamber get hold of this piece of legislation.</P>\n","<P>25    I cannot quote it verbatim right now, but I'm absolutely sure it existed.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    And according to this piece of legislation, even if the majority of</P>\n","<P> 2    members could not meet, the Presidency under certain circumstances would</P>\n","<P> 3    continue working with the members who were present.</P>\n","<P> 4            Let me remind you that in the spring of 1991 or in the early</P>\n","<P> 5    summer, there was a vote taken to declare a imminent threat of war.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 65 it says:  \"On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,</P>\n","<P> 7    Slobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal</P>\n","<P> 8    enterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from</P>\n","<P> 9    Belgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the</P>\n","<P>10    mobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay</P>\n","<P>11    in Yugoslavia.\"</P>\n","<P>12            First of all, let's establish when I began advocating a unitary</P>\n","<P>13    Serb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And</P>\n","<P>14    secondly, was this anyone's idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,</P>\n","<P>15    and is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever</P>\n","<P>16    been a unitary state?</P>\n","<P>17       A.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as</P>\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally</P>\n","<P>19    and your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt</P>\n","<P>20    the new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the</P>\n","<P>21    autonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the</P>\n","<P>22    Serb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of</P>\n","<P>23    autonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an</P>\n","<P>24    option.</P>\n","<P>25            Furthermore, when the four former federal units had already been</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    recognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the</P>\n","<P> 2    Montenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be</P>\n","<P> 3    promulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump</P>\n","<P> 4    Yugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would</P>\n","<P> 5    have been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -</P>\n","<P> 6    because that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary</P>\n","<P> 7    Serbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this</P>\n","<P> 8    but didn't want to, and I am sorry that you didn't do that, because up to</P>\n","<P> 9    the point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --</P>\n","<P>10    in Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It</P>\n","<P>11    appeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any</P>\n","<P>13    of my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who</P>\n","<P>14    were allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had</P>\n","<P>15    any kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated</P>\n","<P>17    with you advocated such an idea.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it</P>\n","<P>19    says here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of</P>\n","<P>20    reservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the</P>\n","<P>21    reasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was</P>\n","<P>22    called for?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   I'm not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation</P>\n","<P>24    of reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to</P>\n","<P>25    mobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    to take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the</P>\n","<P> 2    territorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that</P>\n","<P> 3    this mobilisation didn't go well.  The response was very poor, because</P>\n","<P> 4    Veljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn't want to remove the</P>\n","<P> 5    communist insignia from the military uniforms.</P>\n","<P> 6            The Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the</P>\n","<P> 7    Presidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was</P>\n","<P> 8    Prime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in</P>\n","<P> 9    Slovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of</P>\n","<P>10    such an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops</P>\n","<P>11    into Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then</P>\n","<P>12    leadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as</P>\n","<P>13    I know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership</P>\n","<P>14    which had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your</P>\n","<P>16    name, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask</P>\n","<P>17    you now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of</P>\n","<P>18    April, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan's and</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you</P>\n","<P>20    know anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and</P>\n","<P>21    cart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of</P>\n","<P>22    cooperation with Arkan's volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>24    did not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert</P>\n","<P>25    that, I'm saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    organised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as</P>\n","<P> 2    much as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.</P>\n","<P> 3    That's a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P> 4    Radical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty</P>\n","<P> 5    to Serbia.  I guarantee that.</P>\n","<P> 6            The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict</P>\n","<P> 7    instructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb</P>\n","<P> 8    volunteer guard up to the --</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm asking why was that instruction given to the</P>\n","<P>10    volunteers of the Serb Radical Party?</P>\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.</P>\n","<P>12    We didn't want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn't</P>\n","<P>13    want people's awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.</P>\n","<P>14            As I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,</P>\n","<P>15    long before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had</P>\n","<P>16    quarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was</P>\n","<P>17    in danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this</P>\n","<P>18    in the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding</P>\n","<P>20    that instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with</P>\n","<P>21    Arkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You're</P>\n","<P>22    not there with them.</P>\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can't say that not a single</P>\n","<P>24    volunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There's one</P>\n","<P>25    instance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    teacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 2    Party.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of</P>\n","<P> 3    about 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back</P>\n","<P> 4    but, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of</P>\n","<P> 5    Arkan's men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.</P>\n","<P> 6            So, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint</P>\n","<P> 7    military activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with</P>\n","<P> 8    Arkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a</P>\n","<P> 9    distance from Arkan.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.</P>\n","<P>11            Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on</P>\n","<P>14    transcript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia</P>\n","<P>15    took place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj's</P>\n","<P>16    White Eagles.</P>\n","<P>17            First of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and</P>\n","<P>18    secondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj's White Eagles?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb</P>\n","<P>20    people organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have</P>\n","<P>21    already said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of</P>\n","<P>22    volunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After</P>\n","<P>23    that, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we</P>\n","<P>24    had volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never</P>\n","<P>25    had anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            There was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo</P>\n","<P> 2    Selo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he</P>\n","<P> 3    was killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not</P>\n","<P> 4    carrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no</P>\n","<P> 5    joint military activities.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Let's clarify this.  It doesn't say here that you cooperated.  It</P>\n","<P> 7    says here:  \"With infiltration of Seselj's White Eagles.\"  So the White</P>\n","<P> 8    Eagles are being ascribed to you.</P>\n","<P> 9       A.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the</P>\n","<P>10    Prosecutor bringing witnesses here who don't no anything about what</P>\n","<P>11    happened on the ground.  It's simply nonsense to talk of a group called</P>\n","<P>12    Seselj's White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and</P>\n","<P>13    the Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn't know</P>\n","<P>14    what he was talking about.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,</P>\n","<P>16    2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that \"Seselj collected men in</P>\n","<P>17    Erdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia.\"  Is that</P>\n","<P>18    true, Mr. Seselj?</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493</P>\n","<P>20    who testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake</P>\n","<P>22    in my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that</P>\n","<P>23    particular page, and the page is 19003.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    them to Bosnia?</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in</P>\n","<P> 3    Erdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,</P>\n","<P> 4    nicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only</P>\n","<P> 5    time.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --</P>\n","<P> 6    we never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there</P>\n","<P> 7    either, and I can state that quite categorically.</P>\n","<P> 8            The people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the</P>\n","<P> 9    war and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were</P>\n","<P>10    exclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I</P>\n","<P>11    absolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan's centre in Erdut</P>\n","<P>12    later on.  We never had anything to do with it.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is</P>\n","<P>14    20294, says that Arkan's and Seselj's men shot above the heads of the</P>\n","<P>15    civilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in</P>\n","<P>16    Bratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who</P>\n","<P>17    mistreated and abused the civilians?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian</P>\n","<P>19    Radical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my</P>\n","<P>20    knowledge Arkan didn't appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in</P>\n","<P>21    Zvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in</P>\n","<P>22    Bratunac either.  And I've already said that in Bratunac there was</P>\n","<P>23    Deronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there</P>\n","<P>24    I was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have</P>\n","<P>25    very certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj's men were</P>\n","<P> 2    in Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 3    mean there is no difference, says he.</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can't see any</P>\n","<P> 5    difference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the</P>\n","<P> 6    White Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at</P>\n","<P> 7    all.  And that's not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some</P>\n","<P> 8    judgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to</P>\n","<P> 9    see in some other places Seselj's White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the</P>\n","<P>10    problem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses</P>\n","<P>11    which it manipulates.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on</P>\n","<P>13    several occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --</P>\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven't been able to check this myself</P>\n","<P>15    because the accused hasn't been getting the references correct, and it's</P>\n","<P>16    quite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I'm grateful to</P>\n","<P>17    Ms. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came</P>\n","<P>18    (redacted).</P>\n","<P>19    But, really, I'm afraid we've got to have correct references for the</P>\n","<P>20    witnesses.  We can't simply just go to the page in the transcript.</P>\n","<P>21    Frequently our page numbers don't necessarily coincide here in court, and</P>\n","<P>22    without reference to the witnesses it's very difficult to pick it up</P>\n","<P>23    later.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in</P>\n","<P>25    pinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you're referring.  Now,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Judge Kwon has already corrected you once, and apparently there is another</P>\n","<P> 2    mistake in the reference.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, perhaps there might be a</P>\n","<P> 4    mistake with the name, but there is no mistake with the quotation from the</P>\n","<P> 5    transcript, and my question relates to the material facts which are being</P>\n","<P> 6    mentioned here.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, we have to follow it, Mr. Milosevic.  There</P>\n","<P> 8    is duty on you to be more careful.</P>\n","<P> 9            Please proceed.</P>\n","<P>10            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. Robinson.  And I'll</P>\n","<P>11    check this out to see whether indeed it is the same witness from</P>\n","<P>12    page 20352, the transcript line and page, the quotation that I mentioned</P>\n","<P>13    earlier on or, rather, 20351 is the exact number.  I'll check that out</P>\n","<P>14    during the break.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript</P>\n","<P>17    said that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of</P>\n","<P>18    March, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan's men took part as well as</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the</P>\n","<P>20    occupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on</P>\n","<P>21    the 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of</P>\n","<P>22    your volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What</P>\n","<P>24    happened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between</P>\n","<P>25    the JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Muslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.</P>\n","<P> 2    However, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went</P>\n","<P> 3    on for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting</P>\n","<P> 4    the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was</P>\n","<P> 5    there, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my</P>\n","<P> 6    knowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of</P>\n","<P> 7    the local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to</P>\n","<P> 8    establish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the</P>\n","<P> 9    ground there.</P>\n","<P>10            I know -- have reliable information that the commands and the</P>\n","<P>11    officers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan's and</P>\n","<P>12    the Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a</P>\n","<P>13    great deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very</P>\n","<P>14    rarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.</P>\n","<P>15            As far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,</P>\n","<P>16    over there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did</P>\n","<P>17    appear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the</P>\n","<P>18    call of Biljana Plavsic.  I can't prove that, but I do know that Biljana</P>\n","<P>19    Plavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly</P>\n","<P>20    meeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The</P>\n","<P>21    volunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina</P>\n","<P>22    were not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the</P>\n","<P>23    Serbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were</P>\n","<P>24    residents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the</P>\n","<P>25    conflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    and Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan's right-hand man.  And in</P>\n","<P> 2    Serbia we didn't send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something</P>\n","<P> 4    for me in relation to the Prosecution's case.  In the Bosnia indictment</P>\n","<P> 5    the allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other</P>\n","<P> 6    members of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the</P>\n","<P> 7    Prosecution case unfolded, you're not saying, are you, that he acted</P>\n","<P> 8    alone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with</P>\n","<P> 9    other members of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven't reviewed each and every allegation</P>\n","<P>11    to check that there isn't one there that may be susceptible to individual</P>\n","<P>12    perpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he's working with others.</P>\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually</P>\n","<P>16    your case.  It's not that he acted alone.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. NICE:  Subject to the point I've just made.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you've made, yes.</P>\n","<P>19            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Very well, Mr. Seselj.  You've just heard that explanation too.</P>\n","<P>23    Now, since you know the relationships very well between people at that</P>\n","<P>24    time, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and</P>\n","<P>25    Zvornik yourself.  Now, did I or any organs of power and authority have</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    anything to do with Arkan's volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and</P>\n","<P> 4    I think perhaps there's this qualification, although I don't think it is a</P>\n","<P> 5    qualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this</P>\n","<P> 6    accused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top</P>\n","<P> 7    political level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are</P>\n","<P> 8    criminal in nature.  It's the standard method of generation of</P>\n","<P> 9    genocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar</P>\n","<P>10    [phoen].</P>\n","<P>11            Now, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other</P>\n","<P>12    people.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may</P>\n","<P>13    be minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in</P>\n","<P>14    those circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting</P>\n","<P>15    alone in certain circumstances, but that's the only qualification I think</P>\n","<P>16    I should make.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it's a point that will warrant some</P>\n","<P>18    consideration later on, yes.</P>\n","<P>19            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>20            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   So Arkan is mentioned here as well as Mauzer.  Did I or anybody</P>\n","<P>22    else from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all</P>\n","<P>23    and with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   I'm quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.</P>\n","<P>25    On the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    contacts with Arkan.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many</P>\n","<P> 3    questions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the</P>\n","<P> 4    evidence he's giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,</P>\n","<P> 5    how is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan</P>\n","<P> 6    or Mauzer?</P>\n","<P> 7            He's giving evidence.  He's saying that you had nothing to do with</P>\n","<P> 8    him.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to</P>\n","<P> 9    establish how he's in a position to make that statement.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that</P>\n","<P>12    cannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from</P>\n","<P>13    the authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or</P>\n","<P>14    relationship with Arkan or Mauzer?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   In Belgrade you couldn't hide anything like that.  It would be</P>\n","<P>16    impossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is</P>\n","<P>17    that kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become</P>\n","<P>18    public.</P>\n","<P>19            Second, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts</P>\n","<P>20    only with Zoran Djindjic.  And I've already spoken about the relationship</P>\n","<P>21    between Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic's vice-president and the</P>\n","<P>22    president of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his</P>\n","<P>23    pre-electoral campaign.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   Let's clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did</P>\n","<P>25    you have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    able to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in</P>\n","<P> 2    Bijeljina?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina</P>\n","<P> 4    sufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,</P>\n","<P> 5    including Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this</P>\n","<P> 6    trial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events</P>\n","<P> 7    that went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in</P>\n","<P> 8    Bijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements</P>\n","<P> 9    and held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and</P>\n","<P>10    severely criticised Mauzer's conduct, especially Mauzer's conduct towards</P>\n","<P>11    the Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am</P>\n","<P>12    preparing them for my own trial, which doesn't seem to be starting.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack</P>\n","<P>14    on the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the</P>\n","<P>15    JNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by</P>\n","<P>16    the Red Berets or, rather, Arkan's and Seselj's men.  So that's the</P>\n","<P>17    quotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan's</P>\n","<P>18    and Seselj's men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red</P>\n","<P>19    Berets were they?  What Arkan's men were they, Seselj's men were they</P>\n","<P>20    around Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the</P>\n","<P>22    witness don't seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened</P>\n","<P>23    to see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red</P>\n","<P>24    cap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.</P>\n","<P>25    And then he -- the witness doesn't know whether they were Seselj's men or</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Arkan's men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it's</P>\n","<P> 2    highly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of</P>\n","<P> 3    his head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify</P>\n","<P> 4    so-called Seselj's men and Arkan's men and these alleged Red Berets.</P>\n","<P> 5            As for the Red Berets, I've already given you reliable facts about</P>\n","<P> 6    them and said that name appeared in different situations relating to</P>\n","<P> 7    different military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina</P>\n","<P> 8    area where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then</P>\n","<P> 9    the army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of</P>\n","<P>10    the intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until</P>\n","<P>11    the special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of</P>\n","<P>12    Serbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this</P>\n","<P>13    misunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed</P>\n","<P>14    to people with -- which they had nothing to do with.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the</P>\n","<P>16    following:  \"Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P>17    who were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done.\"</P>\n","<P>18    That's when this witness claims.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He's a colonel by</P>\n","<P>20    rank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff</P>\n","<P>21    of the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the</P>\n","<P>22    number two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that's the same</P>\n","<P>23    Osman Selak that you're referring to.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   Well, I can't tell you that.</P>\n","<P>25       A.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a</P>\n","<P> 2    statement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,</P>\n","<P> 3    what the circumstances were in which I said it.</P>\n","<P> 4            I did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the</P>\n","<P> 5    secession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia</P>\n","<P> 6    seceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,</P>\n","<P> 7    and for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he</P>\n","<P> 8    personally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.</P>\n","<P> 9            As far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from</P>\n","<P>10    Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of</P>\n","<P>11    Yugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and</P>\n","<P>12    Raska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of</P>\n","<P>13    examples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army</P>\n","<P>14    perform their duty very honourably.</P>\n","<P>15            So the citizens --</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are</P>\n","<P>18    saying that you did make such a statement or you didn't make such a</P>\n","<P>19    statement.</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if</P>\n","<P>21    you don't show me something like that here, where and when.  Let us see</P>\n","<P>22    the statement concerned.  Let me identify it.  I gave thousands and</P>\n","<P>23    thousands of statements in public.  They were publicly recorded.  They</P>\n","<P>24    were published.  So let's see.</P>\n","<P>25            My objection is precisely in that.  Why did this Osman Selak not</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    say where and when?</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's helpful to some extent.  Does it follow from</P>\n","<P> 3    the answer you've just given that you could have said it?</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I could have said it along the</P>\n","<P> 5    following lines, that those in the army who came from the renegade</P>\n","<P> 6    republics in principle should not remain at positions in the Yugoslav</P>\n","<P> 7    army.  You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live</P>\n","<P> 8    in Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in</P>\n","<P> 9    the army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as</P>\n","<P>10    officers?</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's simply confusing me further.  The quote was</P>\n","<P>12    that you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims</P>\n","<P>13    and Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that</P>\n","<P>14    you could possibly have made that statement in these terms?</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not saying that I made that kind</P>\n","<P>16    of statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak</P>\n","<P>17    testified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise</P>\n","<P>18    lines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman</P>\n","<P>19    Selak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be</P>\n","<P>20    established.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the</P>\n","<P>21    Prosecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly</P>\n","<P>22    what I said.</P>\n","<P>23            I am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,</P>\n","<P>24    but it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you're asking me to do is</P>\n","<P>25    to comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Selak's view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make</P>\n","<P> 2    my statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm</P>\n","<P> 4    trying to understand the answer you've given to the question asked by</P>\n","<P> 5    Mr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you've just said, the problem is</P>\n","<P> 6    that you've been studying this yourself, and you're trying to justify a</P>\n","<P> 7    position of your own without really dealing specifically with the question</P>\n","<P> 8    that's being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears</P>\n","<P> 9    now to be that you couldn't possibly have made a statement of that nature,</P>\n","<P>10    although you might have said something much more specific about different</P>\n","<P>11    people but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.</P>\n","<P>12            Now, is that a fair summary of your position?</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I'm not sure, by think you're</P>\n","<P>14    very close.  However, in order to help you, I'm going to give you an</P>\n","<P>15    example.</P>\n","<P>16            Throughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were</P>\n","<P>17    informed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,</P>\n","<P>18    escaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of</P>\n","<P>19    confidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998</P>\n","<P>20    we had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of</P>\n","<P>21    the military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his</P>\n","<P>22    family abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives</P>\n","<P>23    there.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn't remotely sound as if it's</P>\n","<P>25    going to be at all helpful to me, so we'll proceed with Mr. Milosevic's</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    questions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you</P>\n","<P> 2    was about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist</P>\n","<P> 3    statement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple</P>\n","<P> 4    issue I'm not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further</P>\n","<P> 5    if he wishes.</P>\n","<P> 6            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in</P>\n","<P>11    no uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that</P>\n","<P>12    any statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never</P>\n","<P>13    in my life have I made a racist statement.</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>\n","<P>19            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  There's nothing for you to respond to.</P>\n","<P>21            Mr. Milosevic, the next question.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I'm afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I</P>\n","<P>24    put a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific</P>\n","<P>25    terms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    here that \"Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 2    who were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed.\"  Did you ever state</P>\n","<P> 3    that?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I didn't say it that way.</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   So you didn't say it that way --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... matter.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  And why on earth it should take all this time to</P>\n","<P> 8    establish that simple issue, I do not know.</P>\n","<P> 9            Perhaps it would help, Mr. Seselj, if you just listened to the</P>\n","<P>10    questions and answer the question that's actually asked rather than try to</P>\n","<P>11    make political statements about your own position.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic --</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not making political statements,</P>\n","<P>14    Mr. Bonomy.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He</P>\n","<P>17    mentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether</P>\n","<P>18    those facts are correct.  And first of all, I'm interested in the</P>\n","<P>19    circumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  \"Just after</P>\n","<P>20    the bombing Seselj came to Pale.\"  And then on page 26762 he</P>\n","<P>21    says:  \"Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to</P>\n","<P>22    support the Bosnian Serbs.\"  These are a few facts that referred to.</P>\n","<P>23    Could you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this</P>\n","<P>24    actually all about?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the</P>\n","<P> 2    leadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly</P>\n","<P> 3    engaged in an anti-Serb policy.</P>\n","<P> 4            As for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market</P>\n","<P> 5    itself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the</P>\n","<P> 6    street of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these</P>\n","<P> 7    are explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of</P>\n","<P> 8    whether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar</P>\n","<P> 9    shells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.</P>\n","<P>10            This was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the</P>\n","<P>11    Serbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the</P>\n","<P>12    threats that were made, and so on and so forth.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there</P>\n","<P>14    you did so only to give political support to the leadership of</P>\n","<P>15    Republika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and</P>\n","<P>16    bombing.</P>\n","<P>17       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  \"In January or February</P>\n","<P>19    1992\" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, \"Arkan's</P>\n","<P>20    and Seselj's units arrived in Doboj.\"</P>\n","<P>21            Is this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?</P>\n","<P>22       A.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,</P>\n","<P>23    there were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.</P>\n","<P>24            Secondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to</P>\n","<P>25    Doboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan's Tigers never</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    operated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to</P>\n","<P> 3    this question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript page 27738, quite explicitly, \"Mirko Blagojevic,\" that is to</P>\n","<P> 5    say, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he</P>\n","<P> 6    says:  \"Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,</P>\n","<P> 7    and he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with</P>\n","<P> 8    Seselj.\"</P>\n","<P> 9            I am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>10    Party or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that</P>\n","<P>11    Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So</P>\n","<P>12    please deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the</P>\n","<P>13    transcript.  Is it correct or not?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is</P>\n","<P>15    organised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A</P>\n","<P>16    conflict occurs when two armed formations clash.</P>\n","<P>17            Mirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in</P>\n","<P>18    Bijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim</P>\n","<P>19    formations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any</P>\n","<P>20    conflicts.  And I guarantee with my own life that he took part in no</P>\n","<P>21    looting, no persecutions, no maltreatment of the civilian population and</P>\n","<P>22    so on and so forth.  I'm absolutely certain of that.</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Thank you.</P>\n","<P>24       A.   I can fully identify with everything that Mirko Blagojevic did.</P>\n","<P>25    It is to that degree that I'm certain that he never did anything against</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the law.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  \"Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 3    men tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm.\"</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   My understanding is it's somewhere near Zvornik.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   That's quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 7    Party took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there</P>\n","<P> 8    in brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on</P>\n","<P> 9    for a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the</P>\n","<P>10    Muslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to</P>\n","<P>11    an end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>12    withdrew.</P>\n","<P>13            I preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on</P>\n","<P>14    guarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing</P>\n","<P>15    happened, I would have had to know about it.</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you</P>\n","<P>17    personally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following</P>\n","<P>18    circumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  \"Seselj,</P>\n","<P>19    on Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired</P>\n","<P>20    it at Muslims in Sarajevo.\"  This was shown on television, and he said</P>\n","<P>21    that you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at</P>\n","<P>23    Grbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called</P>\n","<P>24    international observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go</P>\n","<P>25    around the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Serb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was</P>\n","<P> 2    an apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I</P>\n","<P> 3    used a Browning machine-gun from there.  It's a heavy machine-gun.  I</P>\n","<P> 4    couldn't carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry</P>\n","<P> 5    it around.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   You cannot carry it.  It's too long.  It was installed in that</P>\n","<P> 8    building, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches</P>\n","<P> 9    below the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of</P>\n","<P>10    the volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was</P>\n","<P>11    firing from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and</P>\n","<P>12    the top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is</P>\n","<P>13    something I don't know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who</P>\n","<P>14    could have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this</P>\n","<P>15    small participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.</P>\n","<P>16            A Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that</P>\n","<P>17    case, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been</P>\n","<P>18    forced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of</P>\n","<P>19    those who in violation of international law of war brought him out there</P>\n","<P>20    to dig trenches, not those who --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,</P>\n","<P>24    that at the beginning of April Seselj's men arrived in the area of</P>\n","<P>25    Bratunac and Zvornik.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic's part.  He knows</P>\n","<P> 2    full well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing</P>\n","<P> 3    who he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and</P>\n","<P> 4    making this sweeping statement Seselj's men arrived in Bratunac and</P>\n","<P> 5    Zvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it's as if they were in Bratunac</P>\n","<P> 6    too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so</P>\n","<P> 7    Deronjic invented that.</P>\n","<P> 8            In Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the</P>\n","<P> 9    Bratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was</P>\n","<P>10    commander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he</P>\n","<P>11    was not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,</P>\n","<P>12    then a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.  I think the interpreter is having</P>\n","<P>14    some difficulty.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will.</P>\n","<P>16            You could have noticed, Mr. Robinson, that I have been trying as</P>\n","<P>17    of late to speak slowly, but sometimes, every now and then, I may forget</P>\n","<P>18    what you cautioned me about.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, I had noticed, and the -- we are</P>\n","<P>20    appreciative of the effort you are making.  You have answered the</P>\n","<P>21    question.</P>\n","<P>22            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the meantime --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think you have answered that question.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   So they were not in Bratunac at all?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in</P>\n","<P> 2    Bratunac.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   All right.  So you are saying that he's not telling the truth.</P>\n","<P> 4            The same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not</P>\n","<P> 5    agree that Seselj was a true opposition.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   The Hague OTP and Judge Schomburg on several occasions caught</P>\n","<P> 7    Deronjic lying.  And even in Deronjic's judgement you can find about seven</P>\n","<P> 8    different points as ascertained by Judge Schomburg, namely that Deronjic</P>\n","<P> 9    was lying.</P>\n","<P>10            Secondly, in the case of people who are inclined to a pro-Western</P>\n","<P>11    policy or are mercenaries of Western intelligence agencies, or in order to</P>\n","<P>12    save their own skin they go into plea bargaining with the OTP and</P>\n","<P>13    therefore appear as witnesses in the trials of other people, it can often</P>\n","<P>14    be heard that those who are really opposition but are not prepared to</P>\n","<P>15    serve the West --</P>\n","<P>16            MR.

NICE:  He was simply asked if the man was telling the truth.</P>\n","<P>21    We have his answer and he's now gone on to a long comment basically.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, you have moved into the area of comment.</P>\n","<P>23            It's now time for the break.</P>\n","<P>24            Mr. Nice, I should say the question that I asked earlier related</P>\n","<P>25    to the Bosnia indictment.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            We will break for 20 minutes.</P>\n","<P> 2                          --- Recess taken at 3.41 p.m.</P>\n","<P> 3                          --- On resuming at 4.08 p.m.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, you told me to check</P>\n","<P> 6    the pages that Mr. Nice mentioned, 35 -- 20352 and 20351, that is.  This</P>\n","<P> 7    was Witness 1070.</P>\n","<P> 8            On page 20351 he says that Seselj's men were in Bratunac and that</P>\n","<P> 9    there was no difference between them and Seselj's men, the White Eagles,</P>\n","<P>10    that is.</P>\n","<P>11            And on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April</P>\n","<P>12    Seselj's and Arkan's men were in Bratunac together when some people were</P>\n","<P>13    deported.  And Mr. Seselj answered questions about this.  In the meantime,</P>\n","<P>14    the liaison officer had the transcript, and I have received a note saying</P>\n","<P>15    that both references are correct, both as regards page 20351 and 20352,</P>\n","<P>16    and these refer to Witness 1070.  There was no error.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  All right, Mr. Milosevic.  We'll do our own</P>\n","<P>18    check.  Thank you for checking anyhow.</P>\n","<P>19            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   Mr. Seselj, this is the testimony of Miroslav Deronjic, who said</P>\n","<P>21    that you were not truly an opposition politician or, rather, that you</P>\n","<P>22    cooperated with the government and that therefore this idea of a joint</P>\n","<P>23    criminal enterprise is thereby confirmed.  Were you in the opposition or</P>\n","<P>24    not?</P>\n","<P>25            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it</P>\n","<P> 2    on.</P>\n","<P> 3            Both the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time</P>\n","<P> 4    were distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as</P>\n","<P> 5    it's possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by</P>\n","<P> 6    Deronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the</P>\n","<P> 7    opposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint</P>\n","<P> 8    often expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various</P>\n","<P> 9    government and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person</P>\n","<P>10    of the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or</P>\n","<P>11    Miles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery</P>\n","<P>12    and so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while</P>\n","<P>13    criticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition</P>\n","<P>14    politicians, and this logic is completely upside down.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Witness Ahmet Zulic says, and that's on page 30000 of the</P>\n","<P>17    transcript, he says that Seselj's men were stationed in the partisan</P>\n","<P>18    cemetery in Pobrezje, that doesn't matter so much but what matters is the</P>\n","<P>19    following, that they had come there to kill the Muslims.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Where is this place?  Pobrezje?  Where is it?</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   I have a note here in Pobrezje.  I can't be more specific than</P>\n","<P>22    that.</P>\n","<P>23            But let me put a question to you:  Did your volunteers go anywhere</P>\n","<P>24    to kill all Muslims?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   No.  Nowhere did the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party go to</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    kill Muslims or Croats or any kind of civilians.  Wherever they went, they</P>\n","<P> 2    were part of the JNA, and they went there to fight against the</P>\n","<P> 3    paramilitary units that wanted to break up Yugoslavia.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, it's important to know the</P>\n","<P> 5    location.  I'm not sure whether Mr. Nice or Mr. Kay can help.  Your note</P>\n","<P> 6    doesn't identify clearly the name of this place?</P>\n","<P> 7            MR. NICE:  I tried to make an electronic search but for various</P>\n","<P> 8    reasons it doesn't work at the moment or doesn't work for this witness on</P>\n","<P> 9    this particular part of his evidence.  I'll try again.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  You said Pobrezje.</P>\n","<P>12            Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   The same witness, Ahmet Zulic, on page 30047, says in Sanski Most</P>\n","<P>15    there was no fighting, but the civilians fled because Seselj's men were</P>\n","<P>16    there.</P>\n","<P>17            Your men caused fear among civilians, although there was no</P>\n","<P>18    fighting there, as he says, in Sanski Most.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,</P>\n","<P>20    throughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did</P>\n","<P>21    not fight in any location.</P>\n","<P>22            This reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a</P>\n","<P>23    certain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying</P>\n","<P>24    that sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.</P>\n","<P>25    Somebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    arriving, and he spread panic.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that the Serbian word for</P>\n","<P> 3    sugar resembles Mr. Seselj's name.</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere</P>\n","<P> 5    in that area.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  \"From the</P>\n","<P> 8    1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan</P>\n","<P> 9    Milosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint</P>\n","<P>10    criminal,\" and so on,\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise</P>\n","<P>11    aided and abetted,\" and so on and so forth, all these phrases, \"the</P>\n","<P>12    planning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories</P>\n","<P>13    of Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>\n","<P>14    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.\"</P>\n","<P>15            Tell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in</P>\n","<P>16    this joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged</P>\n","<P>17    crimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made</P>\n","<P>18    here?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from</P>\n","<P>20    Serbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia</P>\n","<P>21    and Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted</P>\n","<P>22    to proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the</P>\n","<P>23    will of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the</P>\n","<P>24    West who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or</P>\n","<P>25    execution or extermination.  There was no plan.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            When the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in</P>\n","<P> 2    many places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only</P>\n","<P> 3    where the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats</P>\n","<P> 4    were in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,</P>\n","<P> 5    not a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the</P>\n","<P> 6    majority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They</P>\n","<P> 7    had already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we</P>\n","<P> 9    have already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the</P>\n","<P>10    other places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>\n","<P>11    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in</P>\n","<P>12    any kind of military activities?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in</P>\n","<P>14    January, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but</P>\n","<P>15    the UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,</P>\n","<P>16    although they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was</P>\n","<P>17    established, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be</P>\n","\n","<P>18    disarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.</P>\n","<P>19            The Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian</P>\n","<P>20    villages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there</P>\n","<P>21    were two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active</P>\n","<P>22    in the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces</P>\n","<P>23    in the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the</P>\n","<P>24    only activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica</P>\n","<P>25    area.  It was in the beginning of 1993.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            As for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,</P>\n","<P> 2    I don't know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up</P>\n","<P> 3    only in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all</P>\n","<P> 4    over Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army</P>\n","<P> 5    of the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska</P>\n","<P> 6    Krajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his</P>\n","<P> 7    volunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars</P>\n","<P> 8    there, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed</P>\n","<P>10    and what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy</P>\n","<P>11    that we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in</P>\n","<P>12    whole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and</P>\n","<P>13    Herzegovina?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and</P>\n","<P>15    there was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen</P>\n","<P>16    happened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on</P>\n","<P>17    their own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit</P>\n","<P>18    murders or anything of the kind.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war</P>\n","<P>20    in Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the</P>\n","<P>21    other participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by</P>\n","<P>22    Mr. Nice.</P>\n","<P>23            Look at paragraph 33.  We've just been discussing paragraph 32.  I</P>\n","<P>24    won't read the beginning of paragraph 33 because it's the same:  \"From on</P>\n","<P>25    or about the 1st of March, 1992,\" and so on and so forth, and then it</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    says:  \"On the territory of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa,</P>\n","<P> 2    Bosanski Novi, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Sarajevo (Ilijas), Kljuc,</P>\n","<P> 3    Kalinovik, Kotor Varos, Nevesinje, Sarajevo, Novi Grad, Sarajevo, Novo</P>\n","<P> 4    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Rudo, Sanski Most, Srebrenica</P>\n","<P> 5    again, Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\"  Please --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You are finished reading that list.  Let me</P>\n","<P> 7    remind you, Mr. Milosevic, that the Rule 98 bis decision found that there</P>\n","<P> 8    was not enough evidence to support the allegation in paragraph 32 in</P>\n","<P> 9    relation to some of the villages or municipalities mentioned.  In fact, as</P>\n","<P>10    far as paragraph 32 is concerned, you need only concern yourself with</P>\n","<P>11    Brcko, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Bijeljina, Kotor Varos, Kljuc,</P>\n","<P>12    Bosanski Novi.  And I am checking to see whether the decision affected</P>\n","<P>13    paragraph 33.</P>\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, could you please let</P>\n","<P>15    me know what evidence, as you say there was no evidence for these places,</P>\n","<P>16    but what was the evidence that Mr. Nice presented here about the other</P>\n","<P>17    places linking me --</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.  Mr. Milosevic, the Rule 98 bis</P>\n","<P>19    decision was published and was available to you.  But I bring that to your</P>\n","<P>20    attention so we don't waste time.  And I'll ask the legal officer to give</P>\n","<P>21    me the information in relation to paragraph 33.</P>\n","<P>22            Go ahead, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>23            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   As I was saying, Mr. Seselj, I read out a list here.  It's a long</P>\n","<P>25    paragraph with all the names of the towns where I, together with others,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    am charged with working for the extermination of Muslims and Croats.  You</P>\n","<P> 2    know the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that</P>\n","<P> 3    referred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded</P>\n","<P> 4    in any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted</P>\n","<P> 6    to, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A</P>\n","<P> 7    civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally</P>\n","<P> 8    wanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a</P>\n","<P> 9    constituent people.</P>\n","<P>10            And the question arises from there where are the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>11    Mostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>12    Travnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>13    many other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats</P>\n","<P>14    during that civil war?</P>\n","<P>15            After the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the</P>\n","<P>16    population, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did</P>\n","<P>17    take place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,</P>\n","<P>18    in figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I</P>\n","<P>19    can put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes</P>\n","<P>20    crimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,</P>\n","<P>21    sometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,</P>\n","<P>22    criminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and</P>\n","<P>23    revenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes</P>\n","<P>24    did not exist.  That did not happen.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    joint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I'd like</P>\n","<P> 2    to draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of</P>\n","<P> 3    December, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33</P>\n","<P> 4    and indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns</P>\n","<P> 5    are repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns</P>\n","<P> 6    too.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.</P>\n","<P> 7            So what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during</P>\n","<P> 8    that period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of</P>\n","<P> 9    December 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring</P>\n","<P>10    Bosnia and Herzegovina?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia</P>\n","<P>12    or, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of</P>\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It</P>\n","<P>14    did not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help</P>\n","<P>15    materially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs</P>\n","<P>16    living over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different</P>\n","<P>17    political relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership</P>\n","<P>18    of Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in</P>\n","<P>19    which those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep</P>\n","<P>20    conflicts, and they didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues.</P>\n","<P>21            So throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the</P>\n","<P>22    indictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,</P>\n","<P>23    the leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered</P>\n","<P>24    in looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far</P>\n","<P>25    accepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    attacked ourselves for our part.</P>\n","<P> 2            So I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy</P>\n","<P> 3    dating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact</P>\n","<P> 4    that that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all</P>\n","<P> 5    costs.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no</P>\n","<P> 6    alternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at</P>\n","<P> 7    the price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept</P>\n","<P> 8    because they were not able to take such great concessions.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities</P>\n","<P>10    of that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these</P>\n","<P>11    towns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I</P>\n","<P>12    personally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,</P>\n","<P>13    et cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason</P>\n","<P>14    explanation?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Yes, I do, and that's explanation is the following and the fact</P>\n","<P>16    that through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,</P>\n","<P>17    and --</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not</P>\n","<P>19    an explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.</P>\n","<P>20            So please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,</P>\n","<P>23    Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac</P>\n","<P>24    again, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in</P>\n","<P>25    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with</P>\n","<P> 2    regard to that point of the indictment?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised</P>\n","<P> 4    crime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don't know whether in all the</P>\n","<P> 5    places enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took</P>\n","<P> 6    place in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each</P>\n","<P> 7    individual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the</P>\n","<P> 8    motives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are</P>\n","<P> 9    still living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can</P>\n","<P>10    be established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side</P>\n","<P>11    and the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to</P>\n","<P>12    investigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to</P>\n","<P>13    strike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the</P>\n","<P>14    number of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you've said when you said</P>\n","<P>16    that some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let's look at</P>\n","<P>17    that for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of</P>\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or</P>\n","<P>19    formations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes</P>\n","<P>20    that you know of?  Are there any links?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of</P>\n","<P>22    power and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as</P>\n","<P>23    well, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,</P>\n","<P>24    the Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the</P>\n","<P>25    Academy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    everybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out</P>\n","<P> 2    against them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for</P>\n","<P> 3    freedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were</P>\n","<P> 4    being perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes</P>\n","<P> 5    should be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind</P>\n","<P> 6    via the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political</P>\n","<P> 7    parties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which</P>\n","<P> 8    strove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors</P>\n","<P> 9    spoke out against crimes.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>11            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Now, we -- let's look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful</P>\n","<P>13    confinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,</P>\n","<P>14    Bosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the</P>\n","<P>15    territories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,</P>\n","<P>16    Samac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,</P>\n","<P>17    Kotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,</P>\n","<P>18    Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>19            Tell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these</P>\n","<P>20    people in these towns did we take part in?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have</P>\n","<P>22    had anything to do with any such thing.</P>\n","<P>23            First of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What</P>\n","<P>24    the confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of</P>\n","<P>25    civilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    unlawful, and there were such cases.</P>\n","<P> 2            Now, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of</P>\n","<P> 3    all, there were individual instances in some of these places through the</P>\n","<P> 4    self-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance</P>\n","<P> 5    of Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.</P>\n","<P> 6    And then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of</P>\n","<P> 7    their own because they couldn't influence him.  He appeared as a factor,</P>\n","<P> 8    and there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his</P>\n","<P> 9    motives were of a criminal nature.</P>\n","<P>10            There were other such cases in some of these places whereby</P>\n","<P>11    somebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in</P>\n","<P>12    order to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive</P>\n","<P>13    money and then release them once they received money for that.  There were</P>\n","<P>14    also instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,</P>\n","<P>15    somebody's family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or</P>\n","<P>16    Croats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often</P>\n","<P>17    were not able to prevent revenge of that kind.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Which authorities?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian</P>\n","<P>21    authorities intervene?</P>\n","<P>22       A.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn't influence or involve</P>\n","<P>23    themselves in any such matters.</P>\n","<P>24            So as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one</P>\n","<P>25    should take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    those cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and</P>\n","<P> 2    what the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.</P>\n","<P> 3            Now, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places</P>\n","<P> 4    where possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of</P>\n","<P> 5    context and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse</P>\n","<P> 6    top-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian</P>\n","<P> 7    Yugoslavia as well.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has</P>\n","<P> 9    become a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you</P>\n","<P>10    say that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing</P>\n","<P>11    like the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged</P>\n","<P>12    by the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn't understand me correctly,</P>\n","<P>14    Mr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,</P>\n","<P>15    but there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top</P>\n","<P>16    echelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely</P>\n","<P>17    impossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like</P>\n","<P>18    that, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is</P>\n","<P>19    impossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such</P>\n","<P>20    thing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did</P>\n","<P>21    commit crimes.  And it wasn't only individuals who committed crimes.</P>\n","<P>22    There was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.</P>\n","<P>23    And I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my</P>\n","<P>24    information, but I can't be well-versed in everything, but I can in</P>\n","<P>25    basics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    wasn't the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit</P>\n","<P> 2    crimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn't the policy of the</P>\n","<P> 3    leadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.</P>\n","<P> 4            Now, --</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn't the policy of this accused in</P>\n","<P> 6    concert with other --</P>\n","<P> 7            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of</P>\n","<P> 8    Mr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,</P>\n","<P> 9    continuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such</P>\n","<P>10    crimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the</P>\n","<P>11    most serious form of war crimes.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There's an enormous</P>\n","<P>15    list of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,</P>\n","<P>16    and the subject here is deportation.</P>\n","<P>17            Now, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let's clarify that.  Albeit in</P>\n","<P>18    Serbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,</P>\n","<P>19    Muslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,</P>\n","<P>20    70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle</P>\n","<P>21    of non-discrimination like anybody else.</P>\n","<P>22            Now, I can't clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is</P>\n","<P>23    being accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it</P>\n","<P>24    stated here -- it says:  \"Milosevic, acting alone or together with other</P>\n","<P>25    members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or</P>\n","<P> 2    execution of the unlawful forcible transfer...\"</P>\n","<P> 3            Now, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic</P>\n","<P> 4    of Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or</P>\n","<P> 5    unlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful</P>\n","<P> 6    movement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one</P>\n","<P> 7    individual?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with</P>\n","<P> 9    anything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these</P>\n","<P>10    phenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what</P>\n","<P>11    did happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group</P>\n","<P>12    to leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that</P>\n","<P>13    desire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were</P>\n","<P>14    instances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,</P>\n","<P>15    that people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,</P>\n","<P>16    something afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind</P>\n","<P>17    what had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to</P>\n","<P>18    move out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or</P>\n","<P>19    perhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they</P>\n","<P>20    were the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and</P>\n","<P>21    in some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established</P>\n","<P>22    in some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete</P>\n","<P>23    example, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from</P>\n","<P>24    Prijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a</P>\n","<P>25    convoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I'm stopping you because you have</P>\n","<P> 2    answered the question.  You are becoming a little too expansive.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think that this would be very</P>\n","<P> 4    important.</P>\n","<P> 5            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what example do you know of personally?</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   I'm talking about one example when Muslims were transported</P>\n","<P> 8    because they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And</P>\n","<P> 9    then the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose</P>\n","<P>10    name is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is</P>\n","<P>11    called Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large</P>\n","<P>12    group of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the</P>\n","<P>13    authorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part</P>\n","<P>14    of Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army</P>\n","<P>15    of Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.</P>\n","<P>16            Then he tried to explain this in a completely different way:</P>\n","<P>17    Somebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he's</P>\n","<P>18    trying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.</P>\n","<P>19            Such people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,</P>\n","<P>20    entered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and</P>\n","<P>21    then they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed</P>\n","<P>22    although they are invariably false because --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm stopping you.  Mr. Seselj, no doubt you're a</P>\n","<P>24    man of many virtues.  Is omniscience one of them?  How do you happen to</P>\n","<P>25    know all these things?  I have to ask myself that question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson --</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Where is your knowledge coming from?</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, all my life I have</P>\n","<P> 4    been learning, learning, learning, and constantly learning.  Even now in</P>\n","<P> 5    prison I read eight to ten hours a day, although the conditions under</P>\n","<P> 6    which I live are very poor because they want to prevent me from preparing</P>\n","<P> 7    my defence case properly.  But I'm a constant learner, and I wish others</P>\n","<P> 8    were too.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  It would help my appreciation of your evidence if</P>\n","<P>10    only occasionally we were told of the basis for the information that you</P>\n","<P>11    have about specific matters.</P>\n","<P>12            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of</P>\n","<P>15    Serbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and</P>\n","<P>16    that as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon</P>\n","<P>17    what do you base this statement?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I</P>\n","<P>19    base my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent</P>\n","<P>20    statements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.</P>\n","<P>21            Secondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.</P>\n","<P>22    They never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never</P>\n","<P>23    discriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the</P>\n","<P>24    authorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in</P>\n","<P>25    Bosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    and treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.</P>\n","<P> 2            So there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic</P>\n","<P> 3    whatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution</P>\n","<P> 4    of Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in</P>\n","<P> 5    Serbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal</P>\n","<P> 6    of money.  Perhaps not all of them were happy with what they got, but this</P>\n","<P> 7    involved major expenditure on the part of the state.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  But did the authorities of Serbia allow</P>\n","<P> 9    discrimination over any Muslim Croat or the member of any other ethnic</P>\n","<P>10    group in Serbia during the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   No.  Even if there were any incidents on ethnic grounds, the</P>\n","<P>12    authorities acted in accordance with the law and brought such matters to</P>\n","<P>13    trial.  They simply did not allow things like that to happen.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Please look at paragraph 42 now.  Again it says here:  \"Slobodan</P>\n","<P>15    Milosevic,\" and so on and so forth, on or about the 1st of March, 1992,</P>\n","<P>16    until 391st of December, 1995, acting alone or in concert with members of</P>\n","<P>17    the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or</P>\n","<P>18    otherwise aided and abetted the planning preparation or execution of</P>\n","<P>19    wanton destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the</P>\n","<P>20    Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations and then\" --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, too fast.  Too fast.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   So I, Mr. Seselj, according to this paragraph 42, aided and</P>\n","<P>24    abetted the planning, preparation or execution, I executed this.  It</P>\n","<P>25    wasn't that I only aided and abetted others, but I committed wanton</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the Bosnian</P>\n","<P> 2    Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations, and again all these</P>\n","<P> 3    municipalities are listed here where I committed wanton looting of</P>\n","<P> 4    property belonging to Muslims and Croats.</P>\n","<P> 5            Please tell us not only what you know about this but also on the</P>\n","<P> 6    basis of what you know what you know.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in</P>\n","<P> 8    any way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of</P>\n","<P> 9    private and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three</P>\n","<P>10    sides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything</P>\n","<P>11    under control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.</P>\n","<P>12            What happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims</P>\n","<P>13    would loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have</P>\n","<P>14    their own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar</P>\n","<P>15    way in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no</P>\n","<P>16    official authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No</P>\n","<P>17    one personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,</P>\n","<P>18    et cetera.</P>\n","<P>19            There were paramilitary formations that had looting as their</P>\n","<P>20    primary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also</P>\n","<P>21    from Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People</P>\n","<P>22    travelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize</P>\n","<P>23    their car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were</P>\n","<P>24    such cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial</P>\n","<P>25    Chamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    looting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions</P>\n","<P> 2    that were rather chaotic.</P>\n","<P> 3            There was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.</P>\n","<P> 4    Not only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika</P>\n","<P> 5    Srpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in</P>\n","<P> 7    a military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto</P>\n","<P> 8    civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and</P>\n","<P> 9    wounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.</P>\n","<P>10            You were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please</P>\n","<P>11    explain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,</P>\n","<P>12    tell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of</P>\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.</P>\n","<P>14       A.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a</P>\n","<P>15    dissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict</P>\n","<P>16    in Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of</P>\n","<P>17    the duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case</P>\n","<P>18    elsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on</P>\n","<P>19    both sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less</P>\n","<P>20    casualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what</P>\n","<P>21    Judge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I</P>\n","<P>22    read.</P>\n","<P>23            I was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the</P>\n","<P>24    killing of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted</P>\n","<P>25    intentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Muslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present</P>\n","<P> 2    this in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,</P>\n","<P> 3    Vasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not</P>\n","<P> 4    take part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official</P>\n","<P> 5    factors from Serbia, that is.</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.  On the transcript it's a double</P>\n","<P> 7    negative.</P>\n","<P> 8            Yes, Mr. --</P>\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] There is a double negative in the</P>\n","<P>10    Serbian language and it does not change the meaning of the statement.  In</P>\n","<P>11    English it might mean something different.  I'm sorry I don't know English</P>\n","<P>12    and I cannot really adjust to this.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or</P>\n","<P>15    deny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took</P>\n","<P>16    part in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you</P>\n","<P>17    confirm that?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   All right.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The</P>\n","<P>21    Muslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the</P>\n","<P>22    liberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his</P>\n","<P>24    witness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,</P>\n","<P>25    including women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only</P>\n","<P> 2    logical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee</P>\n","<P> 3    from war.  They're fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.</P>\n","<P> 4            Very often in this war and in any other war civilians would get</P>\n","<P> 5    killed by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from</P>\n","<P> 6    the conflict.</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the</P>\n","<P> 8    Serbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it's supposed</P>\n","<P> 9    to seem?</P>\n","<P>10       A.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray</P>\n","<P>11    this, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their</P>\n","<P>12    victims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We</P>\n","<P>13    are faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is</P>\n","<P>14    based and anti-Serb grounds.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings</P>\n","<P>16    happened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all</P>\n","<P>17    of that can be found here in this indictment that I've been quoting to</P>\n","<P>18    you, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to</P>\n","<P>20    give.  Ask another question.</P>\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a</P>\n","<P>22    question to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that</P>\n","<P>23    he can give an answer.  He's a politician, an intellectual, a university</P>\n","<P>24    professor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,</P>\n","<P>25    and he is in a position to give an answer to this question.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And I've already ruled that he is not to answer</P>\n","<P> 2    it.  So proceed.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the</P>\n","<P> 6    JNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know</P>\n","<P> 7    about that?  This is on transcript page 20408.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The</P>\n","<P> 9    two sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the</P>\n","<P>10    bridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric</P>\n","<P>11    power plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to</P>\n","<P>12    destroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old</P>\n","<P>13    hydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the</P>\n","<P>14    paramilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The</P>\n","<P>15    conflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can't say exactly, I</P>\n","<P>16    wasn't there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And</P>\n","<P>17    then also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units</P>\n","<P>19    committed crimes in Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there</P>\n","<P>21    that can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but</P>\n","<P>22    who it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are</P>\n","<P>23    ascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to</P>\n","<P>24    Karadzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.</P>\n","<P>25            In Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    people for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing</P>\n","<P> 5    them, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They</P>\n","<P> 6    are mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided</P>\n","<P> 7    by Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,</P>\n","<P> 8    Drinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you</P>\n","<P> 9    heard anything about this and what do you know about it?</P>\n","<P>10       A.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my</P>\n","<P>11    knowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but</P>\n","<P>12    once the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very</P>\n","<P>13    simply, who the victims were and who the executors were.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the</P>\n","<P>15    cultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many</P>\n","<P>16    persons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force</P>\n","<P>17    there is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I'll just go</P>\n","<P>18    on.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were</P>\n","<P>20    committed.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn't the JNA that</P>\n","<P>21    took part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take</P>\n","<P>22    part in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully</P>\n","<P>23    investigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims</P>\n","<P>24    are still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether</P>\n","<P>25    there was enough will to investigate this matter, and I've already</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    referred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect</P>\n","<P> 2    a great deal from that.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I don't know anything about it.  I wasn't there.</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj and Mr. Milosevic, you are not</P>\n","<P> 6    observing the pause between question and answer, and you are thereby</P>\n","<P> 7    creating difficulties for the interpreter.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, this is the first time</P>\n","<P> 9    you have warned us about this today.  As you see, Mr. Seselj and I are</P>\n","<P>10    bearing this in mind.</P>\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We're practising.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment</P>\n","<P>14    in this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your</P>\n","<P>15    units.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan's men.  Do</P>\n","<P>16    you have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your</P>\n","<P>17    units were there?  You've already explained you didn't have any units of</P>\n","<P>18    yours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers</P>\n","<P>19    were there?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I'm not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik</P>\n","<P>21    area.  I know that Arkan's Tigers were active there but to what extent and</P>\n","<P>22    in what locations I couldn't say because I wasn't there.</P>\n","<P>23            All the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I</P>\n","<P>24    do not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and</P>\n","<P>25    misfortunes he talked about, but evidently he's very confused when</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    identifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He's mixing up Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 2    men, the White Eagles, Arkan's men, and this shows that he's very confused</P>\n","<P> 3    and unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers</P>\n","<P> 4    of the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to</P>\n","<P> 5    everything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very</P>\n","<P> 6    often it's beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn't be easy to</P>\n","<P> 7    establish who actually perpetrated this.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a</P>\n","<P> 9    certain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the</P>\n","<P>10    transcript.  Do you know anything about this?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>12    committed any crimes in that place.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>14    Radical Party?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>16    sent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,</P>\n","<P>17    and as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me</P>\n","<P>18    had any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I'm sure of it.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Would other volunteers have reported this?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and</P>\n","<P>21    they would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,</P>\n","<P>22    because this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about</P>\n","<P>24    the conducts of the volunteers?</P>\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn't say the reports were</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    regular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out</P>\n","<P> 2    how the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All</P>\n","<P> 3    the problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of</P>\n","<P> 4    indiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers</P>\n","<P> 5    to be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline</P>\n","<P> 6    of the other men.</P>\n","<P> 7            I was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the</P>\n","<P> 8    conclusion that none occurred.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral</P>\n","<P>11    conversations.</P>\n","<P>12            I'm convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written</P>\n","<P>13    reports would have been sent to me.  I'm sure that the competent command</P>\n","<P>14    would have told me had something like this happened.</P>\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>16            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Mr. Seselj, if you can't recall it doesn't matter, but is it true</P>\n","<P>18    that in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,</P>\n","<P>19    1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of</P>\n","<P>20    Seselj's men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj's men, then</P>\n","<P>22    should be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell</P>\n","<P>23    you whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group</P>\n","<P>24    of Seselj's men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he's</P>\n","<P>25    the leader if they don't know his name?  What does the term \"leader\" mean?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Was he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times</P>\n","<P> 2    that volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in</P>\n","<P> 3    units larger than a company.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I</P>\n","<P> 6    have a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I</P>\n","<P> 7    wanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the</P>\n","<P> 8    indictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no</P>\n","<P> 9    such instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>10    Party.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such</P>\n","<P>14    instances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various</P>\n","<P>15    allegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of</P>\n","<P>16    time.</P>\n","<P>17            Please tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about</P>\n","<P>18    the events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men</P>\n","<P>19    participated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   First of all --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is that reference?</P>\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I quoted about half an hour ago, but</P>\n","<P>23    it wasn't sufficiently clear.  I will try to find it again.  I'm simply</P>\n","<P>24    trying to establish whether the witness knows anything about</P>\n","<P>25    Bosanski Samac.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have some knowledge but --</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  The answer -- the question I have is --  what do</P>\n","<P> 3    you mean by \"because it says,\" it says, \"that your men participated in</P>\n","<P> 4    taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\"  What is \"it\"?</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj something about</P>\n","<P> 6    Samac before, but right now I can't find it.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  I take it it's not another reference to the</P>\n","<P> 8    indictment against Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P> 9            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I don't think it is.</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have Bosanski Samac mentioned in</P>\n","<P>11    several places on your indictment, if I can be of assistance, and I can</P>\n","<P>12    tell you what I know about the events in Bosanski Samac.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Well, that's the only reason I asked you whether you knew</P>\n","<P>15    anything.</P>\n","<P>16       A.   In paragraph 42 Bosanski Samac is ascribed to you.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Well, all the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are</P>\n","<P>18    ascribed to me.  There aren't any which are not ascribed to me.  But what</P>\n","<P>19    do you know about the events there?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I don't understand this question.  You</P>\n","<P>21    can't just ask a question, take a municipality and say, \"What do you know</P>\n","<P>22    about events there?\"  There's got to be some point to the question.</P>\n","<P>23            Now, what is this dealing with?</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Very well.  I won't ask you anything about that, then, because I</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    can't find the reference now.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, Mr. Milosevic.  If you find the</P>\n","<P> 3    reference, you can come back to it, but bear in mind that you undertook to</P>\n","<P> 4    complete the evidence in chief today.</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I'm doing my best, Mr. Robinson, but</P>\n","<P> 6    there are many, many witnesses who mentioned Mr. Seselj, and I want to see</P>\n","<P> 7    whether there's any truth in anything they said.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, you may -- Mr. Milosevic, you may have</P>\n","<P> 9    other witnesses who may be in a better position to contradict the</P>\n","<P>10    assertions in the Prosecution case than Mr. Seselj himself.  Don't assume</P>\n","<P>11    that because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he's the</P>\n","<P>12    best person to contradict it.</P>\n","<P>13            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.</P>\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   On page 23520 of the transcript.  I'll skip over the witness's</P>\n","<P>16    name because I can't recall at present whether or not he was protected,</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Robinson.  I don't think he was, because I don't have any note to that</P>\n","<P>18    effect, but he says:  \"In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the</P>\n","<P>19    White Wolves, and the JNA participated.\"</P>\n","<P>20            Do you know anything about this?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,</P>\n","<P>22    there was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from</P>\n","<P>23    Eastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the</P>\n","<P>24    indictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.</P>\n","<P>25    His name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    helicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was</P>\n","<P> 2    accompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 3    Party, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for</P>\n","<P> 4    sure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also</P>\n","<P> 5    Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as</P>\n","<P> 6    the Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was</P>\n","<P> 7    charged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in</P>\n","<P> 8    Banja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 9    Party.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and</P>\n","<P>10    the party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don't know that Kragujevac</P>\n","<P>12    is not in Bosnia.</P>\n","<P>13       A.   That's correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I'm getting ready</P>\n","<P>14    to obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was</P>\n","<P>15    expelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan</P>\n","<P>16    Savic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the</P>\n","<P>17    Serb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave</P>\n","<P>18    my legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial</P>\n","<P>19    and all the accompanying materials.</P>\n","<P>20            As for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to</P>\n","<P>21    me certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man</P>\n","<P>22    Radovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his</P>\n","<P>23    participation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.</P>\n","<P>24            Those are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members</P>\n","<P>25    of the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    had previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even</P>\n","<P> 2    called him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was</P>\n","<P> 3    Srecko Radovanovic.</P>\n","<P> 4            There was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was</P>\n","<P> 5    certainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was</P>\n","<P> 6    certainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been</P>\n","<P> 7    he would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that</P>\n","<P> 8    unit was called the Grey Wolves.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I've understood</P>\n","<P>10    from that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions</P>\n","<P>11    in Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you've said?</P>\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,</P>\n","<P>13    yes.</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called</P>\n","<P>15    the Grey Wolves active there?</P>\n","<P>16            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it's very problematic to say</P>\n","<P>17    paramilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means</P>\n","<P>18    outside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial</P>\n","<P>19    Defence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I'm not</P>\n","<P>20    sure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,</P>\n","<P>21    I think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good</P>\n","<P>22    fighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what</P>\n","<P>23    happened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called</P>\n","<P>24    Crkvina or something like that.  I can't recall it all off the top of my</P>\n","<P>25    head, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Banja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven't dealt with.  Did</P>\n","<P> 3    they participate?</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What</P>\n","<P> 5    Red Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's a perfectly legitimate answer for you to</P>\n","<P> 7    give, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the</P>\n","<P> 8    Red Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the</P>\n","<P> 9    quotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,</P>\n","<P>10    which on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they've got</P>\n","<P>11    nothing to do with the question.  So all I'm doing now is trying to find</P>\n","<P>12    out what the real answer to that question is.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.</P>\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the</P>\n","<P>15    Red Berets.</P>\n","<P>16                          --- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.</P>\n","<P>17                          --- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the</P>\n","<P>19    technical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary</P>\n","<P>20    resulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected</P>\n","<P>21    witness.</P>\n","<P>22            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>23            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Wolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also</P>\n","<P> 2    mentioned.  Now, the witness, I don't know whether he was protected or</P>\n","<P> 3    not, I don't want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript says that he saw 20 locals, and it's about Samac, wearing</P>\n","<P> 5    uniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed</P>\n","<P> 6    they were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned</P>\n","<P> 7    to Samac.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, I don't have any information to that effect, and that is</P>\n","<P> 9    quite impossible.  I'd like to point out once again that in different</P>\n","<P>10    places they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had</P>\n","<P>11    found some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have</P>\n","<P>12    been various units, especially as we're talking about locals in this</P>\n","<P>13    particular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What</P>\n","<P>14    does it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some</P>\n","<P>15    warehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they</P>\n","<P>16    were some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the</P>\n","<P>17    Red Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of</P>\n","<P>18    the State Security in 1996.</P>\n","<P>19            So quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term</P>\n","<P>20    applies to different concepts.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I</P>\n","<P>22    think that is in the indictment against you but you'll put me right if I'm</P>\n","<P>23    wrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,</P>\n","<P>24    that is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,</P>\n","<P>25    wherein amongst others you said:  \"Dear brother Chetniks, especially you</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    across the Drina, you're the bravest, and we're going to clear up Bosnia</P>\n","<P> 2    from the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong.\"  Is</P>\n","<P> 3    it true that you said that?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and</P>\n","<P> 5    partially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,</P>\n","<P> 6    because -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don't always know</P>\n","<P> 7    the Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an</P>\n","<P> 8    artificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the</P>\n","<P> 9    Croats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian</P>\n","<P>10    variation \"pogan\" means \"pagan,\" where as in the Serb language \"pogan\"</P>\n","<P>11    means \"waste\" or \"faeces.\"  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and</P>\n","<P>12    pan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called</P>\n","<P>13    them \"pogani,\" which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the</P>\n","<P>14    Muslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I'm not a stupid</P>\n","<P>15    man.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have</P>\n","<P>16    nothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more</P>\n","<P>17    than I do to all the Christians afterwards, let's make that point clear,</P>\n","<P>18    but I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --</P>\n","<P>19    greatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims</P>\n","<P>20    to be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.</P>\n","<P>21            So here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion</P>\n","<P>22    is being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,</P>\n","<P>23    and I've been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,</P>\n","<P>24    Islamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they</P>\n","<P>25    first appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.  Well, if you</P>\n","<P> 4    haven't got if it in my books then the Prosecution probably has a copy</P>\n","<P> 5    because most of my speeches were published in my books, in my works so, if</P>\n","<P> 6    a speech does not happen to be there, if --</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  Was this one published in your books?  I apologise.</P>\n","<P> 8    I haven't read them all.</P>\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson [sic], two years ago I</P>\n","<P>10    handed over to The Hague Tribunal 80 of my printed works.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  Is this speech in any of them?</P>\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Most probably, but it would be up to</P>\n","<P>13    the Prosecution to find it, not me.  I can't look through that whole</P>\n","<P>14    matter myself, because I didn't make the statement only in one place.  I</P>\n","<P>15    made the statement in several places, on several occasions.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  Well, normally the party presenting the evidence is</P>\n","<P>17    responsible for getting it to court in some -- as official as is possible,</P>\n","<P>18    but you're not aware of a copy of it being available for us as part of the</P>\n","<P>19    papers in connection with your evidence.</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Bonomy, the side that has</P>\n","<P>21    referred to my alleged speech is the Prosecution's side.  So I'm just</P>\n","<P>22    telling you where they made a mistake.  So they can find the original of</P>\n","<P>23    the speech and present it here.  I can't do the work of the Prosecution.</P>\n","<P>24    I can't be expected to do that.  I am testifying to the facts and</P>\n","<P>25    circumstances about which I have knowledge.  I'm not here to help the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Prosecution out in its work.  And for my part, I have contributed</P>\n","<P> 2    sufficiently by handing over all my books.  They have far greater</P>\n","<P> 3    resources than I do.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Nice, can you help?  Where do I locate the</P>\n","<P> 5    evidence, readily locate the evidence in relation to this?</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. NICE:  I'm not sure you can locate it readily at the moment</P>\n","<P> 7    from our own database.  It may be possible.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  It appears Mr. Seselj is suggesting that there is</P>\n","<P> 9    evidence of this speech led by the Prosecution in this case.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  It may be in this case or it may be in the pre-trial</P>\n","<P>11    brief of his own case.  I'll deal with it as soon as I can.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  All right.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. NICE:  We can't of course be guided in the way we are going to</P>\n","<P>14    present our questions through his observations.  We'll make our own</P>\n","<P>15    decisions.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  No, no, no.  That's nothing to the point.  I'm just</P>\n","<P>17    trying to clarify where I can read this speech, but if no one's going to</P>\n","<P>18    help me, that's okay.</P>\n","<P>19            MR. NICE:  We certainly will help you when we can.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Witness B1643 who testified pursuant to 92 bis, I assume you know</P>\n","<P>23    the written part, mentioned torture and capture of civilians in the SUP</P>\n","<P>24    building of the Territorial Defence in the primary school and secondary</P>\n","<P>25    school in Crkvina, the warehouse there.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, I already mentioned something about this.  I said that the</P>\n","<P> 2    Crkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey</P>\n","<P> 3    Wolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was</P>\n","<P> 4    arrested, but I don't have any details about how the trial proceeded and</P>\n","<P> 5    the upshot.  I asked my legal advisors to find the complete dossier of</P>\n","<P> 6    that trial, but I do know for certain that he was arrested and taken to</P>\n","<P> 7    trial in Banja Luka, prosecuted in Banja Luka.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   The indictment against you, in the indictment you are accused of</P>\n","<P> 9    an act on the 7th of May, 1992, which allegedly happened there which says</P>\n","<P>10    that two leaders of your group under your command killed 18 males at the</P>\n","<P>11    agricultural farm in Crkvina.  Is that the event you are referring to?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn't there</P>\n","<P>13    nor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical</P>\n","<P>14    Party.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   That's all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your</P>\n","<P>16    answer suffices.</P>\n","<P>17            You are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when</P>\n","<P>18    allegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated</P>\n","<P>19    killed 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating</P>\n","<P>21    on the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?</P>\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was</P>\n","<P>23    quoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>\n","<P>24    So it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this</P>\n","<P>25    question of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    concept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he</P>\n","<P> 2    stands accused, because he's testifying here.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily</P>\n","<P> 4    relevant for that purpose.</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I'm not going to</P>\n","<P> 6    insist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.</P>\n","<P> 7            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993</P>\n","<P> 9    some members of your alleged --</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have</P>\n","<P>11    continued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not</P>\n","<P>12    see at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial</P>\n","<P>13    here.  I know that he's alleged to be a member of the joint criminal</P>\n","<P>14    enterprise.  I'm well aware of that.  But that doesn't let in any and all</P>\n","<P>15    kind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.</P>\n","<P>16            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see</P>\n","<P>17    here that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,</P>\n","<P>18    then that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren't true</P>\n","<P>19    either, and he has refuted a number of witnesses' statements here that I</P>\n","<P>20    quoted.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know</P>\n","<P>22    you know that.</P>\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, witness William Thomas Francis Roy on page 28882 of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the transcript stated here that the Muslim snipers killed three pregnant</P>\n","<P> 2    women and only then did the Serb snipers respond by opening fire.  Do you</P>\n","<P> 3    know anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked</P>\n","<P> 4    to killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire</P>\n","<P> 6    in Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front</P>\n","<P> 7    line stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part</P>\n","<P> 8    under Muslim control and another part under Serb control.</P>\n","<P> 9            Now, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind</P>\n","<P>10    the following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from</P>\n","<P>11    rifles which wasn't a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because</P>\n","<P>12    sniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with</P>\n","<P>13    optic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the</P>\n","<P>14    Serb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to</P>\n","<P>15    come by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black</P>\n","<P>16    market.  I don't exclude the possibility of individual cases there being</P>\n","<P>17    the need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was</P>\n","<P>18    opened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain</P>\n","<P>19    control of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two</P>\n","<P>20    sides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn't</P>\n","<P>21    change for many years, and one or the other side would take control of</P>\n","<P>22    certain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.</P>\n","<P>23            On the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional</P>\n","<P>24    killing of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims</P>\n","<P>25    killed about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    in Kazani and so on.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the</P>\n","<P> 3    Sarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present</P>\n","<P> 4    on both sides.  Is that true?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in</P>\n","<P> 6    Sarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The</P>\n","<P> 7    real snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far</P>\n","<P> 8    more than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more</P>\n","<P> 9    sophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more</P>\n","<P>10    favourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I've forgotten the evidence which I</P>\n","<P>12    think there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How</P>\n","<P>13    much personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the</P>\n","<P>14    conflict there.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to</P>\n","<P>16    the Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that</P>\n","<P>17    is.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.</P>\n","<P>18    At Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and</P>\n","<P>19    I met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh</P>\n","<P>20    shipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my</P>\n","<P>21    colleagues from university and also people whom I'd been to school with,</P>\n","<P>22    Muslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire</P>\n","<P>24    going on?</P>\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    stay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some</P>\n","<P> 2    dangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you</P>\n","<P> 3    had to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but</P>\n","<P> 4    there were no more serious conflicts at that time.</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,</P>\n","<P> 8    referred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on</P>\n","<P> 9    page 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs</P>\n","<P>10    fired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in</P>\n","<P>11    Sarajevo?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open</P>\n","<P>13    fire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be</P>\n","<P>14    ascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused</P>\n","<P>15    protected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction</P>\n","<P>16    from the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo</P>\n","<P>17    they would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at</P>\n","<P>18    Serb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off</P>\n","<P>19    in the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,</P>\n","<P>20    then they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at</P>\n","<P>21    hospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,</P>\n","<P>22    who were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the</P>\n","<P>23    hospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw</P>\n","<P>24    quickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived</P>\n","<P>25    they didn't come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    fire in retaliation.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited</P>\n","<P> 3    Bijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --</P>\n","<P> 4    page 8258 of Alija Gusalic's -- 18258, and I link this up with your</P>\n","<P> 5    indictment and Alija Gusalic's testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina</P>\n","<P> 6    and members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to</P>\n","<P> 7    takeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite</P>\n","<P> 9    correct.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just</P>\n","<P>10    nonsense.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there</P>\n","<P>12    were Arkan's men and Seselj's men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything</P>\n","<P>13    about that?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb</P>\n","<P>15    Radical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I'm absolutely certain</P>\n","<P>16    of that.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   The same witness says on page 18260, \"Seselj's men had beards and</P>\n","<P>18    cockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to</P>\n","<P>19    distribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party.\"</P>\n","<P>20       A.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>21    Radical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly</P>\n","<P>22    clean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not</P>\n","<P>23    bring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot</P>\n","<P>24    be synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for</P>\n","<P>25    ideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    not a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier</P>\n","<P> 2    having a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not</P>\n","<P> 3    distribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role</P>\n","<P> 4    in these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.</P>\n","<P> 5            Members of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but</P>\n","<P> 6    exclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now</P>\n","<P> 8    I'm asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were</P>\n","<P> 9    not Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were</P>\n","<P>10    held at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you</P>\n","<P>11    know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   I don't know about those particular localities, but I've already</P>\n","<P>13    talked about Mauzer's and Arkan's conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for</P>\n","<P>14    that reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often</P>\n","<P>15    attacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   I'm sorry that I didn't draw your attention to this on time,</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you</P>\n","<P>18    are being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in</P>\n","<P>19    Batkovic.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I've already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>21    Radical Party there.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.</P>\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic</P>\n","<P>24    testified here, and he made those assertions here, and I'm linking that up</P>\n","<P>25    with --</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness</P>\n","<P> 2    made the allegations here.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp</P>\n","<P> 4    near Bijeljina.  And I've linked that up to what the indictment against</P>\n","<P> 5    Mr. Seselj says.</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that's not relevant.  Move on.</P>\n","<P> 7            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused</P>\n","<P> 9    Mr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a</P>\n","<P>10    hundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?</P>\n","<P>11            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it's not relevant to</P>\n","<P>13    this case.</P>\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the</P>\n","<P>15    basis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks</P>\n","<P>16    about Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj's indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane</P>\n","<P>18    treatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's indictment?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the</P>\n","<P>23    International Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything</P>\n","<P>24    about this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   I don't know anything about the visit of the International Red</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Cross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.</P>\n","<P> 2    Also, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of</P>\n","<P> 3    prisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not</P>\n","<P> 4    take part in any such thing.</P>\n","<P> 5            As for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and</P>\n","<P> 6    if there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would</P>\n","<P> 7    have to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right.  I'm not going to ask you about this anymore.  You</P>\n","<P> 9    mentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is</P>\n","<P>10    that right?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the</P>\n","<P>13    activity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the</P>\n","<P>14    situation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,</P>\n","<P>15    do you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no</P>\n","<P>17    paramilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in</P>\n","<P>18    Mostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,</P>\n","<P>19    from the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>20    Party were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them</P>\n","<P>21    as highly disciplined on Belgrade television.</P>\n","<P>22            If there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have</P>\n","<P>23    been members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention</P>\n","<P>24    platoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not</P>\n","<P>25    preclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    was not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp</P>\n","<P> 3    there were Seselj's Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   That is absolutely impossible.  I've never heard of the White</P>\n","<P> 6    Eagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven't heard of this Buna</P>\n","<P> 7    camp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 8    Party, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared</P>\n","<P> 9    in Buna.  I don't know anything about this, but there should be proper</P>\n","<P>10    records to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White</P>\n","<P>11    Eagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any</P>\n","<P>12    Red Berets.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in</P>\n","<P>14    Nevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I</P>\n","<P>16    was in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and</P>\n","<P>17    in the Neretva valley.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in</P>\n","<P>20    Nevesinje.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   That will do.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable</P>\n","<P>23    number of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no</P>\n","<P>24    conflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large</P>\n","<P>25    number of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    were put up at various facilities there.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Do you know anything about a lake, Boracko Jezero, and a rest</P>\n","<P> 3    house there where about 19 persons were killed, according to the</P>\n","<P> 4    allegations made?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers</P>\n","<P> 6    of the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That's close to</P>\n","<P> 7    Konjic.  I've already said that there were members of the Serb guard</P>\n","<P> 8    there.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was</P>\n","<P> 9    there, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was</P>\n","<P>10    operating.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan's Serb</P>\n","<P>12    volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared</P>\n","<P>16    elsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities</P>\n","<P>17    had a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because</P>\n","<P>18    they stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then</P>\n","<P>19    they appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a</P>\n","<P>20    lot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic's.  As far as I</P>\n","<P>21    know, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>\n","<P>23       A.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav</P>\n","<P>24    Lajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   The Serb guard.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Of Vuk Draskovic?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from</P>\n","<P> 4    Novi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made</P>\n","<P> 6    to the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.  I've forgotten</P>\n","<P> 7    his first name.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Jovan.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Jovan Dulovic who testified here.  Mr. Robinson instructed me to</P>\n","<P>10    find the original documents that can be linked up to your submissions</P>\n","<P>11    since they refused to admit your submissions.</P>\n","<P>12            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I am sorry, Mr. Robinson.  If you're</P>\n","<P>13    telling me to have copies made I will do that, but I've just received</P>\n","<P>14    these copies.  This is a series of photocopies of articles written by</P>\n","<P>15    Jovan Dulovic and published in Ekspres Politika from the 16th of November,</P>\n","<P>16    the 26th of November, all of that in 1991.  Then the 18th of November, the</P>\n","<P>17    2nd of November.  So from November 1991.</P>\n","<P>18            In these articles, he speaks very favourably of the JNA and</P>\n","<P>19    commends their behaviour in the fighting around Vukovar.  For example, he</P>\n","<P>20    says that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats, saw the light of</P>\n","<P>21    the day after having stayed in cellars for many --</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, what is the question?</P>\n","<P>23            MR. NICE:  And, Your Honour, if I may interrupt, if there's going</P>\n","<P>24    to be a reference to and quotation from a newspaper article, it has to be</P>\n","<P>25    on the overhead projector.  It then has to be available to us to read it</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    in full should we wish to.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's -- that's the practice, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.</P>\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, since I have only one copy of these articles and I've</P>\n","<P> 6    just received that, could the usher please place them on the ELMO, and</P>\n","<P> 7    then you can have a look at least at some of the parts that have been</P>\n","<P> 8    marked.  Reference is made to Major Sljivancanin here, too, in a very</P>\n","<P> 9    favourable light.  Gratitude for assistance to civilians, Croats, at that,</P>\n","<P>10    and so on and so forth.  Please look at this series of articles.</P>\n","<P>11            In order to answer my question, are these at least partly articles</P>\n","<P>12    that you relied on when you wrote those submissions to the other side</P>\n","<P>13    about the untruthful testimony of Jovan Dulovic or, rather, the difference</P>\n","<P>14    in -- between his reporting then and his testimony here about Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>15            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, that was a leading but nevertheless it's</P>\n","<P>16    interesting to see what the articles actually say.  And if it becomes</P>\n","<P>17    relevant to consider their admissibility as evidence, I know the Chamber</P>\n","<P>18    will have in mind its open recent ruling in respect of the documents of</P>\n","<P>19    Jasovic and the potential evidential value or not as evidence of these</P>\n","<P>20    documents, but I'm most interested frankly in seeing what they actually</P>\n","<P>21    say.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let's get it on the overhead projector.</P>\n","<P>23            There appears to be a technical problem.  We're not seeing</P>\n","<P>24    anything.</P>\n","<P>25            Mr. Milosevic, the technician is being called.  He's coming in.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","<P>12   Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and</P>\n","<P>13   English transcripts.</P>\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    So move on to another question.  We'll come back to this.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am sorry, but my</P>\n","<P> 3    next question also has to do with something that Mr. Seselj already</P>\n","<P> 4    testified about and the document that I obtained in the meantime and that</P>\n","<P> 5    would also have to be placed on the ELMO.  That is --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,</P>\n","<P> 7    because the overhead projector is not working.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further</P>\n","<P> 9    questions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except</P>\n","<P>10    for this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a</P>\n","<P>11    decision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were</P>\n","<P>12    presented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal</P>\n","<P>13    government said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was</P>\n","<P>14    known who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.</P>\n","<P>15    The 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.  So it is about</P>\n","<P>16    40 days after the coup d'etat of the 5th of October, 2000.  It was then</P>\n","<P>17    that they were all released, set free.</P>\n","<P>18            So wanted to show you this document, and I wanted to hand out</P>\n","<P>19    copies to you.  I've just received this.  They are all in the Serbian</P>\n","<P>20    language but they can be placed on the ELMO to show what the government</P>\n","<P>21    spokesman had said was completely disregarded, and these persons mentioned</P>\n","<P>22    in the criminal report against Erdemovic were set free.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The ELMO is working now, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please take a look at this.  This is a series of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    articles from Ekspres Politika.  Can you see the date of the newspaper?</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of</P>\n","<P> 3    November.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   1991; right?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   1991.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Unless this is a leading question.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   It's illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one</P>\n","<P> 8    of the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when</P>\n","<P> 9    preparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.</P>\n","<P>10    That is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of</P>\n","<P>11    Evidence and Procedure.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the</P>\n","<P>13    subheading?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both</P>\n","<P>15    Serbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars</P>\n","<P>16    for a long time.  \"Light finally,\" is the heading.  And then in the</P>\n","<P>17    subheading:  \"Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas.\"  And then there's</P>\n","<P>18    another bit saying, \"In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,\"</P>\n","<P>19    and then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, \"I cannot believe</P>\n","<P>20    that we are alive,\" and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated</P>\n","<P>21    the town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.</P>\n","<P>22            THE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of</P>\n","<P>23    the question was not heard by the interpreters.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.  The interpreters have</P>\n","<P>25    indicated that you're overlapping and so she did not hear the beginning of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the last question.  Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P> 2            And please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.</P>\n","<P> 5    Perhaps it's easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text</P>\n","<P> 6    is.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as</P>\n","<P> 8    follows:  \"A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total</P>\n","<P> 9    of 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity.\"</P>\n","<P>10    That's what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and</P>\n","<P>11    Croats equally.  Civilians, that is.</P>\n","<P>12            I can't read the first paragraph because it's quite illegible, but</P>\n","<P>13    it seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,</P>\n","<P>14    that several ambulances were waiting to help.  \"It would not be a good</P>\n","<P>15    thing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now.\"</P>\n","<P>16            So Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of</P>\n","<P>17    Vukovar before the fighting had stopped.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Can you see the subtitle which says \"The cruel major\"?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this</P>\n","<P>21    refers to and what it says about this cruel major.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians</P>\n","<P>23    very nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that</P>\n","<P>24    surprised this Croat woman, and he says:  \"No knows what she as a Croat</P>\n","<P>25    heard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers.\"  So he's describing the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    behaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what</P>\n","<P> 2    Croatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very</P>\n","<P> 3    bad way.</P>\n","<P> 4            And then Major Sljivancanin says:  \"Whenever you need anything,</P>\n","<P> 5    look for me and I'll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to</P>\n","<P> 6    go, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full</P>\n","<P> 7    of gratitude.\"  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  \"He had</P>\n","<P> 8    followed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude.\"</P>\n","<P> 9            All this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now</P>\n","<P>10    Colonel Veselin Sljivancanin.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic</P>\n","<P>12    describes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, \"Take this</P>\n","<P>13    child to hospital immediately.\"</P>\n","<P>14       A.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, \"Take this child to the</P>\n","<P>15    hospital in Negoslavci right away,\" Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing</P>\n","<P>16    the ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  \"Let her be given</P>\n","<P>17    assistance and medicine.\"</P>\n","<P>18            A little later Vlatka's mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for</P>\n","<P>19    her daughter in the crowd.  \"Where is my child?  What have they done to</P>\n","<P>20    her?  Where have they taken her,\" Verica was crying out.</P>\n","<P>21            \"Don't be afraid.  She is in hospital,\" Sljivancanin said.  The</P>\n","<P>22    frightened woman didn't believe it.\"  This is followed by Dulovic's</P>\n","<P>23    comment:  \"Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA</P>\n","<P>24    soldiers.\"</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   And what does it say then?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   \"Get into my car.  I'll take you to the hospital so you can see</P>\n","<P> 2    your child and reassure yourself that everything is all right.  They both</P>\n","<P> 3    entered the vehicle.  In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and</P>\n","<P> 4    dressed Vlatka's wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the</P>\n","<P> 5    daughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them.\"</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   So this is Dulovic's report from the Vukovar war theatre.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on</P>\n","<P> 9    the following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points</P>\n","<P>10    are.  This large title, this heading, that is.</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.  Now it's been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a</P>\n","<P>12    statement, \"I believed in the army.\"  And what's in the subtitle.  \"A</P>\n","<P>13    little less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in</P>\n","<P>14    Vukovar.\"  And then there's a quotation.</P>\n","<P>15       A.   \"We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the</P>\n","<P>16    guards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the</P>\n","<P>17    hospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims.\"</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   And look what it says in the article.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the</P>\n","<P>20    following:  \"In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and</P>\n","<P>21    barricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house</P>\n","<P>22    number 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,</P>\n","<P>23    Milos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.  A few days</P>\n","<P>24    later, the members of the guards burst into the cellar.  These were</P>\n","<P>25    members of the Croatian National Guard Corps.  Get out or we'll throw a</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    bomb in.  The Chetniks are coming.  They're cutting everyone's throats.</P>\n","<P> 2    We're taking you to a shelter.\"</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   It's quite illegible.  Could you put some light on it?</P>\n","<P> 4            Look at the passages marked in yellow.  You don't have to read it</P>\n","<P> 5    all out, just a few passages.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.    \"Several of us -- or, rather, above us on the cemetery the guards</P>\n","<P> 7    members were stationed.  Milka Vidovic said, 'When they visited us in the</P>\n","<P> 8    cellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone's throats.  We</P>\n","<P> 9    Serbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the</P>\n","<P>10    only thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.  I</P>\n","<P>11    believed in our army and I believed they would arrive.'\"</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  What's the question in relation to this,</P>\n","<P>13    Mr. Milosevic?</P>\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what is the signature marked in yellow here?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   Jovan Dulovic.  The same Jovan Dulovic who four or five years</P>\n","<P>17    later changed his version by -- he turned around by 180 degrees because he</P>\n","<P>18    has become a mercenary of the Western intelligence services, and he writes</P>\n","<P>19    for the magazine Vreme which is the Belgrade branch of Western</P>\n","<P>20    intelligence agencies.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   Mr. Seselj, when you glanced through this article and you dealt</P>\n","<P>22    with it in your submission, is there a single word here which does not</P>\n","<P>23    speak favourably of the JNA and the people who fought in Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   No.  The texts are all exceptionally favourable, full of praise</P>\n","<P>25    for the soldiers and officers of the JNA during the fighting for Vukovar.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Would you look at the next page, please.  Let's just see what the</P>\n","<P> 2    date is.</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   The 18th, I suppose.  The 18th of November.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Well, move on.  Move on.</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Mr. Milosevic, Dulovic says here one day with volunteers and tank</P>\n","<P> 6    crews in the street fighting for the liberation of Vukovar.  He praises</P>\n","<P> 7    the volunteers who participated in the fighting for Vukovar as part of the</P>\n","<P> 8    JNA.  So this should be noted.</P>\n","<P> 9            Next page, please.  I think that it's very important to point this</P>\n","<P>10    out.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   And the signature is Jovan Dulovic.  What's the title of this</P>\n","<P>12    article?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   The title of this article is \"The Knights of Vukovar.\"</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   And who does it refer to?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   The units of Major Borivoje Tesic on the front line in Vukovar.</P>\n","<P>16    Major Borivoje Tesic I think -- says: \"I think this is the last stage of</P>\n","<P>17    the fighting.  Crews carrying out their tasks successfully and the help of</P>\n","<P>18    brave people is indispensable.\"  It speaks of Croatian Ustasha and so on.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic</P>\n","<P>22    said volunteers as part of JNA.  Could you show us the passage where</P>\n","<P>23    Mr. Dulovic said so?</P>\n","<P>24            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He says here:  \"One day with</P>\n","<P>25    volunteers and tank crews in the street fighting for the liberation of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Vukovar.\"  This is above the headline.</P>\n","<P> 2            Then he goes on to say:  \"Speaking favourably of Stanko Vujanovic,</P>\n","<P> 3    he says the commander of the 1st Company of the Territorial Defence of</P>\n","<P> 4    Vukovar who is said to be a man who knows no fear.\" It's quite difficult</P>\n","<P> 5    to read this.  My eyesight is not so good and this is not very legible.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Can it be enlarged?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   \"With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making</P>\n","<P> 9    openings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze</P>\n","<P>10    through and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.  The house in</P>\n","<P>11    which they stopped in Prugomijska [phoen] Street near the Brdo cafe is</P>\n","<P>12    under constant fire by snipers whose positionings are very difficult to</P>\n","<P>13    discern.\"</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE KWON:  Now, Mr. Seselj, I would like see to see the passage</P>\n","<P>15    which shows that they were part of JNA as you indicated.  Or was it your</P>\n","<P>16    comment?</P>\n","<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  Please.  In the entire text the</P>\n","<P>18    volunteers are spoken of as members of the JNA.  We have passage here in</P>\n","<P>19    the third column where it says it's in the late afternoon and the fighting</P>\n","<P>20    is dying down.  The volunteers --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Could you use the pointer.  And you indicate on the</P>\n","<P>22    newspaper on the ELMO, not your monitor.  Yes.</P>\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] \"It's late in the afternoon and the</P>\n","<P>24    fighting is dying down.  The volunteers have pierced deep, and they have</P>\n","<P>25    conquered territory between the enemy forces.  The fighters will stay here</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    until the morning.  There were no casualties today except for one soldier</P>\n","<P> 2    who was killed, and his name was Vignjevic.\"</P>\n","<P> 3            He then says:  \"We are going back while shells are flying over our</P>\n","<P> 4    heads and Howitzer shells and so on.\"</P>\n","<P> 5            This whole text implies that the volunteers why part of the JNA.</P>\n","<P> 6    Mr. Kwon, you have here an order showing that these volunteers joined the</P>\n","<P> 7    1st Guards Brigade.  The order was delivered to the OTP from Belgrade and</P>\n","<P> 8    it's beyond dispute.</P>\n","<P> 9            In the Vukovar, there were no troops outside the JNA.  There were</P>\n","<P>10    no paramilitary units.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  It is your comment.  I really didn't see any</P>\n","<P>12    concrete -- the description these volunteers as part of JNA by</P>\n","<P>13    Mr. Dulovic.</P>\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have to read the whole text and</P>\n","<P>15    everything will become clear to you.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE KWON:  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Look at the next page, please.  The following text or this one</P>\n","<P>19    again says the Knights of Vukovar, Major Borivoje Tesic's units on the</P>\n","<P>20    front line, and this is a large article which seems not to be by Dulovic,</P>\n","<P>21    but on the left-hand side there is a small one:  \"Brave commander falls,</P>\n","<P>22    Borovo Selo.\"  Would you look at the signature?  I believe it's by</P>\n","<P>23    Dulovic.  Could you scroll up?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   What does it say in the passage marked by yellow?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   The initials \"JD\" mean Jovan Dulovic.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   And what does it say in this last passage?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- \"The inhabitants of the</P>\n","<P> 4    Crepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,</P>\n","<P> 5    who with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village</P>\n","<P> 6    and one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the</P>\n","<P> 7    highest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages.\"</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   And he was killed?</P>\n","<P> 9       A.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives</P>\n","<P>10    him.  Next page.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a</P>\n","<P>12    look?  I haven't had time to look at it all carefully.</P>\n","<P>13       A.   Yes.  There's a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of</P>\n","<P>14    November.  \"Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate</P>\n","<P>15    Vukovar.\"</P>\n","<P>16            In these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate</P>\n","<P>17    Vukovar, and five years later he's saying something completely different.</P>\n","<P>18             \"Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in</P>\n","<P>19    Vukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb.\"  And then it</P>\n","<P>20    says:  \"The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back,\" and so on</P>\n","<P>21    and so forth.</P>\n","<P>22            So this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the</P>\n","<P>23    JNA.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It's been circled.</P>\n","<P>25       A.   Yes.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Very well.</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   The 4th of November, 1991.  \"For two days fierce fighting has not</P>\n","<P> 3    stopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in</P>\n","<P> 4    flames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of</P>\n","<P> 5    Njusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the</P>\n","<P> 6    Territorial Defence.  Advances by Territorial Defence units and volunteers</P>\n","<P> 7    from the direction of Trpinja stopped on the edge of Borovo Naselje.\"</P>\n","<P> 8            He then speaks of a Croatian mortar attack on Bobota [phoen] and</P>\n","<P> 9    so on.</P>\n","<P>10       Q.   Is this another report by Dulovic?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes, it's signed by Jovan Dulovic.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Is there anything else, any other report?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   I'm looking at another text here but I can't see whether it's by</P>\n","<P>14    Dulovic or not because it's not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian</P>\n","<P>15    volunteer guard but again a very favourable text.  I couldn't see -- I</P>\n","<P>16    can't see the name of the author here.  I can't see it on this page.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Is there anything else underneath, another report?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   \"Who are the volunteers,\" is the next title.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Well, I can't see anything anymore.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced</P>\n","<P>21    through the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is \"Through the holes</P>\n","<P>22    to the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>23    Unknown ammunition with inhumane bullets.\"</P>\n","<P>24            What happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used</P>\n","<P>25    weapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    because the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal</P>\n","<P> 2    organs.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I can't see what it says here in yellow, highlighted</P>\n","<P> 4    in yellow.</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It's Major Radic now</P>\n","<P> 6    who also stands accused in The Hague.  \"Throughout the month of October,</P>\n","<P> 7    the fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in</P>\n","<P> 8    the clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least</P>\n","<P> 9    one person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja</P>\n","<P>10    [phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in</P>\n","<P>11    that way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had</P>\n","<P>12    taken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.</P>\n","<P>13    The snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own</P>\n","<P>14    control and then a solution was found to move through the houses.\"</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic's article</P>\n","<P>16    again?</P>\n","<P>17       A.   Well, it's not legible but it is a series of articles by him.  We</P>\n","<P>18    can't find a signature here but quite obviously it is a series of articles</P>\n","<P>19    by him.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  Is that a series of articles to which you</P>\n","<P>21    referred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect</P>\n","<P>22    to Dulovic's testimony?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   Yes.  But this isn't the complete material.  My legal advisors</P>\n","<P>24    found many more texts of this kind and they quote them in extenso, and in</P>\n","<P>25    my submission I state my intention to disclose them in keeping with</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Rule 67 of the rules of evidence.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, I have one more question</P>\n","<P> 3    [as interpreted] -- Robinson, I have a question for you.  As my associates</P>\n","<P> 4    have managed to come by a set of these or at least photocopies of the</P>\n","<P> 5    papers from 1991 which Mr. Seselj refers to in his submission to the other</P>\n","<P> 6    side, the presentation of these photocopies, is that sufficient grounds</P>\n","<P> 7    for my request that they be accepted as exhibits, that Mr. Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 8    submission be accepted as an exhibit?</P>\n","<P> 9            MR. NICE:  Rather interesting issues, I think, arise on the</P>\n","<P>10    validity of these documents as exhibits, and it may be necessary to go</P>\n","<P>11    back and remind ourselves of what Mr. Dulovic himself said about these</P>\n","<P>12    matters.  So I would respectfully invite the Chamber to put that matter</P>\n","<P>13    back.  But may we see the -- may we have access to this material tonight</P>\n","<P>14    in copy form in any event?  It may be we have them elsewhere, but it will</P>\n","<P>15    be a difficult task to find them and it may in any event not be an</P>\n","<P>16    identical collection.  I simply don't know.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, we'll have to consider the</P>\n","<P>18    application that you're making.

[Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some</P>\n","<P>22    questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian</P>\n","<P>23    indictment, that have to do with the \"Rump Presidency\" as it's called</P>\n","<P>24    here.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  \"The Rump Presidency</P>\n","<P>25    carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies,\" and so on and so forth, \"had</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    effect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief.\"</P>\n","<P> 2            I'm not going to ask you to repeat what you've already said, but</P>\n","<P> 3    in relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of</P>\n","<P> 4    Serbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they</P>\n","<P> 5    not take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency</P>\n","<P> 6    of the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any</P>\n","<P> 7    objective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from</P>\n","<P> 8    carrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?</P>\n","<P> 9            The question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,</P>\n","<P>10    Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the</P>\n","<P>11    SFRY Presidency in Belgrade?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,</P>\n","<P>13    staying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was</P>\n","<P>14    never a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from</P>\n","<P>15    carrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped</P>\n","<P>16    coming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had</P>\n","<P>17    practically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe</P>\n","<P>18    Mesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying</P>\n","<P>19    that they could not come because they could not strike a balance in</P>\n","<P>20    relation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and</P>\n","<P>21    Montenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.</P>\n","<P>22            The representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were</P>\n","<P>23    not expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was</P>\n","<P>24    actually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display</P>\n","<P>25    such feelings at the time.  It's only when he left Belgrade and when he</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    came back to the Croatian parliament that he said, \"I've completed my</P>\n","<P> 2    duty.  Yugoslavia is no more.\"</P>\n","<P> 3            He pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.</P>\n","<P> 4    Also, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him</P>\n","<P> 5    sufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he</P>\n","<P> 6    condemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most</P>\n","<P> 7    cooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was</P>\n","<P> 8    what he was.</P>\n","<P> 9            I already said that according to the constitution of the then</P>\n","<P>10    Yugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one</P>\n","<P>11    single member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been</P>\n","<P>12    prevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could</P>\n","<P>13    have gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could</P>\n","<P>14    have refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the</P>\n","<P>15    Presidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the</P>\n","<P>16    Presidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed</P>\n","<P>17    within the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably</P>\n","<P>18    before Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a</P>\n","<P>19    Rump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of</P>\n","<P>20    a rump Presidency.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  \"Slobodan Milosevic,</P>\n","<P>24    in his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that</P>\n","<P>25    Yugoslavia was finished.\"</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            Please, you've got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I'm not</P>\n","<P> 2    going to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much</P>\n","<P> 3    time.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to</P>\n","<P> 4    here or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that</P>\n","<P> 5    Yugoslavia was finished?</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say</P>\n","<P> 7    that Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you</P>\n","<P> 8    never said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I</P>\n","<P> 9    remember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the</P>\n","<P>10    behaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went</P>\n","<P>11    through a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,</P>\n","<P>12    constitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,</P>\n","<P>13    but then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional</P>\n","<P>14    provision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases</P>\n","<P>15    to exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the</P>\n","<P>16    matter.</P>\n","<P>17            The leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never</P>\n","<P>18    did it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and</P>\n","<P>19    Croatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and</P>\n","<P>20    Macedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro</P>\n","<P>21    proclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting</P>\n","<P>22    of two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration</P>\n","<P>23    on your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   \"In March 1991 the collective Presidency of the SFRY reached a</P>\n","<P> 2    deadlock on several issues.\"  That is paragraph 56.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... that sentence</P>\n","<P> 4    which is at the beginning of the paragraph.  There's another allegation in</P>\n","<P> 5    that last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no</P>\n","<P> 6    longer be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask</P>\n","<P> 7    Mr. Seselj whether that is so.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember</P>\n","<P> 9    at that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian</P>\n","<P>10    public, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the</P>\n","<P>11    decisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that</P>\n","<P>12    Serbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation</P>\n","<P>13    when the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.</P>\n","<P>14            I would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there</P>\n","<P>15    was a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the</P>\n","<P>16    headquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long</P>\n","<P>17    debate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the</P>\n","<P>18    demand of the military to declare a state of emergency.</P>\n","<P>19            The top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the</P>\n","<P>20    behaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a</P>\n","<P>21    vote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.  As far as I can</P>\n","<P>22    remember --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You have answered the question I asked, thanks.</P>\n","<P>24            Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   That is what is referred to here.  It says the representatives on</P>\n","<P> 2    the Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,</P>\n","<P> 3    the autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of</P>\n","<P> 4    Kosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what</P>\n","<P> 5    was so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the</P>\n","<P> 6    Presidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also</P>\n","<P> 8    start the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven't got the document here</P>\n","<P> 9    so I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were</P>\n","<P>10    actually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already</P>\n","<P>11    started putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the</P>\n","<P>12    Presidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the</P>\n","<P>13    Presidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not</P>\n","<P>14    very constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the</P>\n","<P>15    Presidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,</P>\n","<P>16    or Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.</P>\n","<P>17    I think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been</P>\n","<P>18    recalled in the meantime.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that</P>\n","<P>20    session or before that session or in relation to that session I never</P>\n","<P>21    declared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did</P>\n","<P>22    they declare that Yugoslavia was finished?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   I've already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian</P>\n","<P>24    politicians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was</P>\n","<P>25    one of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    hard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.</P>\n","<P> 2            As for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in</P>\n","<P> 3    Montenegro either.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to</P>\n","<P> 5    normal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic</P>\n","<P> 6    was elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented</P>\n","<P> 7    Vojvodina at the time.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the</P>\n","<P> 9    Presidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started</P>\n","<P>10    working again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its</P>\n","<P>11    work.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of</P>\n","<P>12    Bosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil</P>\n","<P>13    Tupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new</P>\n","<P>14    crisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be</P>\n","<P>15    elected president of the Presidency.</P>\n","<P>16            There was a principle involved that the president of the</P>\n","<P>17    Presidency was elected from a different republican province every year but</P>\n","<P>18    nobody's election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic</P>\n","<P>19    did not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European</P>\n","<P>20    envoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to</P>\n","<P>21    elect him nevertheless.</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting</P>\n","<P>24    the preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from</P>\n","<P>25    those positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says</P>\n","<P> 2    that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and</P>\n","<P> 3    discussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between</P>\n","<P> 4    Serbia and Croatia?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I</P>\n","<P> 6    remember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what</P>\n","<P> 7    was skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching</P>\n","<P> 8    agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the</P>\n","<P> 9    Bosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a</P>\n","<P>10    situation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it</P>\n","<P>11    increasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the</P>\n","<P>12    country at the time.</P>\n","<P>13            At that time, I -- as I've already said, the presidents of the</P>\n","<P>14    presidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys</P>\n","<P>15    had actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach</P>\n","<P>16    agreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia</P>\n","<P>17    increasingly so.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through</P>\n","<P>19    what medium?</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully</P>\n","<P>21    being bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media</P>\n","<P>22    this kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were</P>\n","<P>23    already at that time being financed from the West by different Western</P>\n","<P>24    intelligence agencies, so that's the kind of media I'm talking about.  In</P>\n","<P>25    Belgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    federal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic</P>\n","<P> 2    government, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government</P>\n","<P> 3    in Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the</P>\n","<P> 4    Western powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante</P>\n","<P> 5    Markovic's government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible</P>\n","<P> 6    agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 7    together under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been</P>\n","<P> 8    eliminated.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at</P>\n","<P>12    one stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence</P>\n","<P>13    counsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest</P>\n","<P>14    collaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This</P>\n","<P>15    denies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of</P>\n","<P>16    Bosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted</P>\n","<P>17    into evidence and if not we will find this transcript.</P>\n","<P>18            However, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with</P>\n","<P>19    you as you were an active participant in all political events.  This</P>\n","<P>20    meeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the</P>\n","<P>21    division of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any</P>\n","<P>22    member of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning</P>\n","<P>23    of which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way</P>\n","<P>24    even indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    if Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 2    as an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as</P>\n","<P> 3    a constituent nation as they had been before in the previous</P>\n","<P> 4    constitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the</P>\n","<P> 5    first president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it</P>\n","<P> 6    was not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint</P>\n","<P> 7    state.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans</P>\n","<P> 8    persuaded him to call off the agreement.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It</P>\n","<P>10    says:  \"On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY</P>\n","<P>11    Presidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,</P>\n","<P>12    Sejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY</P>\n","<P>13    Presidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the</P>\n","<P>14    Presidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and</P>\n","<P>15    Macedonia.\"</P>\n","<P>16            On the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.  Was this</P>\n","<P>17    a kind of takeover of the function of the Presidency or were these</P>\n","<P>18    functions being carried out by the legal representatives?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   There was absolutely no takeover.  When four of the members of the</P>\n","<P>20    Presidency withdrew and some of them officially gave notice that they were</P>\n","<P>21    no longer members, like Drnovsek, for instance, while others simply</P>\n","<P>22    stopped attending the sessions.  The Presidency continued working with the</P>\n","<P>23    members who -- whom it was possible to gather together.</P>\n","<P>24            I suggest that the Chamber get hold of this piece of legislation.</P>\n","<P>25    I cannot quote it verbatim right now, but I'm absolutely sure it existed.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","\n","\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    And according to this piece of legislation, even if the majority of</P>\n","<P> 2    members could not meet, the Presidency under certain circumstances would</P>\n","<P> 3    continue working with the members who were present.</P>\n","<P> 4            Let me remind you that in the spring of 1991 or in the early</P>\n","<P> 5    summer, there was a vote taken to declare a imminent threat of war.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 65 it says:  \"On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,</P>\n","<P> 7    Slobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal</P>\n","<P> 8    enterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from</P>\n","<P> 9    Belgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the</P>\n","<P>10    mobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay</P>\n","<P>11    in Yugoslavia.\"</P>\n","<P>12            First of all, let's establish when I began advocating a unitary</P>\n","<P>13    Serb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And</P>\n","<P>14    secondly, was this anyone's idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,</P>\n","<P>15    and is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever</P>\n","<P>16    been a unitary state?</P>\n","<P>17       A.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as</P>\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally</P>\n","<P>19    and your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt</P>\n","<P>20    the new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the</P>\n","<P>21    autonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the</P>\n","<P>22    Serb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of</P>\n","<P>23    autonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an</P>\n","<P>24    option.</P>\n","<P>25            Furthermore, when the four former federal units had already been</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    recognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the</P>\n","<P> 2    Montenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be</P>\n","<P> 3    promulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump</P>\n","<P> 4    Yugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would</P>\n","<P> 5    have been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -</P>\n","<P> 6    because that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary</P>\n","<P> 7    Serbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this</P>\n","<P> 8    but didn't want to, and I am sorry that you didn't do that, because up to</P>\n","<P> 9    the point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --</P>\n","<P>10    in Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It</P>\n","<P>11    appeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any</P>\n","<P>13    of my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who</P>\n","<P>14    were allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had</P>\n","<P>15    any kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated</P>\n","<P>17    with you advocated such an idea.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it</P>\n","<P>19    says here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of</P>\n","<P>20    reservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the</P>\n","<P>21    reasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was</P>\n","<P>22    called for?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   I'm not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation</P>\n","<P>24    of reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to</P>\n","<P>25    mobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    to take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the</P>\n","<P> 2    territorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that</P>\n","<P> 3    this mobilisation didn't go well.  The response was very poor, because</P>\n","<P> 4    Veljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn't want to remove the</P>\n","<P> 5    communist insignia from the military uniforms.</P>\n","<P> 6            The Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the</P>\n","<P> 7    Presidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was</P>\n","<P> 8    Prime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in</P>\n","<P> 9    Slovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of</P>\n","<P>10    such an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops</P>\n","<P>11    into Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then</P>\n","<P>12    leadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as</P>\n","<P>13    I know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership</P>\n","<P>14    which had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your</P>\n","<P>16    name, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask</P>\n","<P>17    you now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of</P>\n","<P>18    April, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan's and</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you</P>\n","<P>20    know anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and</P>\n","<P>21    cart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of</P>\n","<P>22    cooperation with Arkan's volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>24    did not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert</P>\n","<P>25    that, I'm saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    organised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as</P>\n","<P> 2    much as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.</P>\n","<P> 3    That's a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P> 4    Radical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty</P>\n","<P> 5    to Serbia.  I guarantee that.</P>\n","<P> 6            The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict</P>\n","<P> 7    instructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb</P>\n","<P> 8    volunteer guard up to the --</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm asking why was that instruction given to the</P>\n","<P>10    volunteers of the Serb Radical Party?</P>\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.</P>\n","<P>12    We didn't want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn't</P>\n","<P>13    want people's awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.</P>\n","<P>14            As I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,</P>\n","<P>15    long before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had</P>\n","<P>16    quarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was</P>\n","<P>17    in danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this</P>\n","<P>18    in the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding</P>\n","<P>20    that instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with</P>\n","<P>21    Arkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You're</P>\n","<P>22    not there with them.</P>\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can't say that not a single</P>\n","<P>24    volunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There's one</P>\n","<P>25    instance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    teacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 2    Party.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of</P>\n","<P> 3    about 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back</P>\n","<P> 4    but, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of</P>\n","<P> 5    Arkan's men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.</P>\n","<P> 6            So, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint</P>\n","<P> 7    military activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with</P>\n","<P> 8    Arkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a</P>\n","<P> 9    distance from Arkan.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.</P>\n","<P>11            Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on</P>\n","<P>14    transcript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia</P>\n","<P>15    took place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj's</P>\n","<P>16    White Eagles.</P>\n","<P>17            First of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and</P>\n","<P>18    secondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj's White Eagles?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb</P>\n","<P>20    people organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have</P>\n","<P>21    already said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of</P>\n","<P>22    volunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After</P>\n","<P>23    that, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we</P>\n","<P>24    had volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never</P>\n","<P>25    had anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            There was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo</P>\n","<P> 2    Selo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he</P>\n","<P> 3    was killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not</P>\n","<P> 4    carrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no</P>\n","<P> 5    joint military activities.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Let's clarify this.  It doesn't say here that you cooperated.  It</P>\n","<P> 7    says here:  \"With infiltration of Seselj's White Eagles.\"  So the White</P>\n","<P> 8    Eagles are being ascribed to you.</P>\n","<P> 9       A.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the</P>\n","<P>10    Prosecutor bringing witnesses here who don't no anything about what</P>\n","<P>11    happened on the ground.  It's simply nonsense to talk of a group called</P>\n","<P>12    Seselj's White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and</P>\n","<P>13    the Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn't know</P>\n","<P>14    what he was talking about.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,</P>\n","<P>16    2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that \"Seselj collected men in</P>\n","<P>17    Erdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia.\"  Is that</P>\n","<P>18    true, Mr. Seselj?</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493</P>\n","<P>20    who testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake</P>\n","<P>22    in my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that</P>\n","<P>23    particular page, and the page is 19003.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    them to Bosnia?</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in</P>\n","<P> 3    Erdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,</P>\n","<P> 4    nicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only</P>\n","<P> 5    time.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --</P>\n","<P> 6    we never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there</P>\n","<P> 7    either, and I can state that quite categorically.</P>\n","<P> 8            The people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the</P>\n","<P> 9    war and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were</P>\n","<P>10    exclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I</P>\n","<P>11    absolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan's centre in Erdut</P>\n","<P>12    later on.  We never had anything to do with it.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is</P>\n","<P>14    20294, says that Arkan's and Seselj's men shot above the heads of the</P>\n","<P>15    civilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in</P>\n","<P>16    Bratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who</P>\n","<P>17    mistreated and abused the civilians?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian</P>\n","<P>19    Radical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my</P>\n","<P>20    knowledge Arkan didn't appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in</P>\n","<P>21    Zvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in</P>\n","<P>22    Bratunac either.  And I've already said that in Bratunac there was</P>\n","<P>23    Deronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there</P>\n","<P>24    I was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have</P>\n","<P>25    very certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj's men were</P>\n","<P> 2    in Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 3    mean there is no difference, says he.</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can't see any</P>\n","<P> 5    difference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the</P>\n","<P> 6    White Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at</P>\n","<P> 7    all.  And that's not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some</P>\n","<P> 8    judgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to</P>\n","<P> 9    see in some other places Seselj's White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the</P>\n","<P>10    problem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses</P>\n","<P>11    which it manipulates.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on</P>\n","<P>13    several occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --</P>\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven't been able to check this myself</P>\n","<P>15    because the accused hasn't been getting the references correct, and it's</P>\n","<P>16    quite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I'm grateful to</P>\n","<P>17    Ms. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came</P>\n","<P>18    (redacted).</P>\n","<P>19    But, really, I'm afraid we've got to have correct references for the</P>\n","<P>20    witnesses.  We can't simply just go to the page in the transcript.</P>\n","<P>21    Frequently our page numbers don't necessarily coincide here in court, and</P>\n","<P>22    without reference to the witnesses it's very difficult to pick it up</P>\n","<P>23    later.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in</P>\n","<P>25    pinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you're referring.  Now,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Judge Kwon has already corrected you once, and apparently there is another</P>\n","<P> 2    mistake in the reference.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, perhaps there might be a</P>\n","<P> 4    mistake with the name, but there is no mistake with the quotation from the</P>\n","<P> 5    transcript, and my question relates to the material facts which are being</P>\n","<P> 6    mentioned here.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, we have to follow it, Mr. Milosevic.  There</P>\n","<P> 8    is duty on you to be more careful.</P>\n","<P> 9            Please proceed.</P>\n","<P>10            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. Robinson.  And I'll</P>\n","<P>11    check this out to see whether indeed it is the same witness from</P>\n","<P>12    page 20352, the transcript line and page, the quotation that I mentioned</P>\n","<P>13    earlier on or, rather, 20351 is the exact number.  I'll check that out</P>\n","<P>14    during the break.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript</P>\n","<P>17    said that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of</P>\n","<P>18    March, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan's men took part as well as</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the</P>\n","<P>20    occupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on</P>\n","<P>21    the 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of</P>\n","<P>22    your volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What</P>\n","<P>24    happened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between</P>\n","<P>25    the JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Muslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.</P>\n","<P> 2    However, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went</P>\n","<P> 3    on for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting</P>\n","<P> 4    the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was</P>\n","<P> 5    there, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my</P>\n","<P> 6    knowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of</P>\n","<P> 7    the local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to</P>\n","<P> 8    establish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the</P>\n","<P> 9    ground there.</P>\n","<P>10            I know -- have reliable information that the commands and the</P>\n","<P>11    officers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan's and</P>\n","<P>12    the Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a</P>\n","<P>13    great deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very</P>\n","<P>14    rarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.</P>\n","<P>15            As far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,</P>\n","<P>16    over there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did</P>\n","<P>17    appear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the</P>\n","<P>18    call of Biljana Plavsic.  I can't prove that, but I do know that Biljana</P>\n","<P>19    Plavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly</P>\n","<P>20    meeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The</P>\n","<P>21    volunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina</P>\n","<P>22    were not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the</P>\n","<P>23    Serbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were</P>\n","<P>24    residents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the</P>\n","<P>25    conflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    and Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan's right-hand man.  And in</P>\n","<P> 2    Serbia we didn't send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something</P>\n","<P> 4    for me in relation to the Prosecution's case.  In the Bosnia indictment</P>\n","<P> 5    the allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other</P>\n","<P> 6    members of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the</P>\n","<P> 7    Prosecution case unfolded, you're not saying, are you, that he acted</P>\n","<P> 8    alone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with</P>\n","<P> 9    other members of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven't reviewed each and every allegation</P>\n","<P>11    to check that there isn't one there that may be susceptible to individual</P>\n","<P>12    perpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he's working with others.</P>\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually</P>\n","<P>16    your case.  It's not that he acted alone.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. NICE:  Subject to the point I've just made.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you've made, yes.</P>\n","<P>19            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Very well, Mr. Seselj.  You've just heard that explanation too.</P>\n","<P>23    Now, since you know the relationships very well between people at that</P>\n","<P>24    time, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and</P>\n","<P>25    Zvornik yourself.  Now, did I or any organs of power and authority have</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","\n","\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    anything to do with Arkan's volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and</P>\n","<P> 4    I think perhaps there's this qualification, although I don't think it is a</P>\n","<P> 5    qualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this</P>\n","<P> 6    accused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top</P>\n","<P> 7    political level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are</P>\n","<P> 8    criminal in nature.  It's the standard method of generation of</P>\n","<P> 9    genocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar</P>\n","<P>10    [phoen].</P>\n","<P>11            Now, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other</P>\n","<P>12    people.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may</P>\n","<P>13    be minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in</P>\n","<P>14    those circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting</P>\n","<P>15    alone in certain circumstances, but that's the only qualification I think</P>\n","<P>16    I should make.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it's a point that will warrant some</P>\n","<P>18    consideration later on, yes.</P>\n","<P>19            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>20            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   So Arkan is mentioned here as well as Mauzer.  Did I or anybody</P>\n","<P>22    else from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all</P>\n","<P>23    and with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   I'm quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.</P>\n","<P>25    On the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    contacts with Arkan.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many</P>\n","<P> 3    questions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the</P>\n","<P> 4    evidence he's giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,</P>\n","<P> 5    how is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan</P>\n","<P> 6    or Mauzer?</P>\n","<P> 7            He's giving evidence.  He's saying that you had nothing to do with</P>\n","<P> 8    him.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to</P>\n","<P> 9    establish how he's in a position to make that statement.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that</P>\n","<P>12    cannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from</P>\n","<P>13    the authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or</P>\n","<P>14    relationship with Arkan or Mauzer?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   In Belgrade you couldn't hide anything like that.  It would be</P>\n","<P>16    impossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is</P>\n","<P>17    that kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become</P>\n","<P>18    public.</P>\n","<P>19            Second, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts</P>\n","<P>20    only with Zoran Djindjic.  And I've already spoken about the relationship</P>\n","<P>21    between Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic's vice-president and the</P>\n","<P>22    president of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his</P>\n","<P>23    pre-electoral campaign.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   Let's clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did</P>\n","<P>25    you have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    able to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in</P>\n","<P> 2    Bijeljina?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina</P>\n","<P> 4    sufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,</P>\n","<P> 5    including Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this</P>\n","<P> 6    trial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events</P>\n","<P> 7    that went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in</P>\n","<P> 8    Bijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements</P>\n","<P> 9    and held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and</P>\n","<P>10    severely criticised Mauzer's conduct, especially Mauzer's conduct towards</P>\n","<P>11    the Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am</P>\n","<P>12    preparing them for my own trial, which doesn't seem to be starting.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack</P>\n","<P>14    on the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the</P>\n","<P>15    JNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by</P>\n","<P>16    the Red Berets or, rather, Arkan's and Seselj's men.  So that's the</P>\n","<P>17    quotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan's</P>\n","<P>18    and Seselj's men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red</P>\n","<P>19    Berets were they?  What Arkan's men were they, Seselj's men were they</P>\n","<P>20    around Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the</P>\n","<P>22    witness don't seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened</P>\n","<P>23    to see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red</P>\n","<P>24    cap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.</P>\n","<P>25    And then he -- the witness doesn't know whether they were Seselj's men or</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Arkan's men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it's</P>\n","<P> 2    highly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of</P>\n","<P> 3    his head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify</P>\n","<P> 4    so-called Seselj's men and Arkan's men and these alleged Red Berets.</P>\n","<P> 5            As for the Red Berets, I've already given you reliable facts about</P>\n","<P> 6    them and said that name appeared in different situations relating to</P>\n","<P> 7    different military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina</P>\n","<P> 8    area where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then</P>\n","<P> 9    the army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of</P>\n","<P>10    the intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until</P>\n","<P>11    the special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of</P>\n","<P>12    Serbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this</P>\n","<P>13    misunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed</P>\n","<P>14    to people with -- which they had nothing to do with.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the</P>\n","<P>16    following:  \"Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P>17    who were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done.\"</P>\n","<P>18    That's when this witness claims.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He's a colonel by</P>\n","<P>20    rank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff</P>\n","<P>21    of the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the</P>\n","<P>22    number two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that's the same</P>\n","<P>23    Osman Selak that you're referring to.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   Well, I can't tell you that.</P>\n","<P>25       A.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a</P>\n","<P> 2    statement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,</P>\n","<P> 3    what the circumstances were in which I said it.</P>\n","<P> 4            I did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the</P>\n","<P> 5    secession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia</P>\n","<P> 6    seceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,</P>\n","<P> 7    and for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he</P>\n","<P> 8    personally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.</P>\n","<P> 9            As far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from</P>\n","<P>10    Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of</P>\n","<P>11    Yugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and</P>\n","<P>12    Raska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of</P>\n","<P>13    examples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army</P>\n","<P>14    perform their duty very honourably.</P>\n","<P>15            So the citizens --</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are</P>\n","<P>18    saying that you did make such a statement or you didn't make such a</P>\n","<P>19    statement.</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if</P>\n","<P>21    you don't show me something like that here, where and when.  Let us see</P>\n","<P>22    the statement concerned.  Let me identify it.  I gave thousands and</P>\n","<P>23    thousands of statements in public.  They were publicly recorded.  They</P>\n","<P>24    were published.  So let's see.</P>\n","<P>25            My objection is precisely in that.  Why did this Osman Selak not</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    say where and when?</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's helpful to some extent.  Does it follow from</P>\n","<P> 3    the answer you've just given that you could have said it?</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I could have said it along the</P>\n","<P> 5    following lines, that those in the army who came from the renegade</P>\n","<P> 6    republics in principle should not remain at positions in the Yugoslav</P>\n","<P> 7    army.  You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live</P>\n","<P> 8    in Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in</P>\n","<P> 9    the army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as</P>\n","<P>10    officers?</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's simply confusing me further.  The quote was</P>\n","<P>12    that you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims</P>\n","<P>13    and Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that</P>\n","<P>14    you could possibly have made that statement in these terms?</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not saying that I made that kind</P>\n","<P>16    of statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak</P>\n","<P>17    testified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise</P>\n","<P>18    lines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman</P>\n","<P>19    Selak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be</P>\n","<P>20    established.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the</P>\n","<P>21    Prosecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly</P>\n","<P>22    what I said.</P>\n","<P>23            I am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,</P>\n","<P>24    but it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you're asking me to do is</P>\n","<P>25    to comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Selak's view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make</P>\n","<P> 2    my statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm</P>\n","<P> 4    trying to understand the answer you've given to the question asked by</P>\n","<P> 5    Mr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you've just said, the problem is</P>\n","<P> 6    that you've been studying this yourself, and you're trying to justify a</P>\n","<P> 7    position of your own without really dealing specifically with the question</P>\n","<P> 8    that's being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears</P>\n","<P> 9    now to be that you couldn't possibly have made a statement of that nature,</P>\n","<P>10    although you might have said something much more specific about different</P>\n","<P>11    people but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.</P>\n","<P>12            Now, is that a fair summary of your position?</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I'm not sure, by think you're</P>\n","<P>14    very close.  However, in order to help you, I'm going to give you an</P>\n","<P>15    example.</P>\n","<P>16            Throughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were</P>\n","<P>17    informed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,</P>\n","<P>18    escaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of</P>\n","<P>19    confidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998</P>\n","<P>20    we had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of</P>\n","<P>21    the military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his</P>\n","<P>22    family abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives</P>\n","<P>23    there.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn't remotely sound as if it's</P>\n","<P>25    going to be at all helpful to me, so we'll proceed with Mr. Milosevic's</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    questions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you</P>\n","<P> 2    was about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist</P>\n","<P> 3    statement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple</P>\n","<P> 4    issue I'm not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further</P>\n","<P> 5    if he wishes.</P>\n","<P> 6            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in</P>\n","<P>11    no uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that</P>\n","<P>12    any statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never</P>\n","<P>13    in my life have I made a racist statement.</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>\n","<P>19            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  There's nothing for you to respond to.</P>\n","<P>21            Mr. Milosevic, the next question.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I'm afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I</P>\n","<P>24    put a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific</P>\n","<P>25    terms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    here that \"Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 2    who were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed.\"  Did you ever state</P>\n","<P> 3    that?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I didn't say it that way.</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   So you didn't say it that way --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... matter.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  And why on earth it should take all this time to</P>\n","<P> 8    establish that simple issue, I do not know.</P>\n","<P> 9            Perhaps it would help, Mr. Seselj, if you just listened to the</P>\n","<P>10    questions and answer the question that's actually asked rather than try to</P>\n","<P>11    make political statements about your own position.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic --</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not making political statements,</P>\n","<P>14    Mr. Bonomy.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He</P>\n","<P>17    mentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether</P>\n","<P>18    those facts are correct.  And first of all, I'm interested in the</P>\n","<P>19    circumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  \"Just after</P>\n","<P>20    the bombing Seselj came to Pale.\"  And then on page 26762 he</P>\n","<P>21    says:  \"Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to</P>\n","<P>22    support the Bosnian Serbs.\"  These are a few facts that referred to.</P>\n","<P>23    Could you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this</P>\n","<P>24    actually all about?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the</P>\n","<P> 2    leadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly</P>\n","<P> 3    engaged in an anti-Serb policy.</P>\n","<P> 4            As for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market</P>\n","<P> 5    itself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the</P>\n","<P> 6    street of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these</P>\n","<P> 7    are explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of</P>\n","<P> 8    whether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar</P>\n","<P> 9    shells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.</P>\n","<P>10            This was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the</P>\n","<P>11    Serbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the</P>\n","<P>12    threats that were made, and so on and so forth.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there</P>\n","<P>14    you did so only to give political support to the leadership of</P>\n","<P>15    Republika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and</P>\n","<P>16    bombing.</P>\n","<P>17       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  \"In January or February</P>\n","<P>19    1992\" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, \"Arkan's</P>\n","<P>20    and Seselj's units arrived in Doboj.\"</P>\n","<P>21            Is this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?</P>\n","<P>22       A.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,</P>\n","<P>23    there were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.</P>\n","<P>24            Secondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to</P>\n","<P>25    Doboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan's Tigers never</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    operated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to</P>\n","<P> 3    this question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript page 27738, quite explicitly, \"Mirko Blagojevic,\" that is to</P>\n","<P> 5    say, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he</P>\n","<P> 6    says:  \"Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,</P>\n","<P> 7    and he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with</P>\n","<P> 8    Seselj.\"</P>\n","<P> 9            I am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>10    Party or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that</P>\n","<P>11    Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So</P>\n","<P>12    please deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the</P>\n","<P>13    transcript.  Is it correct or not?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is</P>\n","<P>15    organised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A</P>\n","<P>16    conflict occurs when two armed formations clash.</P>\n","<P>17            Mirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in</P>\n","<P>18    Bijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim</P>\n","<P>19    formations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any</P>\n","<P>20    conflicts.  And I guarantee with my own life that he took part in no</P>\n","<P>21    looting, no persecutions, no maltreatment of the civilian population and</P>\n","<P>22    so on and so forth.  I'm absolutely certain of that.</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Thank you.</P>\n","<P>24       A.   I can fully identify with everything that Mirko Blagojevic did.</P>\n","<P>25    It is to that degree that I'm certain that he never did anything against</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","\n","\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the law.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  \"Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 3    men tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm.\"</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   My understanding is it's somewhere near Zvornik.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   That's quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 7    Party took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there</P>\n","<P> 8    in brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on</P>\n","<P> 9    for a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the</P>\n","<P>10    Muslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to</P>\n","<P>11    an end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>12    withdrew.</P>\n","<P>13            I preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on</P>\n","<P>14    guarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing</P>\n","<P>15    happened, I would have had to know about it.</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you</P>\n","<P>17    personally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following</P>\n","<P>18    circumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  \"Seselj,</P>\n","<P>19    on Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired</P>\n","<P>20    it at Muslims in Sarajevo.\"  This was shown on television, and he said</P>\n","<P>21    that you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at</P>\n","<P>23    Grbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called</P>\n","<P>24    international observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go</P>\n","<P>25    around the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Serb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was</P>\n","<P> 2    an apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I</P>\n","<P> 3    used a Browning machine-gun from there.  It's a heavy machine-gun.  I</P>\n","<P> 4    couldn't carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry</P>\n","<P> 5    it around.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   You cannot carry it.  It's too long.  It was installed in that</P>\n","<P> 8    building, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches</P>\n","<P> 9    below the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of</P>\n","<P>10    the volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was</P>\n","<P>11    firing from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and</P>\n","<P>12    the top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is</P>\n","<P>13    something I don't know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who</P>\n","<P>14    could have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this</P>\n","<P>15    small participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.</P>\n","<P>16            A Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that</P>\n","<P>17    case, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been</P>\n","<P>18    forced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of</P>\n","<P>19    those who in violation of international law of war brought him out there</P>\n","<P>20    to dig trenches, not those who --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,</P>\n","<P>24    that at the beginning of April Seselj's men arrived in the area of</P>\n","<P>25    Bratunac and Zvornik.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic's part.  He knows</P>\n","<P> 2    full well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing</P>\n","<P> 3    who he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and</P>\n","<P> 4    making this sweeping statement Seselj's men arrived in Bratunac and</P>\n","<P> 5    Zvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it's as if they were in Bratunac</P>\n","<P> 6    too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so</P>\n","<P> 7    Deronjic invented that.</P>\n","<P> 8            In Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the</P>\n","<P> 9    Bratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was</P>\n","<P>10    commander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he</P>\n","<P>11    was not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,</P>\n","<P>12    then a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.  I think the interpreter is having</P>\n","<P>14    some difficulty.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will.</P>\n","<P>16            You could have noticed, Mr. Robinson, that I have been trying as</P>\n","<P>17    of late to speak slowly, but sometimes, every now and then, I may forget</P>\n","<P>18    what you cautioned me about.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, I had noticed, and the -- we are</P>\n","<P>20    appreciative of the effort you are making.  You have answered the</P>\n","<P>21    question.</P>\n","<P>22            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the meantime --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think you have answered that question.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   So they were not in Bratunac at all?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in</P>\n","<P> 2    Bratunac.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   All right.  So you are saying that he's not telling the truth.</P>\n","<P> 4            The same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not</P>\n","<P> 5    agree that Seselj was a true opposition.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   The Hague OTP and Judge Schomburg on several occasions caught</P>\n","<P> 7    Deronjic lying.  And even in Deronjic's judgement you can find about seven</P>\n","<P> 8    different points as ascertained by Judge Schomburg, namely that Deronjic</P>\n","<P> 9    was lying.</P>\n","<P>10            Secondly, in the case of people who are inclined to a pro-Western</P>\n","<P>11    policy or are mercenaries of Western intelligence agencies, or in order to</P>\n","<P>12    save their own skin they go into plea bargaining with the OTP and</P>\n","<P>13    therefore appear as witnesses in the trials of other people, it can often</P>\n","<P>14    be heard that those who are really opposition but are not prepared to</P>\n","<P>15    serve the West --</P>\n","<P>16            MR. NICE:  I'm not sure this is responsive to any question --</P>\n","<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Are you interrupting me?</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet, Mr. Seselj, and he's</P>\n","<P>19    entitled to make an objection if he wishes.</P>\n","<P>20            MR. NICE:  He was simply asked if the man was telling the truth.</P>\n","<P>21    We have his answer and he's now gone on to a long comment basically.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, you have moved into the area of comment.</P>\n","<P>23            It's now time for the break.</P>\n","<P>24            Mr. Nice, I should say the question that I asked earlier related</P>\n","<P>25    to the Bosnia indictment.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            We will break for 20 minutes.</P>\n","<P> 2                          --- Recess taken at 3.41 p.m.</P>\n","<P> 3                          --- On resuming at 4.08 p.m.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, you told me to check</P>\n","<P> 6    the pages that Mr. Nice mentioned, 35 -- 20352 and 20351, that is.  This</P>\n","<P> 7    was Witness 1070.</P>\n","<P> 8            On page 20351 he says that Seselj's men were in Bratunac and that</P>\n","<P> 9    there was no difference between them and Seselj's men, the White Eagles,</P>\n","<P>10    that is.</P>\n","<P>11            And on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April</P>\n","<P>12    Seselj's and Arkan's men were in Bratunac together when some people were</P>\n","<P>13    deported.  And Mr. Seselj answered questions about this.  In the meantime,</P>\n","<P>14    the liaison officer had the transcript, and I have received a note saying</P>\n","<P>15    that both references are correct, both as regards page 20351 and 20352,</P>\n","<P>16    and these refer to Witness 1070.  There was no error.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  All right, Mr. Milosevic.  We'll do our own</P>\n","<P>18    check.  Thank you for checking anyhow.</P>\n","<P>19            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   Mr. Seselj, this is the testimony of Miroslav Deronjic, who said</P>\n","<P>21    that you were not truly an opposition politician or, rather, that you</P>\n","<P>22    cooperated with the government and that therefore this idea of a joint</P>\n","<P>23    criminal enterprise is thereby confirmed.  Were you in the opposition or</P>\n","<P>24    not?</P>\n","<P>25            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it</P>\n","<P> 2    on.</P>\n","<P> 3            Both the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time</P>\n","<P> 4    were distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as</P>\n","<P> 5    it's possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by</P>\n","<P> 6    Deronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the</P>\n","<P> 7    opposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint</P>\n","<P> 8    often expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various</P>\n","<P> 9    government and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person</P>\n","<P>10    of the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or</P>\n","<P>11    Miles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery</P>\n","<P>12    and so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while</P>\n","<P>13    criticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition</P>\n","<P>14    politicians, and this logic is completely upside down.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Witness Ahmet Zulic says, and that's on page 30000 of the</P>\n","<P>17    transcript, he says that Seselj's men were stationed in the partisan</P>\n","<P>18    cemetery in Pobrezje, that doesn't matter so much but what matters is the</P>\n","<P>19    following, that they had come there to kill the Muslims.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Where is this place?  Pobrezje?  Where is it?</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   I have a note here in Pobrezje.  I can't be more specific than</P>\n","<P>22    that.</P>\n","<P>23            But let me put a question to you:  Did your volunteers go anywhere</P>\n","<P>24    to kill all Muslims?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   No.  Nowhere did the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party go to</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    kill Muslims or Croats or any kind of civilians.  Wherever they went, they</P>\n","<P> 2    were part of the JNA, and they went there to fight against the</P>\n","<P> 3    paramilitary units that wanted to break up Yugoslavia.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, it's important to know the</P>\n","<P> 5    location.  I'm not sure whether Mr. Nice or Mr. Kay can help.  Your note</P>\n","<P> 6    doesn't identify clearly the name of this place?</P>\n","<P> 7            MR. NICE:  I tried to make an electronic search but for various</P>\n","<P> 8    reasons it doesn't work at the moment or doesn't work for this witness on</P>\n","<P> 9    this particular part of his evidence.  I'll try again.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  You said Pobrezje.</P>\n","<P>12            Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   The same witness, Ahmet Zulic, on page 30047, says in Sanski Most</P>\n","<P>15    there was no fighting, but the civilians fled because Seselj's men were</P>\n","<P>16    there.</P>\n","<P>17            Your men caused fear among civilians, although there was no</P>\n","<P>18    fighting there, as he says, in Sanski Most.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,</P>\n","<P>20    throughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did</P>\n","<P>21    not fight in any location.</P>\n","<P>22            This reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a</P>\n","<P>23    certain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying</P>\n","<P>24    that sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.</P>\n","<P>25    Somebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    arriving, and he spread panic.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that the Serbian word for</P>\n","<P> 3    sugar resembles Mr. Seselj's name.</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere</P>\n","<P> 5    in that area.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  \"From the</P>\n","<P> 8    1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan</P>\n","<P> 9    Milosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint</P>\n","<P>10    criminal,\" and so on,\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise</P>\n","<P>11    aided and abetted,\" and so on and so forth, all these phrases, \"the</P>\n","<P>12    planning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories</P>\n","<P>13    of Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>\n","<P>14    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.\"</P>\n","<P>15            Tell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in</P>\n","<P>16    this joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged</P>\n","<P>17    crimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made</P>\n","<P>18    here?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from</P>\n","<P>20    Serbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia</P>\n","<P>21    and Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted</P>\n","<P>22    to proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the</P>\n","<P>23    will of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the</P>\n","<P>24    West who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or</P>\n","<P>25    execution or extermination.  There was no plan.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            When the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in</P>\n","<P> 2    many places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only</P>\n","<P> 3    where the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats</P>\n","<P> 4    were in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,</P>\n","<P> 5    not a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the</P>\n","<P> 6    majority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They</P>\n","<P> 7    had already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we</P>\n","<P> 9    have already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the</P>\n","<P>10    other places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>\n","<P>11    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in</P>\n","<P>12    any kind of military activities?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in</P>\n","<P>14    January, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but</P>\n","<P>15    the UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,</P>\n","<P>16    although they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was</P>\n","<P>17    established, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be</P>\n","\n","<P>18    disarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.</P>\n","<P>19            The Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian</P>\n","<P>20    villages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there</P>\n","<P>21    were two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active</P>\n","<P>22    in the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces</P>\n","<P>23    in the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the</P>\n","<P>24    only activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica</P>\n","<P>25    area.  It was in the beginning of 1993.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            As for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,</P>\n","<P> 2    I don't know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up</P>\n","<P> 3    only in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all</P>\n","<P> 4    over Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army</P>\n","<P> 5    of the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska</P>\n","<P> 6    Krajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his</P>\n","<P> 7    volunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars</P>\n","<P> 8    there, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed</P>\n","<P>10    and what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy</P>\n","<P>11    that we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in</P>\n","<P>12    whole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and</P>\n","<P>13    Herzegovina?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and</P>\n","<P>15    there was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen</P>\n","<P>16    happened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on</P>\n","<P>17    their own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit</P>\n","<P>18    murders or anything of the kind.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war</P>\n","<P>20    in Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the</P>\n","<P>21    other participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by</P>\n","<P>22    Mr. Nice.</P>\n","<P>23            Look at paragraph 33.  We've just been discussing paragraph 32.  I</P>\n","<P>24    won't read the beginning of paragraph 33 because it's the same:  \"From on</P>\n","<P>25    or about the 1st of March, 1992,\" and so on and so forth, and then it</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    says:  \"On the territory of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa,</P>\n","<P> 2    Bosanski Novi, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Sarajevo (Ilijas), Kljuc,</P>\n","<P> 3    Kalinovik, Kotor Varos, Nevesinje, Sarajevo, Novi Grad, Sarajevo, Novo</P>\n","<P> 4    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Rudo, Sanski Most, Srebrenica</P>\n","<P> 5    again, Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\"  Please --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You are finished reading that list.  Let me</P>\n","<P> 7    remind you, Mr. Milosevic, that the Rule 98 bis decision found that there</P>\n","<P> 8    was not enough evidence to support the allegation in paragraph 32 in</P>\n","<P> 9    relation to some of the villages or municipalities mentioned.  In fact, as</P>\n","<P>10    far as paragraph 32 is concerned, you need only concern yourself with</P>\n","<P>11    Brcko, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Bijeljina, Kotor Varos, Kljuc,</P>\n","<P>12    Bosanski Novi.  And I am checking to see whether the decision affected</P>\n","<P>13    paragraph 33.</P>\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, could you please let</P>\n","<P>15    me know what evidence, as you say there was no evidence for these places,</P>\n","<P>16    but what was the evidence that Mr. Nice presented here about the other</P>\n","<P>17    places linking me --</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.  Mr. Milosevic, the Rule 98 bis</P>\n","<P>19    decision was published and was available to you.  But I bring that to your</P>\n","<P>20    attention so we don't waste time.  And I'll ask the legal officer to give</P>\n","<P>21    me the information in relation to paragraph 33.</P>\n","<P>22            Go ahead, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>23            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   As I was saying, Mr. Seselj, I read out a list here.  It's a long</P>\n","<P>25    paragraph with all the names of the towns where I, together with others,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","\n","\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    am charged with working for the extermination of Muslims and Croats.  You</P>\n","<P> 2    know the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that</P>\n","<P> 3    referred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded</P>\n","<P> 4    in any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted</P>\n","<P> 6    to, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A</P>\n","<P> 7    civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally</P>\n","<P> 8    wanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a</P>\n","<P> 9    constituent people.</P>\n","<P>10            And the question arises from there where are the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>11    Mostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>12    Travnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>13    many other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats</P>\n","<P>14    during that civil war?</P>\n","<P>15            After the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the</P>\n","<P>16    population, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did</P>\n","<P>17    take place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,</P>\n","<P>18    in figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I</P>\n","<P>19    can put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes</P>\n","<P>20    crimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,</P>\n","<P>21    sometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,</P>\n","<P>22    criminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and</P>\n","<P>23    revenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes</P>\n","<P>24    did not exist.  That did not happen.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    joint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I'd like</P>\n","<P> 2    to draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of</P>\n","<P> 3    December, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33</P>\n","<P> 4    and indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns</P>\n","<P> 5    are repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns</P>\n","<P> 6    too.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.</P>\n","<P> 7            So what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during</P>\n","<P> 8    that period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of</P>\n","<P> 9    December 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring</P>\n","<P>10    Bosnia and Herzegovina?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia</P>\n","<P>12    or, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of</P>\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It</P>\n","<P>14    did not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help</P>\n","<P>15    materially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs</P>\n","<P>16    living over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different</P>\n","<P>17    political relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership</P>\n","<P>18    of Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in</P>\n","<P>19    which those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep</P>\n","<P>20    conflicts, and they didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues.</P>\n","<P>21            So throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the</P>\n","<P>22    indictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,</P>\n","<P>23    the leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered</P>\n","<P>24    in looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far</P>\n","<P>25    accepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    attacked ourselves for our part.</P>\n","<P> 2            So I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy</P>\n","<P> 3    dating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact</P>\n","<P> 4    that that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all</P>\n","<P> 5    costs.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no</P>\n","<P> 6    alternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at</P>\n","<P> 7    the price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept</P>\n","<P> 8    because they were not able to take such great concessions.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities</P>\n","<P>10    of that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these</P>\n","<P>11    towns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I</P>\n","<P>12    personally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,</P>\n","<P>13    et cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason</P>\n","<P>14    explanation?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Yes, I do, and that's explanation is the following and the fact</P>\n","<P>16    that through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,</P>\n","<P>17    and --</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not</P>\n","<P>19    an explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.</P>\n","<P>20            So please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,</P>\n","<P>23    Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac</P>\n","<P>24    again, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in</P>\n","<P>25    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with</P>\n","<P> 2    regard to that point of the indictment?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised</P>\n","<P> 4    crime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don't know whether in all the</P>\n","<P> 5    places enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took</P>\n","<P> 6    place in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each</P>\n","<P> 7    individual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the</P>\n","<P> 8    motives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are</P>\n","<P> 9    still living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can</P>\n","<P>10    be established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side</P>\n","<P>11    and the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to</P>\n","<P>12    investigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to</P>\n","<P>13    strike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the</P>\n","<P>14    number of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you've said when you said</P>\n","<P>16    that some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let's look at</P>\n","<P>17    that for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of</P>\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or</P>\n","<P>19    formations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes</P>\n","<P>20    that you know of?  Are there any links?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of</P>\n","<P>22    power and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as</P>\n","<P>23    well, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,</P>\n","<P>24    the Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the</P>\n","<P>25    Academy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    everybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out</P>\n","<P> 2    against them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for</P>\n","<P> 3    freedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were</P>\n","<P> 4    being perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes</P>\n","<P> 5    should be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind</P>\n","<P> 6    via the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political</P>\n","<P> 7    parties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which</P>\n","<P> 8    strove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors</P>\n","<P> 9    spoke out against crimes.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>11            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Now, we -- let's look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful</P>\n","<P>13    confinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,</P>\n","<P>14    Bosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the</P>\n","<P>15    territories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,</P>\n","<P>16    Samac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,</P>\n","<P>17    Kotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,</P>\n","<P>18    Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>19            Tell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these</P>\n","<P>20    people in these towns did we take part in?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have</P>\n","<P>22    had anything to do with any such thing.</P>\n","<P>23            First of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What</P>\n","<P>24    the confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of</P>\n","<P>25    civilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    unlawful, and there were such cases.</P>\n","<P> 2            Now, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of</P>\n","<P> 3    all, there were individual instances in some of these places through the</P>\n","<P> 4    self-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance</P>\n","<P> 5    of Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.</P>\n","<P> 6    And then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of</P>\n","<P> 7    their own because they couldn't influence him.  He appeared as a factor,</P>\n","<P> 8    and there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his</P>\n","<P> 9    motives were of a criminal nature.</P>\n","<P>10            There were other such cases in some of these places whereby</P>\n","<P>11    somebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in</P>\n","<P>12    order to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive</P>\n","<P>13    money and then release them once they received money for that.  There were</P>\n","<P>14    also instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,</P>\n","<P>15    somebody's family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or</P>\n","<P>16    Croats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often</P>\n","<P>17    were not able to prevent revenge of that kind.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Which authorities?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian</P>\n","<P>21    authorities intervene?</P>\n","<P>22       A.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn't influence or involve</P>\n","<P>23    themselves in any such matters.</P>\n","<P>24            So as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one</P>\n","<P>25    should take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    those cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and</P>\n","<P> 2    what the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.</P>\n","<P> 3            Now, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places</P>\n","<P> 4    where possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of</P>\n","<P> 5    context and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse</P>\n","<P> 6    top-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian</P>\n","<P> 7    Yugoslavia as well.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has</P>\n","<P> 9    become a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you</P>\n","<P>10    say that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing</P>\n","<P>11    like the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged</P>\n","<P>12    by the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn't understand me correctly,</P>\n","<P>14    Mr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,</P>\n","<P>15    but there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top</P>\n","<P>16    echelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely</P>\n","<P>17    impossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like</P>\n","<P>18    that, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is</P>\n","<P>19    impossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such</P>\n","<P>20    thing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did</P>\n","<P>21    commit crimes.  And it wasn't only individuals who committed crimes.</P>\n","<P>22    There was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.</P>\n","<P>23    And I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my</P>\n","<P>24    information, but I can't be well-versed in everything, but I can in</P>\n","<P>25    basics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    wasn't the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit</P>\n","<P> 2    crimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn't the policy of the</P>\n","<P> 3    leadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.</P>\n","<P> 4            Now, --</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn't the policy of this accused in</P>\n","<P> 6    concert with other --</P>\n","<P> 7            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of</P>\n","<P> 8    Mr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,</P>\n","<P> 9    continuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such</P>\n","<P>10    crimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the</P>\n","<P>11    most serious form of war crimes.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There's an enormous</P>\n","<P>15    list of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,</P>\n","<P>16    and the subject here is deportation.</P>\n","<P>17            Now, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let's clarify that.  Albeit in</P>\n","<P>18    Serbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,</P>\n","<P>19    Muslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,</P>\n","<P>20    70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle</P>\n","<P>21    of non-discrimination like anybody else.</P>\n","<P>22            Now, I can't clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is</P>\n","<P>23    being accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it</P>\n","<P>24    stated here -- it says:  \"Milosevic, acting alone or together with other</P>\n","<P>25    members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or</P>\n","<P> 2    execution of the unlawful forcible transfer...\"</P>\n","<P> 3            Now, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic</P>\n","<P> 4    of Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or</P>\n","<P> 5    unlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful</P>\n","<P> 6    movement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one</P>\n","<P> 7    individual?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with</P>\n","<P> 9    anything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these</P>\n","<P>10    phenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what</P>\n","<P>11    did happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group</P>\n","<P>12    to leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that</P>\n","<P>13    desire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were</P>\n","<P>14    instances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,</P>\n","<P>15    that people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,</P>\n","<P>16    something afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind</P>\n","<P>17    what had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to</P>\n","<P>18    move out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or</P>\n","<P>19    perhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they</P>\n","<P>20    were the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and</P>\n","<P>21    in some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established</P>\n","<P>22    in some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete</P>\n","<P>23    example, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from</P>\n","<P>24    Prijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a</P>\n","<P>25    convoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I'm stopping you because you have</P>\n","<P> 2    answered the question.  You are becoming a little too expansive.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think that this would be very</P>\n","<P> 4    important.</P>\n","<P> 5            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what example do you know of personally?</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   I'm talking about one example when Muslims were transported</P>\n","<P> 8    because they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And</P>\n","<P> 9    then the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose</P>\n","<P>10    name is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is</P>\n","<P>11    called Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large</P>\n","<P>12    group of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the</P>\n","<P>13    authorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part</P>\n","<P>14    of Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army</P>\n","<P>15    of Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.</P>\n","<P>16            Then he tried to explain this in a completely different way:</P>\n","<P>17    Somebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he's</P>\n","<P>18    trying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.</P>\n","<P>19            Such people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,</P>\n","<P>20    entered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and</P>\n","<P>21    then they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed</P>\n","<P>22    although they are invariably false because --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm stopping you.  Mr. Seselj, no doubt you're a</P>\n","<P>24    man of many virtues.  Is omniscience one of them?  How do you happen to</P>\n","<P>25    know all these things?  I have to ask myself that question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson --</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Where is your knowledge coming from?</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, all my life I have</P>\n","<P> 4    been learning, learning, learning, and constantly learning.  Even now in</P>\n","<P> 5    prison I read eight to ten hours a day, although the conditions under</P>\n","<P> 6    which I live are very poor because they want to prevent me from preparing</P>\n","<P> 7    my defence case properly.  But I'm a constant learner, and I wish others</P>\n","<P> 8    were too.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  It would help my appreciation of your evidence if</P>\n","<P>10    only occasionally we were told of the basis for the information that you</P>\n","<P>11    have about specific matters.</P>\n","<P>12            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of</P>\n","<P>15    Serbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and</P>\n","<P>16    that as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon</P>\n","<P>17    what do you base this statement?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I</P>\n","<P>19    base my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent</P>\n","<P>20    statements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.</P>\n","<P>21            Secondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.</P>\n","<P>22    They never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never</P>\n","<P>23    discriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the</P>\n","<P>24    authorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in</P>\n","<P>25    Bosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","\n","\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    and treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.</P>\n","<P> 2            So there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic</P>\n","<P> 3    whatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution</P>\n","<P> 4    of Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in</P>\n","<P> 5    Serbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal</P>\n","<P> 6    of money.  Perhaps not all of them were happy with what they got, but this</P>\n","<P> 7    involved major expenditure on the part of the state.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  But did the authorities of Serbia allow</P>\n","<P> 9    discrimination over any Muslim Croat or the member of any other ethnic</P>\n","<P>10    group in Serbia during the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   No.  Even if there were any incidents on ethnic grounds, the</P>\n","<P>12    authorities acted in accordance with the law and brought such matters to</P>\n","<P>13    trial.  They simply did not allow things like that to happen.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Please look at paragraph 42 now.  Again it says here:  \"Slobodan</P>\n","<P>15    Milosevic,\" and so on and so forth, on or about the 1st of March, 1992,</P>\n","<P>16    until 391st of December, 1995, acting alone or in concert with members of</P>\n","<P>17    the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or</P>\n","<P>18    otherwise aided and abetted the planning preparation or execution of</P>\n","<P>19    wanton destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the</P>\n","<P>20    Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations and then\" --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, too fast.  Too fast.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   So I, Mr. Seselj, according to this paragraph 42, aided and</P>\n","<P>24    abetted the planning, preparation or execution, I executed this.  It</P>\n","<P>25    wasn't that I only aided and abetted others, but I committed wanton</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the Bosnian</P>\n","<P> 2    Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations, and again all these</P>\n","<P> 3    municipalities are listed here where I committed wanton looting of</P>\n","<P> 4    property belonging to Muslims and Croats.</P>\n","<P> 5            Please tell us not only what you know about this but also on the</P>\n","<P> 6    basis of what you know what you know.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in</P>\n","<P> 8    any way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of</P>\n","<P> 9    private and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three</P>\n","<P>10    sides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything</P>\n","<P>11    under control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.</P>\n","<P>12            What happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims</P>\n","<P>13    would loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have</P>\n","<P>14    their own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar</P>\n","<P>15    way in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no</P>\n","<P>16    official authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No</P>\n","<P>17    one personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,</P>\n","<P>18    et cetera.</P>\n","<P>19            There were paramilitary formations that had looting as their</P>\n","<P>20    primary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also</P>\n","<P>21    from Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People</P>\n","<P>22    travelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize</P>\n","<P>23    their car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were</P>\n","<P>24    such cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial</P>\n","<P>25    Chamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    looting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions</P>\n","<P> 2    that were rather chaotic.</P>\n","<P> 3            There was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.</P>\n","<P> 4    Not only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika</P>\n","<P> 5    Srpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in</P>\n","<P> 7    a military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto</P>\n","<P> 8    civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and</P>\n","<P> 9    wounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.</P>\n","<P>10            You were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please</P>\n","<P>11    explain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,</P>\n","<P>12    tell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of</P>\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.</P>\n","<P>14       A.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a</P>\n","<P>15    dissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict</P>\n","<P>16    in Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of</P>\n","<P>17    the duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case</P>\n","<P>18    elsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on</P>\n","<P>19    both sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less</P>\n","<P>20    casualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what</P>\n","<P>21    Judge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I</P>\n","<P>22    read.</P>\n","<P>23            I was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the</P>\n","<P>24    killing of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted</P>\n","<P>25    intentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Muslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present</P>\n","<P> 2    this in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,</P>\n","<P> 3    Vasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not</P>\n","<P> 4    take part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official</P>\n","<P> 5    factors from Serbia, that is.</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.  On the transcript it's a double</P>\n","<P> 7    negative.</P>\n","<P> 8            Yes, Mr. --</P>\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] There is a double negative in the</P>\n","<P>10    Serbian language and it does not change the meaning of the statement.  In</P>\n","<P>11    English it might mean something different.  I'm sorry I don't know English</P>\n","<P>12    and I cannot really adjust to this.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or</P>\n","<P>15    deny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took</P>\n","<P>16    part in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you</P>\n","<P>17    confirm that?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   All right.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The</P>\n","<P>21    Muslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the</P>\n","<P>22    liberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his</P>\n","<P>24    witness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,</P>\n","<P>25    including women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only</P>\n","<P> 2    logical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee</P>\n","<P> 3    from war.  They're fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.</P>\n","<P> 4            Very often in this war and in any other war civilians would get</P>\n","<P> 5    killed by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from</P>\n","<P> 6    the conflict.</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the</P>\n","<P> 8    Serbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it's supposed</P>\n","<P> 9    to seem?</P>\n","<P>10       A.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray</P>\n","<P>11    this, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their</P>\n","<P>12    victims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We</P>\n","<P>13    are faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is</P>\n","<P>14    based and anti-Serb grounds.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings</P>\n","<P>16    happened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all</P>\n","<P>17    of that can be found here in this indictment that I've been quoting to</P>\n","<P>18    you, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to</P>\n","<P>20    give.  Ask another question.</P>\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a</P>\n","<P>22    question to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that</P>\n","<P>23    he can give an answer.  He's a politician, an intellectual, a university</P>\n","<P>24    professor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,</P>\n","<P>25    and he is in a position to give an answer to this question.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And I've already ruled that he is not to answer</P>\n","<P> 2    it.  So proceed.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the</P>\n","<P> 6    JNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know</P>\n","<P> 7    about that?  This is on transcript page 20408.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The</P>\n","<P> 9    two sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the</P>\n","<P>10    bridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric</P>\n","<P>11    power plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to</P>\n","<P>12    destroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old</P>\n","<P>13    hydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the</P>\n","<P>14    paramilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The</P>\n","<P>15    conflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can't say exactly, I</P>\n","<P>16    wasn't there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And</P>\n","<P>17    then also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units</P>\n","<P>19    committed crimes in Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there</P>\n","<P>21    that can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but</P>\n","<P>22    who it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are</P>\n","<P>23    ascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to</P>\n","<P>24    Karadzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.</P>\n","<P>25            In Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    people for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing</P>\n","<P> 5    them, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They</P>\n","<P> 6    are mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided</P>\n","<P> 7    by Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,</P>\n","<P> 8    Drinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you</P>\n","<P> 9    heard anything about this and what do you know about it?</P>\n","<P>10       A.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my</P>\n","<P>11    knowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but</P>\n","<P>12    once the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very</P>\n","<P>13    simply, who the victims were and who the executors were.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the</P>\n","<P>15    cultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many</P>\n","<P>16    persons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force</P>\n","<P>17    there is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I'll just go</P>\n","<P>18    on.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were</P>\n","<P>20    committed.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn't the JNA that</P>\n","<P>21    took part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take</P>\n","<P>22    part in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully</P>\n","<P>23    investigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims</P>\n","<P>24    are still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether</P>\n","<P>25    there was enough will to investigate this matter, and I've already</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    referred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect</P>\n","<P> 2    a great deal from that.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I don't know anything about it.  I wasn't there.</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj and Mr. Milosevic, you are not</P>\n","<P> 6    observing the pause between question and answer, and you are thereby</P>\n","<P> 7    creating difficulties for the interpreter.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, this is the first time</P>\n","<P> 9    you have warned us about this today.  As you see, Mr. Seselj and I are</P>\n","<P>10    bearing this in mind.</P>\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We're practising.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment</P>\n","<P>14    in this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your</P>\n","<P>15    units.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan's men.  Do</P>\n","<P>16    you have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your</P>\n","<P>17    units were there?  You've already explained you didn't have any units of</P>\n","<P>18    yours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers</P>\n","<P>19    were there?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I'm not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik</P>\n","<P>21    area.  I know that Arkan's Tigers were active there but to what extent and</P>\n","<P>22    in what locations I couldn't say because I wasn't there.</P>\n","<P>23            All the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I</P>\n","<P>24    do not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and</P>\n","<P>25    misfortunes he talked about, but evidently he's very confused when</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    identifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He's mixing up Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 2    men, the White Eagles, Arkan's men, and this shows that he's very confused</P>\n","<P> 3    and unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers</P>\n","<P> 4    of the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to</P>\n","<P> 5    everything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very</P>\n","<P> 6    often it's beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn't be easy to</P>\n","<P> 7    establish who actually perpetrated this.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a</P>\n","<P> 9    certain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the</P>\n","<P>10    transcript.  Do you know anything about this?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>12    committed any crimes in that place.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>14    Radical Party?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>16    sent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,</P>\n","<P>17    and as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me</P>\n","<P>18    had any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I'm sure of it.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Would other volunteers have reported this?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and</P>\n","<P>21    they would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,</P>\n","<P>22    because this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about</P>\n","<P>24    the conducts of the volunteers?</P>\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn't say the reports were</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    regular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out</P>\n","<P> 2    how the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All</P>\n","<P> 3    the problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of</P>\n","<P> 4    indiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers</P>\n","<P> 5    to be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline</P>\n","<P> 6    of the other men.</P>\n","<P> 7            I was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the</P>\n","<P> 8    conclusion that none occurred.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral</P>\n","<P>11    conversations.</P>\n","<P>12            I'm convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written</P>\n","<P>13    reports would have been sent to me.  I'm sure that the competent command</P>\n","<P>14    would have told me had something like this happened.</P>\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>16            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Mr. Seselj, if you can't recall it doesn't matter, but is it true</P>\n","<P>18    that in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,</P>\n","<P>19    1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of</P>\n","<P>20    Seselj's men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj's men, then</P>\n","<P>22    should be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell</P>\n","<P>23    you whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group</P>\n","<P>24    of Seselj's men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he's</P>\n","<P>25    the leader if they don't know his name?  What does the term \"leader\" mean?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Was he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times</P>\n","<P> 2    that volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in</P>\n","<P> 3    units larger than a company.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I</P>\n","<P> 6    have a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I</P>\n","<P> 7    wanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the</P>\n","<P> 8    indictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no</P>\n","<P> 9    such instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>10    Party.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such</P>\n","<P>14    instances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various</P>\n","<P>15    allegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of</P>\n","<P>16    time.</P>\n","<P>17            Please tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about</P>\n","<P>18    the events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men</P>\n","<P>19    participated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   First of all --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is that reference?</P>\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I quoted about half an hour ago, but</P>\n","<P>23    it wasn't sufficiently clear.  I will try to find it again.  I'm simply</P>\n","<P>24    trying to establish whether the witness knows anything about</P>\n","<P>25    Bosanski Samac.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","\n","\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have some knowledge but --</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  The answer -- the question I have is --  what do</P>\n","<P> 3    you mean by \"because it says,\" it says, \"that your men participated in</P>\n","<P> 4    taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\"  What is \"it\"?</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj something about</P>\n","<P> 6    Samac before, but right now I can't find it.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  I take it it's not another reference to the</P>\n","<P> 8    indictment against Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P> 9            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I don't think it is.</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have Bosanski Samac mentioned in</P>\n","<P>11    several places on your indictment, if I can be of assistance, and I can</P>\n","<P>12    tell you what I know about the events in Bosanski Samac.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Well, that's the only reason I asked you whether you knew</P>\n","<P>15    anything.</P>\n","<P>16       A.   In paragraph 42 Bosanski Samac is ascribed to you.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Well, all the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are</P>\n","<P>18    ascribed to me.  There aren't any which are not ascribed to me.  But what</P>\n","<P>19    do you know about the events there?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I don't understand this question.  You</P>\n","<P>21    can't just ask a question, take a municipality and say, \"What do you know</P>\n","<P>22    about events there?\"  There's got to be some point to the question.</P>\n","<P>23            Now, what is this dealing with?</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Very well.  I won't ask you anything about that, then, because I</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    can't find the reference now.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, Mr. Milosevic.  If you find the</P>\n","<P> 3    reference, you can come back to it, but bear in mind that you undertook to</P>\n","<P> 4    complete the evidence in chief today.</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I'm doing my best, Mr. Robinson, but</P>\n","<P> 6    there are many, many witnesses who mentioned Mr. Seselj, and I want to see</P>\n","<P> 7    whether there's any truth in anything they said.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, you may -- Mr. Milosevic, you may have</P>\n","<P> 9    other witnesses who may be in a better position to contradict the</P>\n","<P>10    assertions in the Prosecution case than Mr. Seselj himself.  Don't assume</P>\n","<P>11    that because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he's the</P>\n","<P>12    best person to contradict it.</P>\n","<P>13            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.</P>\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   On page 23520 of the transcript.  I'll skip over the witness's</P>\n","<P>16    name because I can't recall at present whether or not he was protected,</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Robinson.  I don't think he was, because I don't have any note to that</P>\n","<P>18    effect, but he says:  \"In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the</P>\n","<P>19    White Wolves, and the JNA participated.\"</P>\n","<P>20            Do you know anything about this?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,</P>\n","<P>22    there was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from</P>\n","<P>23    Eastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the</P>\n","<P>24    indictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.</P>\n","<P>25    His name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    helicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was</P>\n","<P> 2    accompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 3    Party, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for</P>\n","<P> 4    sure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also</P>\n","<P> 5    Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as</P>\n","<P> 6    the Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was</P>\n","<P> 7    charged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in</P>\n","<P> 8    Banja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 9    Party.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and</P>\n","<P>10    the party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don't know that Kragujevac</P>\n","<P>12    is not in Bosnia.</P>\n","<P>13       A.   That's correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I'm getting ready</P>\n","<P>14    to obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was</P>\n","<P>15    expelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan</P>\n","<P>16    Savic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the</P>\n","<P>17    Serb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave</P>\n","<P>18    my legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial</P>\n","<P>19    and all the accompanying materials.</P>\n","<P>20            As for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to</P>\n","<P>21    me certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man</P>\n","<P>22    Radovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his</P>\n","<P>23    participation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.</P>\n","<P>24            Those are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members</P>\n","<P>25    of the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    had previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even</P>\n","<P> 2    called him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was</P>\n","<P> 3    Srecko Radovanovic.</P>\n","<P> 4            There was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was</P>\n","<P> 5    certainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was</P>\n","<P> 6    certainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been</P>\n","<P> 7    he would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that</P>\n","<P> 8    unit was called the Grey Wolves.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I've understood</P>\n","<P>10    from that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions</P>\n","<P>11    in Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you've said?</P>\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,</P>\n","<P>13    yes.</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called</P>\n","<P>15    the Grey Wolves active there?</P>\n","<P>16            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it's very problematic to say</P>\n","<P>17    paramilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means</P>\n","<P>18    outside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial</P>\n","<P>19    Defence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I'm not</P>\n","<P>20    sure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,</P>\n","<P>21    I think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good</P>\n","<P>22    fighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what</P>\n","<P>23    happened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called</P>\n","<P>24    Crkvina or something like that.  I can't recall it all off the top of my</P>\n","<P>25    head, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Banja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven't dealt with.  Did</P>\n","<P> 3    they participate?</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What</P>\n","<P> 5    Red Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's a perfectly legitimate answer for you to</P>\n","<P> 7    give, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the</P>\n","<P> 8    Red Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the</P>\n","<P> 9    quotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,</P>\n","<P>10    which on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they've got</P>\n","<P>11    nothing to do with the question.  So all I'm doing now is trying to find</P>\n","<P>12    out what the real answer to that question is.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.</P>\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the</P>\n","<P>15    Red Berets.</P>\n","<P>16                          --- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.</P>\n","<P>17                          --- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the</P>\n","<P>19    technical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary</P>\n","<P>20    resulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected</P>\n","<P>21    witness.</P>\n","<P>22            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>23            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Wolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also</P>\n","<P> 2    mentioned.  Now, the witness, I don't know whether he was protected or</P>\n","<P> 3    not, I don't want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript says that he saw 20 locals, and it's about Samac, wearing</P>\n","<P> 5    uniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed</P>\n","<P> 6    they were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned</P>\n","<P> 7    to Samac.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, I don't have any information to that effect, and that is</P>\n","<P> 9    quite impossible.  I'd like to point out once again that in different</P>\n","<P>10    places they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had</P>\n","<P>11    found some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have</P>\n","<P>12    been various units, especially as we're talking about locals in this</P>\n","<P>13    particular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What</P>\n","<P>14    does it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some</P>\n","<P>15    warehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they</P>\n","<P>16    were some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the</P>\n","<P>17    Red Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of</P>\n","<P>18    the State Security in 1996.</P>\n","<P>19            So quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term</P>\n","<P>20    applies to different concepts.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I</P>\n","<P>22    think that is in the indictment against you but you'll put me right if I'm</P>\n","<P>23    wrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,</P>\n","<P>24    that is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,</P>\n","<P>25    wherein amongst others you said:  \"Dear brother Chetniks, especially you</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    across the Drina, you're the bravest, and we're going to clear up Bosnia</P>\n","<P> 2    from the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong.\"  Is</P>\n","<P> 3    it true that you said that?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and</P>\n","<P> 5    partially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,</P>\n","<P> 6    because -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don't always know</P>\n","<P> 7    the Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an</P>\n","<P> 8    artificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the</P>\n","<P> 9    Croats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian</P>\n","<P>10    variation \"pogan\" means \"pagan,\" where as in the Serb language \"pogan\"</P>\n","<P>11    means \"waste\" or \"faeces.\"  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and</P>\n","<P>12    pan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called</P>\n","<P>13    them \"pogani,\" which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the</P>\n","<P>14    Muslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I'm not a stupid</P>\n","<P>15    man.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have</P>\n","<P>16    nothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more</P>\n","<P>17    than I do to all the Christians afterwards, let's make that point clear,</P>\n","<P>18    but I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --</P>\n","<P>19    greatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims</P>\n","<P>20    to be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.</P>\n","<P>21            So here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion</P>\n","<P>22    is being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,</P>\n","<P>23    and I've been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,</P>\n","<P>24    Islamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they</P>\n","<P>25    first appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.  Well, if you</P>\n","<P> 4    haven't got if it in my books then the Prosecution probably has a copy</P>\n","<P> 5    because most of my speeches were published in my books, in my works so, if</P>\n","<P> 6    a speech does not happen to be there, if --</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  Was this one published in your books?  I apologise.</P>\n","<P> 8    I haven't read them all.</P>\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson [sic], two years ago I</P>\n","<P>10    handed over to The Hague Tribunal 80 of my printed works.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  Is this speech in any of them?</P>\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Most probably, but it would be up to</P>\n","<P>13    the Prosecution to find it, not me.  I can't look through that whole</P>\n","<P>14    matter myself, because I didn't make the statement only in one place.  I</P>\n","<P>15    made the statement in several places, on several occasions.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  Well, normally the party presenting the evidence is</P>\n","<P>17    responsible for getting it to court in some -- as official as is possible,</P>\n","<P>18    but you're not aware of a copy of it being available for us as part of the</P>\n","<P>19    papers in connection with your evidence.</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Bonomy, the side that has</P>\n","<P>21    referred to my alleged speech is the Prosecution's side.  So I'm just</P>\n","<P>22    telling you where they made a mistake.  So they can find the original of</P>\n","<P>23    the speech and present it here.  I can't do the work of the Prosecution.</P>\n","<P>24    I can't be expected to do that.  I am testifying to the facts and</P>\n","<P>25    circumstances about which I have knowledge.  I'm not here to help the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Prosecution out in its work.  And for my part, I have contributed</P>\n","<P> 2    sufficiently by handing over all my books.  They have far greater</P>\n","<P> 3    resources than I do.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Nice, can you help?  Where do I locate the</P>\n","<P> 5    evidence, readily locate the evidence in relation to this?</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. NICE:  I'm not sure you can locate it readily at the moment</P>\n","<P> 7    from our own database.  It may be possible.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  It appears Mr. Seselj is suggesting that there is</P>\n","<P> 9    evidence of this speech led by the Prosecution in this case.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  It may be in this case or it may be in the pre-trial</P>\n","<P>11    brief of his own case.  I'll deal with it as soon as I can.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  All right.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. NICE:  We can't of course be guided in the way we are going to</P>\n","<P>14    present our questions through his observations.  We'll make our own</P>\n","<P>15    decisions.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  No, no, no.  That's nothing to the point.  I'm just</P>\n","<P>17    trying to clarify where I can read this speech, but if no one's going to</P>\n","<P>18    help me, that's okay.</P>\n","<P>19            MR. NICE:  We certainly will help you when we can.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Witness B1643 who testified pursuant to 92 bis, I assume you know</P>\n","<P>23    the written part, mentioned torture and capture of civilians in the SUP</P>\n","<P>24    building of the Territorial Defence in the primary school and secondary</P>\n","<P>25    school in Crkvina, the warehouse there.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, I already mentioned something about this.  I said that the</P>\n","<P> 2    Crkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey</P>\n","<P> 3    Wolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was</P>\n","<P> 4    arrested, but I don't have any details about how the trial proceeded and</P>\n","<P> 5    the upshot.  I asked my legal advisors to find the complete dossier of</P>\n","<P> 6    that trial, but I do know for certain that he was arrested and taken to</P>\n","<P> 7    trial in Banja Luka, prosecuted in Banja Luka.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   The indictment against you, in the indictment you are accused of</P>\n","<P> 9    an act on the 7th of May, 1992, which allegedly happened there which says</P>\n","<P>10    that two leaders of your group under your command killed 18 males at the</P>\n","<P>11    agricultural farm in Crkvina.  Is that the event you are referring to?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn't there</P>\n","<P>13    nor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical</P>\n","<P>14    Party.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   That's all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your</P>\n","<P>16    answer suffices.</P>\n","<P>17            You are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when</P>\n","<P>18    allegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated</P>\n","<P>19    killed 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating</P>\n","<P>21    on the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?</P>\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was</P>\n","<P>23    quoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>\n","<P>24    So it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this</P>\n","<P>25    question of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    concept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he</P>\n","<P> 2    stands accused, because he's testifying here.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily</P>\n","<P> 4    relevant for that purpose.</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I'm not going to</P>\n","<P> 6    insist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.</P>\n","<P> 7            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993</P>\n","<P> 9    some members of your alleged --</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have</P>\n","<P>11    continued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not</P>\n","<P>12    see at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial</P>\n","<P>13    here.  I know that he's alleged to be a member of the joint criminal</P>\n","<P>14    enterprise.  I'm well aware of that.  But that doesn't let in any and all</P>\n","<P>15    kind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.</P>\n","<P>16            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see</P>\n","<P>17    here that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,</P>\n","<P>18    then that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren't true</P>\n","<P>19    either, and he has refuted a number of witnesses' statements here that I</P>\n","<P>20    quoted.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know</P>\n","<P>22    you know that.</P>\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, witness William Thomas Francis Roy on page 28882 of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","\n","\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the transcript stated here that the Muslim snipers killed three pregnant</P>\n","<P> 2    women and only then did the Serb snipers respond by opening fire.  Do you</P>\n","<P> 3    know anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked</P>\n","<P> 4    to killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire</P>\n","<P> 6    in Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front</P>\n","<P> 7    line stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part</P>\n","<P> 8    under Muslim control and another part under Serb control.</P>\n","<P> 9            Now, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind</P>\n","<P>10    the following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from</P>\n","<P>11    rifles which wasn't a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because</P>\n","<P>12    sniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with</P>\n","<P>13    optic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the</P>\n","<P>14    Serb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to</P>\n","<P>15    come by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black</P>\n","<P>16    market.  I don't exclude the possibility of individual cases there being</P>\n","<P>17    the need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was</P>\n","<P>18    opened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain</P>\n","<P>19    control of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two</P>\n","<P>20    sides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn't</P>\n","<P>21    change for many years, and one or the other side would take control of</P>\n","<P>22    certain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.</P>\n","<P>23            On the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional</P>\n","<P>24    killing of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims</P>\n","<P>25    killed about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    in Kazani and so on.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the</P>\n","<P> 3    Sarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present</P>\n","<P> 4    on both sides.  Is that true?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in</P>\n","<P> 6    Sarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The</P>\n","<P> 7    real snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far</P>\n","<P> 8    more than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more</P>\n","<P> 9    sophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more</P>\n","<P>10    favourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I've forgotten the evidence which I</P>\n","<P>12    think there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How</P>\n","<P>13    much personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the</P>\n","<P>14    conflict there.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to</P>\n","<P>16    the Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that</P>\n","<P>17    is.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.</P>\n","<P>18    At Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and</P>\n","<P>19    I met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh</P>\n","<P>20    shipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my</P>\n","<P>21    colleagues from university and also people whom I'd been to school with,</P>\n","<P>22    Muslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire</P>\n","<P>24    going on?</P>\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    stay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some</P>\n","<P> 2    dangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you</P>\n","<P> 3    had to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but</P>\n","<P> 4    there were no more serious conflicts at that time.</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,</P>\n","<P> 8    referred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on</P>\n","<P> 9    page 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs</P>\n","<P>10    fired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in</P>\n","<P>11    Sarajevo?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open</P>\n","<P>13    fire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be</P>\n","<P>14    ascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused</P>\n","<P>15    protected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction</P>\n","<P>16    from the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo</P>\n","<P>17    they would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at</P>\n","<P>18    Serb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off</P>\n","<P>19    in the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,</P>\n","<P>20    then they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at</P>\n","<P>21    hospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,</P>\n","<P>22    who were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the</P>\n","<P>23    hospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw</P>\n","<P>24    quickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived</P>\n","<P>25    they didn't come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    fire in retaliation.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited</P>\n","<P> 3    Bijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --</P>\n","<P> 4    page 8258 of Alija Gusalic's -- 18258, and I link this up with your</P>\n","<P> 5    indictment and Alija Gusalic's testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina</P>\n","<P> 6    and members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to</P>\n","<P> 7    takeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite</P>\n","<P> 9    correct.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just</P>\n","<P>10    nonsense.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there</P>\n","<P>12    were Arkan's men and Seselj's men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything</P>\n","<P>13    about that?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb</P>\n","<P>15    Radical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I'm absolutely certain</P>\n","<P>16    of that.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   The same witness says on page 18260, \"Seselj's men had beards and</P>\n","<P>18    cockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to</P>\n","<P>19    distribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party.\"</P>\n","<P>20       A.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>21    Radical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly</P>\n","<P>22    clean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not</P>\n","<P>23    bring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot</P>\n","<P>24    be synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for</P>\n","<P>25    ideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    not a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier</P>\n","<P> 2    having a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not</P>\n","<P> 3    distribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role</P>\n","<P> 4    in these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.</P>\n","<P> 5            Members of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but</P>\n","<P> 6    exclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now</P>\n","<P> 8    I'm asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were</P>\n","<P> 9    not Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were</P>\n","<P>10    held at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you</P>\n","<P>11    know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   I don't know about those particular localities, but I've already</P>\n","<P>13    talked about Mauzer's and Arkan's conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for</P>\n","<P>14    that reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often</P>\n","<P>15    attacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   I'm sorry that I didn't draw your attention to this on time,</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you</P>\n","<P>18    are being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in</P>\n","<P>19    Batkovic.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I've already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>21    Radical Party there.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.</P>\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic</P>\n","<P>24    testified here, and he made those assertions here, and I'm linking that up</P>\n","<P>25    with --</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness</P>\n","<P> 2    made the allegations here.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp</P>\n","<P> 4    near Bijeljina.  And I've linked that up to what the indictment against</P>\n","<P> 5    Mr. Seselj says.</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that's not relevant.  Move on.</P>\n","<P> 7            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused</P>\n","<P> 9    Mr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a</P>\n","<P>10    hundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?</P>\n","<P>11            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it's not relevant to</P>\n","<P>13    this case.</P>\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the</P>\n","<P>15    basis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks</P>\n","<P>16    about Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj's indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane</P>\n","<P>18    treatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's indictment?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the</P>\n","<P>23    International Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything</P>\n","<P>24    about this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   I don't know anything about the visit of the International Red</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Cross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.</P>\n","<P> 2    Also, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of</P>\n","<P> 3    prisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not</P>\n","<P> 4    take part in any such thing.</P>\n","<P> 5            As for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and</P>\n","<P> 6    if there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would</P>\n","<P> 7    have to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right.  I'm not going to ask you about this anymore.  You</P>\n","<P> 9    mentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is</P>\n","<P>10    that right?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the</P>\n","<P>13    activity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the</P>\n","<P>14    situation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,</P>\n","<P>15    do you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no</P>\n","<P>17    paramilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in</P>\n","<P>18    Mostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,</P>\n","<P>19    from the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>20    Party were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them</P>\n","<P>21    as highly disciplined on Belgrade television.</P>\n","<P>22            If there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have</P>\n","<P>23    been members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention</P>\n","<P>24    platoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not</P>\n","<P>25    preclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    was not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp</P>\n","<P> 3    there were Seselj's Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   That is absolutely impossible.  I've never heard of the White</P>\n","<P> 6    Eagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven't heard of this Buna</P>\n","<P> 7    camp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 8    Party, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared</P>\n","<P> 9    in Buna.  I don't know anything about this, but there should be proper</P>\n","<P>10    records to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White</P>\n","<P>11    Eagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any</P>\n","<P>12    Red Berets.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in</P>\n","<P>14    Nevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I</P>\n","<P>16    was in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and</P>\n","<P>17    in the Neretva valley.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in</P>\n","<P>20    Nevesinje.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   That will do.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable</P>\n","<P>23    number of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no</P>\n","<P>24    conflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large</P>\n","<P>25    number of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    were put up at various facilities there.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Do you know anything about a lake, Boracko Jezero, and a rest</P>\n","<P> 3    house there where about 19 persons were killed, according to the</P>\n","<P> 4    allegations made?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers</P>\n","<P> 6    of the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That's close to</P>\n","<P> 7    Konjic.  I've already said that there were members of the Serb guard</P>\n","<P> 8    there.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was</P>\n","<P> 9    there, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was</P>\n","<P>10    operating.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan's Serb</P>\n","<P>12    volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared</P>\n","<P>16    elsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities</P>\n","<P>17    had a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because</P>\n","<P>18    they stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then</P>\n","<P>19    they appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a</P>\n","<P>20    lot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic's.  As far as I</P>\n","<P>21    know, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>\n","<P>23       A.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav</P>\n","<P>24    Lajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   The Serb guard.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Of Vuk Draskovic?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from</P>\n","<P> 4    Novi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made</P>\n","<P> 6    to the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.  I've forgotten</P>\n","<P> 7    his first name.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Jovan.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Jovan Dulovic who testified here.  Mr. Robinson instructed me to</P>\n","<P>10    find the original documents that can be linked up to your submissions</P>\n","<P>11    since they refused to admit your submissions.</P>\n","<P>12            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I am sorry, Mr. Robinson.  If you're</P>\n","<P>13    telling me to have copies made I will do that, but I've just received</P>\n","<P>14    these copies.  This is a series of photocopies of articles written by</P>\n","<P>15    Jovan Dulovic and published in Ekspres Politika from the 16th of November,</P>\n","<P>16    the 26th of November, all of that in 1991.  Then the 18th of November, the</P>\n","<P>17    2nd of November.  So from November 1991.</P>\n","<P>18            In these articles, he speaks very favourably of the JNA and</P>\n","<P>19    commends their behaviour in the fighting around Vukovar.  For example, he</P>\n","<P>20    says that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats, saw the light of</P>\n","<P>21    the day after having stayed in cellars for many --</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, what is the question?</P>\n","<P>23            MR. NICE:  And, Your Honour, if I may interrupt, if there's going</P>\n","<P>24    to be a reference to and quotation from a newspaper article, it has to be</P>\n","<P>25    on the overhead projector.  It then has to be available to us to read it</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    in full should we wish to.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's -- that's the practice, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.</P>\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, since I have only one copy of these articles and I've</P>\n","<P> 6    just received that, could the usher please place them on the ELMO, and</P>\n","<P> 7    then you can have a look at least at some of the parts that have been</P>\n","<P> 8    marked.  Reference is made to Major Sljivancanin here, too, in a very</P>\n","<P> 9    favourable light.  Gratitude for assistance to civilians, Croats, at that,</P>\n","<P>10    and so on and so forth.  Please look at this series of articles.</P>\n","<P>11            In order to answer my question, are these at least partly articles</P>\n","<P>12    that you relied on when you wrote those submissions to the other side</P>\n","<P>13    about the untruthful testimony of Jovan Dulovic or, rather, the difference</P>\n","<P>14    in -- between his reporting then and his testimony here about Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>15            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, that was a leading but nevertheless it's</P>\n","<P>16    interesting to see what the articles actually say.  And if it becomes</P>\n","<P>17    relevant to consider their admissibility as evidence, I know the Chamber</P>\n","<P>18    will have in mind its open recent ruling in respect of the documents of</P>\n","<P>19    Jasovic and the potential evidential value or not as evidence of these</P>\n","<P>20    documents, but I'm most interested frankly in seeing what they actually</P>\n","<P>21    say.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let's get it on the overhead projector.</P>\n","<P>23            There appears to be a technical problem.  We're not seeing</P>\n","<P>24    anything.</P>\n","<P>25            Mr. Milosevic, the technician is being called.  He's coming in.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1   </P>\n","<P> 2   </P>\n","<P> 3   </P>\n","<P> 4   </P>\n","<P> 5   </P>\n","<P> 6   </P>\n","<P> 7   </P>\n","<P> 8   </P>\n","<P> 9   </P>\n","<P>10   </P>\n","<P>11   </P>\n","\n","\n","<P>14   </P>\n","<P>15   </P>\n","<P>16   </P>\n","<P>17   </P>\n","<P>18   </P>\n","<P>19   </P>\n","<P>20   </P>\n","<P>21   </P>\n","<P>22   </P>\n","<P>23   </P>\n","<P>24   </P>\n","<P>25   </P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    So move on to another question.  We'll come back to this.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am sorry, but my</P>\n","<P> 3    next question also has to do with something that Mr. Seselj already</P>\n","<P> 4    testified about and the document that I obtained in the meantime and that</P>\n","<P> 5    would also have to be placed on the ELMO.  That is --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,</P>\n","<P> 7    because the overhead projector is not working.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further</P>\n","<P> 9    questions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except</P>\n","<P>10    for this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a</P>\n","<P>11    decision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were</P>\n","<P>12    presented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal</P>\n","<P>13    government said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was</P>\n","<P>14    known who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.</P>\n","<P>15    The 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.  So it is about</P>\n","<P>16    40 days after the coup d'etat of the 5th of October, 2000.  It was then</P>\n","<P>17    that they were all released, set free.</P>\n","<P>18            So wanted to show you this document, and I wanted to hand out</P>\n","<P>19    copies to you.  I've just received this.  They are all in the Serbian</P>\n","<P>20    language but they can be placed on the ELMO to show what the government</P>\n","<P>21    spokesman had said was completely disregarded, and these persons mentioned</P>\n","<P>22    in the criminal report against Erdemovic were set free.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The ELMO is working now, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please take a look at this.  This is a series of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    articles from Ekspres Politika.  Can you see the date of the newspaper?</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of</P>\n","<P> 3    November.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   1991; right?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   1991.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Unless this is a leading question.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   It's illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one</P>\n","<P> 8    of the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when</P>\n","<P> 9    preparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.</P>\n","<P>10    That is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of</P>\n","<P>11    Evidence and Procedure.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the</P>\n","<P>13    subheading?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both</P>\n","<P>15    Serbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars</P>\n","<P>16    for a long time.  \"Light finally,\" is the heading.  And then in the</P>\n","<P>17    subheading:  \"Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas.\"  And then there's</P>\n","<P>18    another bit saying, \"In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,\"</P>\n","<P>19    and then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, \"I cannot believe</P>\n","<P>20    that we are alive,\" and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated</P>\n","<P>21    the town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.</P>\n","<P>22            THE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of</P>\n","<P>23    the question was not heard by the interpreters.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.  The interpreters have</P>\n","<P>25    indicated that you're overlapping and so she did not hear the beginning of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the last question.  Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P> 2            And please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.</P>\n","<P> 5    Perhaps it's easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text</P>\n","<P> 6    is.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as</P>\n","<P> 8    follows:  \"A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total</P>\n","<P> 9    of 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity.\"</P>\n","<P>10    That's what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and</P>\n","<P>11    Croats equally.  Civilians, that is.</P>\n","<P>12            I can't read the first paragraph because it's quite illegible, but</P>\n","<P>13    it seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,</P>\n","<P>14    that several ambulances were waiting to help.  \"It would not be a good</P>\n","<P>15    thing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now.\"</P>\n","<P>16            So Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of</P>\n","<P>17    Vukovar before the fighting had stopped.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Can you see the subtitle which says \"The cruel major\"?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this</P>\n","<P>21    refers to and what it says about this cruel major.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians</P>\n","<P>23    very nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that</P>\n","<P>24    surprised this Croat woman, and he says:  \"No knows what she as a Croat</P>\n","<P>25    heard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers.\"  So he's describing the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    behaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what</P>\n","<P> 2    Croatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very</P>\n","<P> 3    bad way.</P>\n","<P> 4            And then Major Sljivancanin says:  \"Whenever you need anything,</P>\n","<P> 5    look for me and I'll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to</P>\n","<P> 6    go, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full</P>\n","<P> 7    of gratitude.\"  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  \"He had</P>\n","<P> 8    followed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude.\"</P>\n","<P> 9            All this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now</P>\n","<P>10    Colonel Veselin Sljivancanin.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic</P>\n","<P>12    describes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, \"Take this</P>\n","<P>13    child to hospital immediately.\"</P>\n","<P>14       A.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, \"Take this child to the</P>\n","<P>15    hospital in Negoslavci right away,\" Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing</P>\n","<P>16    the ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  \"Let her be given</P>\n","<P>17    assistance and medicine.\"</P>\n","<P>18            A little later Vlatka's mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for</P>\n","<P>19    her daughter in the crowd.  \"Where is my child?  What have they done to</P>\n","<P>20    her?  Where have they taken her,\" Verica was crying out.</P>\n","<P>21            \"Don't be afraid.  She is in hospital,\" Sljivancanin said.  The</P>\n","<P>22    frightened woman didn't believe it.\"  This is followed by Dulovic's</P>\n","<P>23    comment:  \"Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA</P>\n","<P>24    soldiers.\"</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   And what does it say then?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   \"Get into my car.  I'll take you to the hospital so you can see</P>\n","<P> 2    your child and reassure yourself that everything is all right.  They both</P>\n","<P> 3    entered the vehicle.  In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and</P>\n","<P> 4    dressed Vlatka's wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the</P>\n","<P> 5    daughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them.\"</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   So this is Dulovic's report from the Vukovar war theatre.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on</P>\n","<P> 9    the following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points</P>\n","<P>10    are.  This large title, this heading, that is.</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.  Now it's been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a</P>\n","<P>12    statement, \"I believed in the army.\"  And what's in the subtitle.  \"A</P>\n","<P>13    little less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in</P>\n","<P>14    Vukovar.\"  And then there's a quotation.</P>\n","<P>15       A.   \"We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the</P>\n","<P>16    guards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the</P>\n","<P>17    hospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims.\"</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   And look what it says in the article.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the</P>\n","<P>20    following:  \"In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and</P>\n","<P>21    barricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house</P>\n","<P>22    number 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,</P>\n","<P>23    Milos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.  A few days</P>\n","<P>24    later, the members of the guards burst into the cellar.  These were</P>\n","<P>25    members of the Croatian National Guard Corps.  Get out or we'll throw a</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    bomb in.  The Chetniks are coming.  They're cutting everyone's throats.</P>\n","<P> 2    We're taking you to a shelter.\"</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   It's quite illegible.  Could you put some light on it?</P>\n","<P> 4            Look at the passages marked in yellow.  You don't have to read it</P>\n","<P> 5    all out, just a few passages.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.    \"Several of us -- or, rather, above us on the cemetery the guards</P>\n","<P> 7    members were stationed.  Milka Vidovic said, 'When they visited us in the</P>\n","<P> 8    cellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone's throats.  We</P>\n","<P> 9    Serbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the</P>\n","<P>10    only thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.  I</P>\n","<P>11    believed in our army and I believed they would arrive.'\"</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  What's the question in relation to this,</P>\n","<P>13    Mr. Milosevic?</P>\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what is the signature marked in yellow here?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   Jovan Dulovic.  The same Jovan Dulovic who four or five years</P>\n","<P>17    later changed his version by -- he turned around by 180 degrees because he</P>\n","<P>18    has become a mercenary of the Western intelligence services, and he writes</P>\n","<P>19    for the magazine Vreme which is the Belgrade branch of Western</P>\n","<P>20    intelligence agencies.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   Mr. Seselj, when you glanced through this article and you dealt</P>\n","<P>22    with it in your submission, is there a single word here which does not</P>\n","<P>23    speak favourably of the JNA and the people who fought in Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   No.  The texts are all exceptionally favourable, full of praise</P>\n","<P>25    for the soldiers and officers of the JNA during the fighting for Vukovar.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Would you look at the next page, please.  Let's just see what the</P>\n","<P> 2    date is.</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   The 18th, I suppose.  The 18th of November.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Well, move on.  Move on.</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Mr. Milosevic, Dulovic says here one day with volunteers and tank</P>\n","<P> 6    crews in the street fighting for the liberation of Vukovar.  He praises</P>\n","<P> 7    the volunteers who participated in the fighting for Vukovar as part of the</P>\n","<P> 8    JNA.  So this should be noted.</P>\n","<P> 9            Next page, please.  I think that it's very important to point this</P>\n","<P>10    out.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   And the signature is Jovan Dulovic.  What's the title of this</P>\n","<P>12    article?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   The title of this article is \"The Knights of Vukovar.\"</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   And who does it refer to?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   The units of Major Borivoje Tesic on the front line in Vukovar.</P>\n","<P>16    Major Borivoje Tesic I think -- says: \"I think this is the last stage of</P>\n","<P>17    the fighting.  Crews carrying out their tasks successfully and the help of</P>\n","<P>18    brave people is indispensable.\"  It speaks of Croatian Ustasha and so on.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic</P>\n","<P>22    said volunteers as part of JNA.  Could you show us the passage where</P>\n","<P>23    Mr. Dulovic said so?</P>\n","<P>24            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He says here:  \"One day with</P>\n","<P>25    volunteers and tank crews in the street fighting for the liberation of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Vukovar.\"  This is above the headline.</P>\n","<P> 2            Then he goes on to say:  \"Speaking favourably of Stanko Vujanovic,</P>\n","<P> 3    he says the commander of the 1st Company of the Territorial Defence of</P>\n","<P> 4    Vukovar who is said to be a man who knows no fear.\" It's quite difficult</P>\n","<P> 5    to read this.  My eyesight is not so good and this is not very legible.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Can it be enlarged?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   \"With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making</P>\n","<P> 9    openings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze</P>\n","<P>10    through and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.  The house in</P>\n","<P>11    which they stopped in Prugomijska [phoen] Street near the Brdo cafe is</P>\n","<P>12    under constant fire by snipers whose positionings are very difficult to</P>\n","<P>13    discern.\"</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE KWON:  Now, Mr. Seselj, I would like see to see the passage</P>\n","<P>15    which shows that they were part of JNA as you indicated.  Or was it your</P>\n","<P>16    comment?</P>\n","<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  Please.  In the entire text the</P>\n","<P>18    volunteers are spoken of as members of the JNA.  We have passage here in</P>\n","<P>19    the third column where it says it's in the late afternoon and the fighting</P>\n","<P>20    is dying down.  The volunteers --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Could you use the pointer.  And you indicate on the</P>\n","<P>22    newspaper on the ELMO, not your monitor.  Yes.</P>\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] \"It's late in the afternoon and the</P>\n","<P>24    fighting is dying down.  The volunteers have pierced deep, and they have</P>\n","<P>25    conquered territory between the enemy forces.  The fighters will stay here</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    until the morning.  There were no casualties today except for one soldier</P>\n","<P> 2    who was killed, and his name was Vignjevic.\"</P>\n","<P> 3            He then says:  \"We are going back while shells are flying over our</P>\n","<P> 4    heads and Howitzer shells and so on.\"</P>\n","<P> 5            This whole text implies that the volunteers why part of the JNA.</P>\n","<P> 6    Mr. Kwon, you have here an order showing that these volunteers joined the</P>\n","<P> 7    1st Guards Brigade.  The order was delivered to the OTP from Belgrade and</P>\n","<P> 8    it's beyond dispute.</P>\n","<P> 9            In the Vukovar, there were no troops outside the JNA.  There were</P>\n","<P>10    no paramilitary units.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  It is your comment.  I really didn't see any</P>\n","<P>12    concrete -- the description these volunteers as part of JNA by</P>\n","<P>13    Mr. Dulovic.</P>\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have to read the whole text and</P>\n","<P>15    everything will become clear to you.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE KWON:  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Look at the next page, please.  The following text or this one</P>\n","<P>19    again says the Knights of Vukovar, Major Borivoje Tesic's units on the</P>\n","<P>20    front line, and this is a large article which seems not to be by Dulovic,</P>\n","<P>21    but on the left-hand side there is a small one:  \"Brave commander falls,</P>\n","<P>22    Borovo Selo.\"  Would you look at the signature?  I believe it's by</P>\n","<P>23    Dulovic.  Could you scroll up?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   What does it say in the passage marked by yellow?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   The initials \"JD\" mean Jovan Dulovic.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   And what does it say in this last passage?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- \"The inhabitants of the</P>\n","<P> 4    Crepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,</P>\n","<P> 5    who with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village</P>\n","<P> 6    and one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the</P>\n","<P> 7    highest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages.\"</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   And he was killed?</P>\n","<P> 9       A.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives</P>\n","<P>10    him.  Next page.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a</P>\n","<P>12    look?  I haven't had time to look at it all carefully.</P>\n","<P>13       A.   Yes.  There's a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of</P>\n","<P>14    November.  \"Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate</P>\n","<P>15    Vukovar.\"</P>\n","<P>16            In these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate</P>\n","<P>17    Vukovar, and five years later he's saying something completely different.</P>\n","<P>18             \"Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in</P>\n","<P>19    Vukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb.\"  And then it</P>\n","<P>20    says:  \"The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back,\" and so on</P>\n","<P>21    and so forth.</P>\n","<P>22            So this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the</P>\n","<P>23    JNA.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It's been circled.</P>\n","<P>25       A.   Yes.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Very well.</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   The 4th of November, 1991.  \"For two days fierce fighting has not</P>\n","<P> 3    stopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in</P>\n","<P> 4    flames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of</P>\n","<P> 5    Njusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the</P>\n","<P> 6    Territorial Defence.  Advances by Territorial Defence units and volunteers</P>\n","<P> 7    from the direction of Trpinja stopped on the edge of Borovo Naselje.\"</P>\n","<P> 8            He then speaks of a Croatian mortar attack on Bobota [phoen] and</P>\n","<P> 9    so on.</P>\n","<P>10       Q.   Is this another report by Dulovic?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes, it's signed by Jovan Dulovic.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Is there anything else, any other report?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   I'm looking at another text here but I can't see whether it's by</P>\n","<P>14    Dulovic or not because it's not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian</P>\n","<P>15    volunteer guard but again a very favourable text.  I couldn't see -- I</P>\n","<P>16    can't see the name of the author here.  I can't see it on this page.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Is there anything else underneath, another report?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   \"Who are the volunteers,\" is the next title.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Well, I can't see anything anymore.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced</P>\n","<P>21    through the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is \"Through the holes</P>\n","<P>22    to the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>23    Unknown ammunition with inhumane bullets.\"</P>\n","<P>24            What happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used</P>\n","<P>25    weapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    because the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal</P>\n","<P> 2    organs.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I can't see what it says here in yellow, highlighted</P>\n","<P> 4    in yellow.</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It's Major Radic now</P>\n","<P> 6    who also stands accused in The Hague.  \"Throughout the month of October,</P>\n","<P> 7    the fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in</P>\n","<P> 8    the clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least</P>\n","<P> 9    one person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja</P>\n","<P>10    [phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in</P>\n","<P>11    that way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had</P>\n","<P>12    taken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.</P>\n","<P>13    The snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own</P>\n","<P>14    control and then a solution was found to move through the houses.\"</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic's article</P>\n","<P>16    again?</P>\n","<P>17       A.   Well, it's not legible but it is a series of articles by him.  We</P>\n","<P>18    can't find a signature here but quite obviously it is a series of articles</P>\n","<P>19    by him.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  Is that a series of articles to which you</P>\n","<P>21    referred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect</P>\n","<P>22    to Dulovic's testimony?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   Yes.  But this isn't the complete material.  My legal advisors</P>\n","<P>24    found many more texts of this kind and they quote them in extenso, and in</P>\n","<P>25    my submission I state my intention to disclose them in keeping with</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Rule 67 of the rules of evidence.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, I have one more question</P>\n","<P> 3    [as interpreted] -- Robinson, I have a question for you.  As my associates</P>\n","<P> 4    have managed to come by a set of these or at least photocopies of the</P>\n","<P> 5    papers from 1991 which Mr. Seselj refers to in his submission to the other</P>\n","<P> 6    side, the presentation of these photocopies, is that sufficient grounds</P>\n","<P> 7    for my request that they be accepted as exhibits, that Mr. Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 8    submission be accepted as an exhibit?</P>\n","<P> 9            MR. NICE:  Rather interesting issues, I think, arise on the</P>\n","<P>10    validity of these documents as exhibits, and it may be necessary to go</P>\n","<P>11    back and remind ourselves of what Mr. Dulovic himself said about these</P>\n","<P>12    matters.  So I would respectfully invite the Chamber to put that matter</P>\n","<P>13    back.  But may we see the -- may we have access to this material tonight</P>\n","<P>14    in copy form in any event?  It may be we have them elsewhere, but it will</P>\n","<P>15    be a difficult task to find them and it may in any event not be an</P>\n","<P>16    identical collection.  I simply don't know.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, we'll have to consider the</P>\n","<P>18    application that you're making.

It's not better.</P>\n","<P>16    [In English] You can try it.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is it any better, Mr. --</P>\n","<P>18            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, now it is better.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Yes, we'll proceed.</P>\n","<P>20            I was recalling for Mr. Kay's benefit, and Mr. Milosevic's, the</P>\n","<P>21    evidence which Mr. Milosevic sought to lead through this witness of what</P>\n","<P>22    he said were discrepancies between Prosecution witnesses Dulovic and</P>\n","<P>23    Anastasijevic's evidence given in this court and evidence which they gave</P>\n","<P>24    in a special court in Belgrade.  I had indicated to him that there are</P>\n","<P>25    other ways of introducing that evidence which he felt was important to his</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    case, and I'm going to ask the assigned counsel to investigate this</P>\n","<P> 2    matter, to get hold of the transcript, and I would leave it to their</P>\n","<P> 3    discretion to -- whether to seek to lead that evidence through whatever</P>\n","<P> 4    means is appropriate.</P>\n","<P> 5            MR.

[Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some</P>\n","<P>22    questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian</P>\n","<P>23    indictment, that have to do with the \"Rump Presidency\" as it's called</P>\n","<P>24    here.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  \"The Rump Presidency</P>\n","<P>25    carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies,\" and so on and so forth, \"had</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    effect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief.\"</P>\n","<P> 2            I'm not going to ask you to repeat what you've already said, but</P>\n","<P> 3    in relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of</P>\n","<P> 4    Serbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they</P>\n","<P> 5    not take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency</P>\n","<P> 6    of the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any</P>\n","<P> 7    objective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from</P>\n","<P> 8    carrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?</P>\n","<P> 9            The question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,</P>\n","<P>10    Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the</P>\n","<P>11    SFRY Presidency in Belgrade?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,</P>\n","<P>13    staying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was</P>\n","<P>14    never a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from</P>\n","<P>15    carrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped</P>\n","<P>16    coming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had</P>\n","<P>17    practically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe</P>\n","<P>18    Mesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying</P>\n","<P>19    that they could not come because they could not strike a balance in</P>\n","<P>20    relation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and</P>\n","<P>21    Montenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.</P>\n","<P>22            The representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were</P>\n","<P>23    not expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was</P>\n","<P>24    actually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display</P>\n","<P>25    such feelings at the time.  It's only when he left Belgrade and when he</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    came back to the Croatian parliament that he said, \"I've completed my</P>\n","<P> 2    duty.  Yugoslavia is no more.\"</P>\n","<P> 3            He pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.</P>\n","<P> 4    Also, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him</P>\n","<P> 5    sufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he</P>\n","<P> 6    condemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most</P>\n","<P> 7    cooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was</P>\n","<P> 8    what he was.</P>\n","<P> 9            I already said that according to the constitution of the then</P>\n","<P>10    Yugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one</P>\n","<P>11    single member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been</P>\n","<P>12    prevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could</P>\n","<P>13    have gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could</P>\n","<P>14    have refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the</P>\n","<P>15    Presidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the</P>\n","<P>16    Presidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed</P>\n","<P>17    within the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably</P>\n","<P>18    before Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a</P>\n","<P>19    Rump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of</P>\n","<P>20    a rump Presidency.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  \"Slobodan Milosevic,</P>\n","<P>24    in his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that</P>\n","<P>25    Yugoslavia was finished.\"</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            Please, you've got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I'm not</P>\n","<P> 2    going to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much</P>\n","<P> 3    time.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to</P>\n","<P> 4    here or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that</P>\n","<P> 5    Yugoslavia was finished?</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say</P>\n","<P> 7    that Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you</P>\n","<P> 8    never said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I</P>\n","<P> 9    remember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the</P>\n","<P>10    behaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went</P>\n","<P>11    through a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,</P>\n","<P>12    constitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,</P>\n","<P>13    but then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional</P>\n","<P>14    provision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases</P>\n","<P>15    to exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the</P>\n","<P>16    matter.</P>\n","<P>17            The leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never</P>\n","<P>18    did it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and</P>\n","<P>19    Croatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and</P>\n","<P>20    Macedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro</P>\n","<P>21    proclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting</P>\n","<P>22    of two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration</P>\n","<P>23    on your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   \"In March 1991 the collective Presidency of the SFRY reached a</P>\n","<P> 2    deadlock on several issues.\"  That is paragraph 56.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... that sentence</P>\n","<P> 4    which is at the beginning of the paragraph.  There's another allegation in</P>\n","<P> 5    that last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no</P>\n","<P> 6    longer be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask</P>\n","<P> 7    Mr. Seselj whether that is so.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember</P>\n","<P> 9    at that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian</P>\n","<P>10    public, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the</P>\n","<P>11    decisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that</P>\n","<P>12    Serbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation</P>\n","<P>13    when the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.</P>\n","<P>14            I would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there</P>\n","<P>15    was a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the</P>\n","<P>16    headquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long</P>\n","<P>17    debate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the</P>\n","<P>18    demand of the military to declare a state of emergency.</P>\n","<P>19            The top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the</P>\n","<P>20    behaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a</P>\n","<P>21    vote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.  As far as I can</P>\n","<P>22    remember --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You have answered the question I asked, thanks.</P>\n","<P>24            Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   That is what is referred to here.  It says the representatives on</P>\n","<P> 2    the Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,</P>\n","<P> 3    the autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of</P>\n","<P> 4    Kosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what</P>\n","<P> 5    was so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the</P>\n","<P> 6    Presidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also</P>\n","<P> 8    start the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven't got the document here</P>\n","<P> 9    so I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were</P>\n","<P>10    actually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already</P>\n","<P>11    started putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the</P>\n","<P>12    Presidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the</P>\n","<P>13    Presidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not</P>\n","<P>14    very constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the</P>\n","<P>15    Presidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,</P>\n","<P>16    or Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.</P>\n","<P>17    I think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been</P>\n","<P>18    recalled in the meantime.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that</P>\n","<P>20    session or before that session or in relation to that session I never</P>\n","<P>21    declared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did</P>\n","<P>22    they declare that Yugoslavia was finished?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   I've already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian</P>\n","<P>24    politicians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was</P>\n","<P>25    one of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    hard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.</P>\n","<P> 2            As for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in</P>\n","<P> 3    Montenegro either.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to</P>\n","<P> 5    normal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic</P>\n","<P> 6    was elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented</P>\n","<P> 7    Vojvodina at the time.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the</P>\n","<P> 9    Presidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started</P>\n","<P>10    working again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its</P>\n","<P>11    work.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of</P>\n","<P>12    Bosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil</P>\n","<P>13    Tupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new</P>\n","<P>14    crisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be</P>\n","<P>15    elected president of the Presidency.</P>\n","<P>16            There was a principle involved that the president of the</P>\n","<P>17    Presidency was elected from a different republican province every year but</P>\n","<P>18    nobody's election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic</P>\n","<P>19    did not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European</P>\n","<P>20    envoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to</P>\n","<P>21    elect him nevertheless.</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting</P>\n","<P>24    the preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from</P>\n","<P>25    those positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says</P>\n","<P> 2    that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and</P>\n","<P> 3    discussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between</P>\n","<P> 4    Serbia and Croatia?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I</P>\n","<P> 6    remember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what</P>\n","<P> 7    was skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching</P>\n","<P> 8    agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the</P>\n","<P> 9    Bosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a</P>\n","<P>10    situation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it</P>\n","<P>11    increasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the</P>\n","<P>12    country at the time.</P>\n","<P>13            At that time, I -- as I've already said, the presidents of the</P>\n","<P>14    presidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys</P>\n","<P>15    had actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach</P>\n","<P>16    agreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia</P>\n","<P>17    increasingly so.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through</P>\n","<P>19    what medium?</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully</P>\n","<P>21    being bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media</P>\n","<P>22    this kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were</P>\n","<P>23    already at that time being financed from the West by different Western</P>\n","<P>24    intelligence agencies, so that's the kind of media I'm talking about.  In</P>\n","<P>25    Belgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    federal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic</P>\n","<P> 2    government, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government</P>\n","<P> 3    in Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the</P>\n","<P> 4    Western powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante</P>\n","<P> 5    Markovic's government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible</P>\n","<P> 6    agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 7    together under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been</P>\n","<P> 8    eliminated.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at</P>\n","<P>12    one stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence</P>\n","<P>13    counsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest</P>\n","<P>14    collaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This</P>\n","<P>15    denies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of</P>\n","<P>16    Bosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted</P>\n","<P>17    into evidence and if not we will find this transcript.</P>\n","<P>18            However, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with</P>\n","<P>19    you as you were an active participant in all political events.  This</P>\n","<P>20    meeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the</P>\n","<P>21    division of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any</P>\n","<P>22    member of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning</P>\n","<P>23    of which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way</P>\n","<P>24    even indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    if Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 2    as an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as</P>\n","<P> 3    a constituent nation as they had been before in the previous</P>\n","<P> 4    constitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the</P>\n","<P> 5    first president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it</P>\n","<P> 6    was not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint</P>\n","<P> 7    state.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans</P>\n","<P> 8    persuaded him to call off the agreement.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It</P>\n","<P>10    says:  \"On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY</P>\n","<P>11    Presidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,</P>\n","<P>12    Sejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY</P>\n","<P>13    Presidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the</P>\n","<P>14    Presidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and</P>\n","<P>15    Macedonia.\"</P>\n","<P>16            On the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.  Was this</P>\n","<P>17    a kind of takeover of the function of the Presidency or were these</P>\n","<P>18    functions being carried out by the legal representatives?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   There was absolutely no takeover.  When four of the members of the</P>\n","<P>20    Presidency withdrew and some of them officially gave notice that they were</P>\n","<P>21    no longer members, like Drnovsek, for instance, while others simply</P>\n","<P>22    stopped attending the sessions.  The Presidency continued working with the</P>\n","<P>23    members who -- whom it was possible to gather together.</P>\n","<P>24            I suggest that the Chamber get hold of this piece of legislation.</P>\n","<P>25    I cannot quote it verbatim right now, but I'm absolutely sure it existed.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    And according to this piece of legislation, even if the majority of</P>\n","<P> 2    members could not meet, the Presidency under certain circumstances would</P>\n","<P> 3    continue working with the members who were present.</P>\n","<P> 4            Let me remind you that in the spring of 1991 or in the early</P>\n","<P> 5    summer, there was a vote taken to declare a imminent threat of war.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 65 it says:  \"On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,</P>\n","<P> 7    Slobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal</P>\n","<P> 8    enterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from</P>\n","<P> 9    Belgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the</P>\n","<P>10    mobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay</P>\n","<P>11    in Yugoslavia.\"</P>\n","<P>12            First of all, let's establish when I began advocating a unitary</P>\n","<P>13    Serb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And</P>\n","<P>14    secondly, was this anyone's idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,</P>\n","<P>15    and is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever</P>\n","<P>16    been a unitary state?</P>\n","<P>17       A.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as</P>\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally</P>\n","<P>19    and your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt</P>\n","<P>20    the new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the</P>\n","<P>21    autonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the</P>\n","<P>22    Serb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of</P>\n","<P>23    autonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an</P>\n","<P>24    option.</P>\n","<P>25            Furthermore, when the four former federal units had already been</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    recognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the</P>\n","<P> 2    Montenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be</P>\n","<P> 3    promulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump</P>\n","<P> 4    Yugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would</P>\n","<P> 5    have been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -</P>\n","<P> 6    because that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary</P>\n","<P> 7    Serbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this</P>\n","<P> 8    but didn't want to, and I am sorry that you didn't do that, because up to</P>\n","<P> 9    the point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --</P>\n","<P>10    in Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It</P>\n","<P>11    appeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any</P>\n","<P>13    of my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who</P>\n","<P>14    were allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had</P>\n","<P>15    any kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated</P>\n","<P>17    with you advocated such an idea.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it</P>\n","<P>19    says here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of</P>\n","<P>20    reservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the</P>\n","<P>21    reasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was</P>\n","<P>22    called for?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   I'm not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation</P>\n","<P>24    of reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to</P>\n","<P>25    mobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    to take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the</P>\n","<P> 2    territorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that</P>\n","<P> 3    this mobilisation didn't go well.  The response was very poor, because</P>\n","<P> 4    Veljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn't want to remove the</P>\n","<P> 5    communist insignia from the military uniforms.</P>\n","<P> 6            The Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the</P>\n","<P> 7    Presidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was</P>\n","<P> 8    Prime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in</P>\n","<P> 9    Slovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of</P>\n","<P>10    such an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops</P>\n","<P>11    into Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then</P>\n","<P>12    leadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as</P>\n","<P>13    I know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership</P>\n","<P>14    which had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your</P>\n","<P>16    name, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask</P>\n","<P>17    you now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of</P>\n","<P>18    April, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan's and</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you</P>\n","<P>20    know anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and</P>\n","<P>21    cart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of</P>\n","<P>22    cooperation with Arkan's volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>24    did not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert</P>\n","<P>25    that, I'm saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    organised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as</P>\n","<P> 2    much as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.</P>\n","<P> 3    That's a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P> 4    Radical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty</P>\n","<P> 5    to Serbia.  I guarantee that.</P>\n","<P> 6            The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict</P>\n","<P> 7    instructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb</P>\n","<P> 8    volunteer guard up to the --</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm asking why was that instruction given to the</P>\n","<P>10    volunteers of the Serb Radical Party?</P>\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.</P>\n","<P>12    We didn't want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn't</P>\n","<P>13    want people's awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.</P>\n","<P>14            As I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,</P>\n","<P>15    long before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had</P>\n","<P>16    quarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was</P>\n","<P>17    in danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this</P>\n","<P>18    in the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding</P>\n","<P>20    that instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with</P>\n","<P>21    Arkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You're</P>\n","<P>22    not there with them.</P>\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can't say that not a single</P>\n","<P>24    volunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There's one</P>\n","<P>25    instance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    teacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 2    Party.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of</P>\n","<P> 3    about 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back</P>\n","<P> 4    but, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of</P>\n","<P> 5    Arkan's men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.</P>\n","<P> 6            So, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint</P>\n","<P> 7    military activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with</P>\n","<P> 8    Arkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a</P>\n","<P> 9    distance from Arkan.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.</P>\n","<P>11            Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on</P>\n","<P>14    transcript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia</P>\n","<P>15    took place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj's</P>\n","<P>16    White Eagles.</P>\n","<P>17            First of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and</P>\n","<P>18    secondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj's White Eagles?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb</P>\n","<P>20    people organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have</P>\n","<P>21    already said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of</P>\n","<P>22    volunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After</P>\n","<P>23    that, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we</P>\n","<P>24    had volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never</P>\n","<P>25    had anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            There was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo</P>\n","<P> 2    Selo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he</P>\n","<P> 3    was killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not</P>\n","<P> 4    carrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no</P>\n","<P> 5    joint military activities.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Let's clarify this.  It doesn't say here that you cooperated.  It</P>\n","<P> 7    says here:  \"With infiltration of Seselj's White Eagles.\"  So the White</P>\n","<P> 8    Eagles are being ascribed to you.</P>\n","<P> 9       A.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the</P>\n","<P>10    Prosecutor bringing witnesses here who don't no anything about what</P>\n","<P>11    happened on the ground.  It's simply nonsense to talk of a group called</P>\n","<P>12    Seselj's White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and</P>\n","<P>13    the Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn't know</P>\n","<P>14    what he was talking about.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,</P>\n","<P>16    2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that \"Seselj collected men in</P>\n","<P>17    Erdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia.\"  Is that</P>\n","<P>18    true, Mr. Seselj?</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493</P>\n","<P>20    who testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake</P>\n","<P>22    in my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that</P>\n","<P>23    particular page, and the page is 19003.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    them to Bosnia?</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in</P>\n","<P> 3    Erdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,</P>\n","<P> 4    nicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only</P>\n","<P> 5    time.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --</P>\n","<P> 6    we never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there</P>\n","<P> 7    either, and I can state that quite categorically.</P>\n","<P> 8            The people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the</P>\n","<P> 9    war and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were</P>\n","<P>10    exclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I</P>\n","<P>11    absolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan's centre in Erdut</P>\n","<P>12    later on.  We never had anything to do with it.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is</P>\n","<P>14    20294, says that Arkan's and Seselj's men shot above the heads of the</P>\n","<P>15    civilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in</P>\n","<P>16    Bratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who</P>\n","<P>17    mistreated and abused the civilians?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian</P>\n","<P>19    Radical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my</P>\n","<P>20    knowledge Arkan didn't appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in</P>\n","<P>21    Zvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in</P>\n","<P>22    Bratunac either.  And I've already said that in Bratunac there was</P>\n","<P>23    Deronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there</P>\n","<P>24    I was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have</P>\n","<P>25    very certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj's men were</P>\n","<P> 2    in Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 3    mean there is no difference, says he.</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can't see any</P>\n","<P> 5    difference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the</P>\n","<P> 6    White Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at</P>\n","<P> 7    all.  And that's not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some</P>\n","<P> 8    judgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to</P>\n","<P> 9    see in some other places Seselj's White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the</P>\n","<P>10    problem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses</P>\n","<P>11    which it manipulates.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on</P>\n","<P>13    several occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --</P>\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven't been able to check this myself</P>\n","<P>15    because the accused hasn't been getting the references correct, and it's</P>\n","<P>16    quite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I'm grateful to</P>\n","<P>17    Ms. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came</P>\n","<P>18    (redacted).</P>\n","<P>19    But, really, I'm afraid we've got to have correct references for the</P>\n","<P>20    witnesses.  We can't simply just go to the page in the transcript.</P>\n","<P>21    Frequently our page numbers don't necessarily coincide here in court, and</P>\n","<P>22    without reference to the witnesses it's very difficult to pick it up</P>\n","<P>23    later.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in</P>\n","<P>25    pinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you're referring.  Now,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Judge Kwon has already corrected you once, and apparently there is another</P>\n","<P> 2    mistake in the reference.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, perhaps there might be a</P>\n","<P> 4    mistake with the name, but there is no mistake with the quotation from the</P>\n","<P> 5    transcript, and my question relates to the material facts which are being</P>\n","<P> 6    mentioned here.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, we have to follow it, Mr. Milosevic.  There</P>\n","<P> 8    is duty on you to be more careful.</P>\n","<P> 9            Please proceed.</P>\n","<P>10            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. Robinson.  And I'll</P>\n","<P>11    check this out to see whether indeed it is the same witness from</P>\n","<P>12    page 20352, the transcript line and page, the quotation that I mentioned</P>\n","<P>13    earlier on or, rather, 20351 is the exact number.  I'll check that out</P>\n","<P>14    during the break.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript</P>\n","<P>17    said that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of</P>\n","<P>18    March, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan's men took part as well as</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the</P>\n","<P>20    occupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on</P>\n","<P>21    the 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of</P>\n","<P>22    your volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What</P>\n","<P>24    happened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between</P>\n","<P>25    the JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Muslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.</P>\n","<P> 2    However, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went</P>\n","<P> 3    on for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting</P>\n","<P> 4    the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was</P>\n","<P> 5    there, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my</P>\n","<P> 6    knowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of</P>\n","<P> 7    the local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to</P>\n","<P> 8    establish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the</P>\n","<P> 9    ground there.</P>\n","<P>10            I know -- have reliable information that the commands and the</P>\n","<P>11    officers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan's and</P>\n","<P>12    the Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a</P>\n","<P>13    great deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very</P>\n","<P>14    rarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.</P>\n","<P>15            As far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,</P>\n","<P>16    over there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did</P>\n","<P>17    appear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the</P>\n","<P>18    call of Biljana Plavsic.  I can't prove that, but I do know that Biljana</P>\n","<P>19    Plavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly</P>\n","<P>20    meeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The</P>\n","<P>21    volunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina</P>\n","<P>22    were not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the</P>\n","<P>23    Serbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were</P>\n","<P>24    residents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the</P>\n","<P>25    conflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    and Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan's right-hand man.  And in</P>\n","<P> 2    Serbia we didn't send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something</P>\n","<P> 4    for me in relation to the Prosecution's case.  In the Bosnia indictment</P>\n","<P> 5    the allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other</P>\n","<P> 6    members of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the</P>\n","<P> 7    Prosecution case unfolded, you're not saying, are you, that he acted</P>\n","<P> 8    alone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with</P>\n","<P> 9    other members of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven't reviewed each and every allegation</P>\n","<P>11    to check that there isn't one there that may be susceptible to individual</P>\n","<P>12    perpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he's working with others.</P>\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually</P>\n","<P>16    your case.  It's not that he acted alone.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. NICE:  Subject to the point I've just made.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you've made, yes.</P>\n","<P>19            MR. NICE:  Yes.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Very well, Mr. Seselj.  You've just heard that explanation too.</P>\n","<P>23    Now, since you know the relationships very well between people at that</P>\n","<P>24    time, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and</P>\n","<P>25    Zvornik yourself.  Now, did I or any organs of power and authority have</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    anything to do with Arkan's volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and</P>\n","<P> 4    I think perhaps there's this qualification, although I don't think it is a</P>\n","<P> 5    qualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this</P>\n","<P> 6    accused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top</P>\n","<P> 7    political level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are</P>\n","<P> 8    criminal in nature.  It's the standard method of generation of</P>\n","<P> 9    genocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar</P>\n","<P>10    [phoen].</P>\n","<P>11            Now, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other</P>\n","<P>12    people.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may</P>\n","<P>13    be minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in</P>\n","<P>14    those circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting</P>\n","<P>15    alone in certain circumstances, but that's the only qualification I think</P>\n","<P>16    I should make.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it's a point that will warrant some</P>\n","<P>18    consideration later on, yes.</P>\n","<P>19            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>20            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   So Arkan is mentioned here as well as Mauzer.  Did I or anybody</P>\n","<P>22    else from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all</P>\n","<P>23    and with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   I'm quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.</P>\n","<P>25    On the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    contacts with Arkan.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many</P>\n","<P> 3    questions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the</P>\n","<P> 4    evidence he's giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,</P>\n","<P> 5    how is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan</P>\n","<P> 6    or Mauzer?</P>\n","<P> 7            He's giving evidence.  He's saying that you had nothing to do with</P>\n","<P> 8    him.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to</P>\n","<P> 9    establish how he's in a position to make that statement.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that</P>\n","<P>12    cannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from</P>\n","<P>13    the authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or</P>\n","<P>14    relationship with Arkan or Mauzer?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   In Belgrade you couldn't hide anything like that.  It would be</P>\n","<P>16    impossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is</P>\n","<P>17    that kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become</P>\n","<P>18    public.</P>\n","<P>19            Second, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts</P>\n","<P>20    only with Zoran Djindjic.  And I've already spoken about the relationship</P>\n","<P>21    between Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic's vice-president and the</P>\n","<P>22    president of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his</P>\n","<P>23    pre-electoral campaign.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   Let's clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did</P>\n","<P>25    you have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    able to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in</P>\n","<P> 2    Bijeljina?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina</P>\n","<P> 4    sufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,</P>\n","<P> 5    including Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this</P>\n","<P> 6    trial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events</P>\n","<P> 7    that went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in</P>\n","<P> 8    Bijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements</P>\n","<P> 9    and held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and</P>\n","<P>10    severely criticised Mauzer's conduct, especially Mauzer's conduct towards</P>\n","<P>11    the Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am</P>\n","<P>12    preparing them for my own trial, which doesn't seem to be starting.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack</P>\n","<P>14    on the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the</P>\n","<P>15    JNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by</P>\n","<P>16    the Red Berets or, rather, Arkan's and Seselj's men.  So that's the</P>\n","<P>17    quotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan's</P>\n","<P>18    and Seselj's men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red</P>\n","<P>19    Berets were they?  What Arkan's men were they, Seselj's men were they</P>\n","<P>20    around Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the</P>\n","<P>22    witness don't seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened</P>\n","<P>23    to see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red</P>\n","<P>24    cap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.</P>\n","<P>25    And then he -- the witness doesn't know whether they were Seselj's men or</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Arkan's men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it's</P>\n","<P> 2    highly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of</P>\n","<P> 3    his head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify</P>\n","<P> 4    so-called Seselj's men and Arkan's men and these alleged Red Berets.</P>\n","<P> 5            As for the Red Berets, I've already given you reliable facts about</P>\n","<P> 6    them and said that name appeared in different situations relating to</P>\n","<P> 7    different military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina</P>\n","<P> 8    area where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then</P>\n","<P> 9    the army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of</P>\n","<P>10    the intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until</P>\n","<P>11    the special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of</P>\n","<P>12    Serbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this</P>\n","<P>13    misunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed</P>\n","<P>14    to people with -- which they had nothing to do with.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the</P>\n","<P>16    following:  \"Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P>17    who were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done.\"</P>\n","<P>18    That's when this witness claims.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He's a colonel by</P>\n","<P>20    rank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff</P>\n","<P>21    of the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the</P>\n","<P>22    number two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that's the same</P>\n","<P>23    Osman Selak that you're referring to.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   Well, I can't tell you that.</P>\n","<P>25       A.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a</P>\n","<P> 2    statement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,</P>\n","<P> 3    what the circumstances were in which I said it.</P>\n","<P> 4            I did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the</P>\n","<P> 5    secession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia</P>\n","<P> 6    seceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,</P>\n","<P> 7    and for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he</P>\n","<P> 8    personally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.</P>\n","<P> 9            As far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from</P>\n","<P>10    Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of</P>\n","<P>11    Yugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and</P>\n","<P>12    Raska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of</P>\n","<P>13    examples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army</P>\n","<P>14    perform their duty very honourably.</P>\n","<P>15            So the citizens --</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are</P>\n","<P>18    saying that you did make such a statement or you didn't make such a</P>\n","<P>19    statement.</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if</P>\n","<P>21    you don't show me something like that here, where and when.  Let us see</P>\n","<P>22    the statement concerned.  Let me identify it.  I gave thousands and</P>\n","<P>23    thousands of statements in public.  They were publicly recorded.  They</P>\n","<P>24    were published.  So let's see.</P>\n","<P>25            My objection is precisely in that.  Why did this Osman Selak not</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    say where and when?</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's helpful to some extent.  Does it follow from</P>\n","<P> 3    the answer you've just given that you could have said it?</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I could have said it along the</P>\n","<P> 5    following lines, that those in the army who came from the renegade</P>\n","<P> 6    republics in principle should not remain at positions in the Yugoslav</P>\n","<P> 7    army.  You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live</P>\n","<P> 8    in Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in</P>\n","<P> 9    the army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as</P>\n","<P>10    officers?</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's simply confusing me further.  The quote was</P>\n","<P>12    that you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims</P>\n","<P>13    and Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that</P>\n","<P>14    you could possibly have made that statement in these terms?</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not saying that I made that kind</P>\n","<P>16    of statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak</P>\n","<P>17    testified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise</P>\n","<P>18    lines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman</P>\n","<P>19    Selak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be</P>\n","<P>20    established.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the</P>\n","<P>21    Prosecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly</P>\n","<P>22    what I said.</P>\n","<P>23            I am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,</P>\n","<P>24    but it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you're asking me to do is</P>\n","<P>25    to comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Selak's view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make</P>\n","<P> 2    my statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm</P>\n","<P> 4    trying to understand the answer you've given to the question asked by</P>\n","<P> 5    Mr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you've just said, the problem is</P>\n","<P> 6    that you've been studying this yourself, and you're trying to justify a</P>\n","<P> 7    position of your own without really dealing specifically with the question</P>\n","<P> 8    that's being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears</P>\n","<P> 9    now to be that you couldn't possibly have made a statement of that nature,</P>\n","<P>10    although you might have said something much more specific about different</P>\n","<P>11    people but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.</P>\n","<P>12            Now, is that a fair summary of your position?</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I'm not sure, by think you're</P>\n","<P>14    very close.  However, in order to help you, I'm going to give you an</P>\n","<P>15    example.</P>\n","<P>16            Throughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were</P>\n","<P>17    informed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,</P>\n","<P>18    escaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of</P>\n","<P>19    confidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998</P>\n","<P>20    we had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of</P>\n","<P>21    the military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his</P>\n","<P>22    family abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives</P>\n","<P>23    there.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn't remotely sound as if it's</P>\n","<P>25    going to be at all helpful to me, so we'll proceed with Mr. Milosevic's</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    questions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you</P>\n","<P> 2    was about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist</P>\n","<P> 3    statement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple</P>\n","<P> 4    issue I'm not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further</P>\n","<P> 5    if he wishes.</P>\n","<P> 6            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in</P>\n","<P>11    no uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that</P>\n","<P>12    any statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never</P>\n","<P>13    in my life have I made a racist statement.</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>\n","<P>19            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  There's nothing for you to respond to.</P>\n","<P>21            Mr. Milosevic, the next question.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I'm afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I</P>\n","<P>24    put a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific</P>\n","<P>25    terms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    here that \"Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia</P>\n","<P> 2    who were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed.\"  Did you ever state</P>\n","<P> 3    that?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I didn't say it that way.</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   So you didn't say it that way --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... matter.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  And why on earth it should take all this time to</P>\n","<P> 8    establish that simple issue, I do not know.</P>\n","<P> 9            Perhaps it would help, Mr. Seselj, if you just listened to the</P>\n","<P>10    questions and answer the question that's actually asked rather than try to</P>\n","<P>11    make political statements about your own position.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic --</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not making political statements,</P>\n","<P>14    Mr. Bonomy.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He</P>\n","<P>17    mentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether</P>\n","<P>18    those facts are correct.  And first of all, I'm interested in the</P>\n","<P>19    circumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  \"Just after</P>\n","<P>20    the bombing Seselj came to Pale.\"  And then on page 26762 he</P>\n","<P>21    says:  \"Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to</P>\n","<P>22    support the Bosnian Serbs.\"  These are a few facts that referred to.</P>\n","<P>23    Could you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this</P>\n","<P>24    actually all about?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the</P>\n","<P> 2    leadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly</P>\n","<P> 3    engaged in an anti-Serb policy.</P>\n","<P> 4            As for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market</P>\n","<P> 5    itself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the</P>\n","<P> 6    street of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these</P>\n","<P> 7    are explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of</P>\n","<P> 8    whether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar</P>\n","<P> 9    shells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.</P>\n","<P>10            This was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the</P>\n","<P>11    Serbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the</P>\n","<P>12    threats that were made, and so on and so forth.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there</P>\n","<P>14    you did so only to give political support to the leadership of</P>\n","<P>15    Republika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and</P>\n","<P>16    bombing.</P>\n","<P>17       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  \"In January or February</P>\n","<P>19    1992\" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, \"Arkan's</P>\n","<P>20    and Seselj's units arrived in Doboj.\"</P>\n","<P>21            Is this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?</P>\n","<P>22       A.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,</P>\n","<P>23    there were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.</P>\n","<P>24            Secondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to</P>\n","<P>25    Doboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan's Tigers never</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    operated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to</P>\n","<P> 3    this question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript page 27738, quite explicitly, \"Mirko Blagojevic,\" that is to</P>\n","<P> 5    say, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he</P>\n","<P> 6    says:  \"Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,</P>\n","<P> 7    and he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with</P>\n","<P> 8    Seselj.\"</P>\n","<P> 9            I am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>10    Party or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that</P>\n","<P>11    Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So</P>\n","<P>12    please deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the</P>\n","<P>13    transcript.  Is it correct or not?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is</P>\n","<P>15    organised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A</P>\n","<P>16    conflict occurs when two armed formations clash.</P>\n","<P>17            Mirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in</P>\n","<P>18    Bijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim</P>\n","<P>19    formations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any</P>\n","<P>20    conflicts.  And I guarantee with my own life that he took part in no</P>\n","<P>21    looting, no persecutions, no maltreatment of the civilian population and</P>\n","<P>22    so on and so forth.  I'm absolutely certain of that.</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Thank you.</P>\n","<P>24       A.   I can fully identify with everything that Mirko Blagojevic did.</P>\n","<P>25    It is to that degree that I'm certain that he never did anything against</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the law.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  \"Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 3    men tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm.\"</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   My understanding is it's somewhere near Zvornik.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   That's quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 7    Party took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there</P>\n","<P> 8    in brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on</P>\n","<P> 9    for a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the</P>\n","<P>10    Muslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to</P>\n","<P>11    an end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>12    withdrew.</P>\n","<P>13            I preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on</P>\n","<P>14    guarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing</P>\n","<P>15    happened, I would have had to know about it.</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you</P>\n","<P>17    personally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following</P>\n","<P>18    circumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  \"Seselj,</P>\n","<P>19    on Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired</P>\n","<P>20    it at Muslims in Sarajevo.\"  This was shown on television, and he said</P>\n","<P>21    that you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at</P>\n","<P>23    Grbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called</P>\n","<P>24    international observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go</P>\n","<P>25    around the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Serb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was</P>\n","<P> 2    an apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I</P>\n","<P> 3    used a Browning machine-gun from there.  It's a heavy machine-gun.  I</P>\n","<P> 4    couldn't carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry</P>\n","<P> 5    it around.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   You cannot carry it.  It's too long.  It was installed in that</P>\n","<P> 8    building, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches</P>\n","<P> 9    below the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of</P>\n","<P>10    the volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was</P>\n","<P>11    firing from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and</P>\n","<P>12    the top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is</P>\n","<P>13    something I don't know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who</P>\n","<P>14    could have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this</P>\n","<P>15    small participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.</P>\n","<P>16            A Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that</P>\n","<P>17    case, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been</P>\n","<P>18    forced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of</P>\n","<P>19    those who in violation of international law of war brought him out there</P>\n","<P>20    to dig trenches, not those who --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,</P>\n","<P>24    that at the beginning of April Seselj's men arrived in the area of</P>\n","<P>25    Bratunac and Zvornik.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic's part.  He knows</P>\n","<P> 2    full well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing</P>\n","<P> 3    who he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and</P>\n","<P> 4    making this sweeping statement Seselj's men arrived in Bratunac and</P>\n","<P> 5    Zvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it's as if they were in Bratunac</P>\n","<P> 6    too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so</P>\n","<P> 7    Deronjic invented that.</P>\n","<P> 8            In Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the</P>\n","<P> 9    Bratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was</P>\n","<P>10    commander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he</P>\n","<P>11    was not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,</P>\n","<P>12    then a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.  I think the interpreter is having</P>\n","<P>14    some difficulty.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will.</P>\n","<P>16            You could have noticed, Mr. Robinson, that I have been trying as</P>\n","<P>17    of late to speak slowly, but sometimes, every now and then, I may forget</P>\n","<P>18    what you cautioned me about.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, I had noticed, and the -- we are</P>\n","<P>20    appreciative of the effort you are making.  You have answered the</P>\n","<P>21    question.</P>\n","<P>22            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the meantime --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think you have answered that question.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   So they were not in Bratunac at all?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in</P>\n","<P> 2    Bratunac.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   All right.  So you are saying that he's not telling the truth.</P>\n","<P> 4            The same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not</P>\n","<P> 5    agree that Seselj was a true opposition.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.   The Hague OTP and Judge Schomburg on several occasions caught</P>\n","<P> 7    Deronjic lying.  And even in Deronjic's judgement you can find about seven</P>\n","<P> 8    different points as ascertained by Judge Schomburg, namely that Deronjic</P>\n","<P> 9    was lying.</P>\n","<P>10            Secondly, in the case of people who are inclined to a pro-Western</P>\n","<P>11    policy or are mercenaries of Western intelligence agencies, or in order to</P>\n","<P>12    save their own skin they go into plea bargaining with the OTP and</P>\n","<P>13    therefore appear as witnesses in the trials of other people, it can often</P>\n","<P>14    be heard that those who are really opposition but are not prepared to</P>\n","<P>15    serve the West --</P>\n","<P>16            MR. NICE:  I'm not sure this is responsive to any question --</P>\n","<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Are you interrupting me?</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet, Mr. Seselj, and he's</P>\n","<P>19    entitled to make an objection if he wishes.</P>\n","<P>20            MR. NICE:  He was simply asked if the man was telling the truth.</P>\n","<P>21    We have his answer and he's now gone on to a long comment basically.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, you have moved into the area of comment.</P>\n","<P>23            It's now time for the break.</P>\n","<P>24            Mr. Nice, I should say the question that I asked earlier related</P>\n","<P>25    to the Bosnia indictment.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            We will break for 20 minutes.</P>\n","<P> 2                          --- Recess taken at 3.41 p.m.</P>\n","<P> 3                          --- On resuming at 4.08 p.m.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, you told me to check</P>\n","<P> 6    the pages that Mr. Nice mentioned, 35 -- 20352 and 20351, that is.  This</P>\n","<P> 7    was Witness 1070.</P>\n","<P> 8            On page 20351 he says that Seselj's men were in Bratunac and that</P>\n","<P> 9    there was no difference between them and Seselj's men, the White Eagles,</P>\n","<P>10    that is.</P>\n","<P>11            And on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April</P>\n","<P>12    Seselj's and Arkan's men were in Bratunac together when some people were</P>\n","<P>13    deported.  And Mr. Seselj answered questions about this.  In the meantime,</P>\n","<P>14    the liaison officer had the transcript, and I have received a note saying</P>\n","<P>15    that both references are correct, both as regards page 20351 and 20352,</P>\n","<P>16    and these refer to Witness 1070.  There was no error.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  All right, Mr. Milosevic.  We'll do our own</P>\n","<P>18    check.  Thank you for checking anyhow.</P>\n","<P>19            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   Mr. Seselj, this is the testimony of Miroslav Deronjic, who said</P>\n","<P>21    that you were not truly an opposition politician or, rather, that you</P>\n","<P>22    cooperated with the government and that therefore this idea of a joint</P>\n","<P>23    criminal enterprise is thereby confirmed.  Were you in the opposition or</P>\n","<P>24    not?</P>\n","<P>25            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it</P>\n","<P> 2    on.</P>\n","<P> 3            Both the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time</P>\n","<P> 4    were distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as</P>\n","<P> 5    it's possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by</P>\n","<P> 6    Deronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the</P>\n","<P> 7    opposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint</P>\n","<P> 8    often expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various</P>\n","<P> 9    government and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person</P>\n","<P>10    of the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or</P>\n","<P>11    Miles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery</P>\n","<P>12    and so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while</P>\n","<P>13    criticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition</P>\n","<P>14    politicians, and this logic is completely upside down.</P>\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   Witness Ahmet Zulic says, and that's on page 30000 of the</P>\n","<P>17    transcript, he says that Seselj's men were stationed in the partisan</P>\n","<P>18    cemetery in Pobrezje, that doesn't matter so much but what matters is the</P>\n","<P>19    following, that they had come there to kill the Muslims.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Where is this place?  Pobrezje?  Where is it?</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   I have a note here in Pobrezje.  I can't be more specific than</P>\n","<P>22    that.</P>\n","<P>23            But let me put a question to you:  Did your volunteers go anywhere</P>\n","<P>24    to kill all Muslims?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   No.  Nowhere did the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party go to</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    kill Muslims or Croats or any kind of civilians.  Wherever they went, they</P>\n","<P> 2    were part of the JNA, and they went there to fight against the</P>\n","<P> 3    paramilitary units that wanted to break up Yugoslavia.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, it's important to know the</P>\n","<P> 5    location.  I'm not sure whether Mr. Nice or Mr. Kay can help.  Your note</P>\n","<P> 6    doesn't identify clearly the name of this place?</P>\n","<P> 7            MR. NICE:  I tried to make an electronic search but for various</P>\n","<P> 8    reasons it doesn't work at the moment or doesn't work for this witness on</P>\n","<P> 9    this particular part of his evidence.  I'll try again.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  You said Pobrezje.</P>\n","<P>12            Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   The same witness, Ahmet Zulic, on page 30047, says in Sanski Most</P>\n","<P>15    there was no fighting, but the civilians fled because Seselj's men were</P>\n","<P>16    there.</P>\n","<P>17            Your men caused fear among civilians, although there was no</P>\n","<P>18    fighting there, as he says, in Sanski Most.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,</P>\n","<P>20    throughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did</P>\n","<P>21    not fight in any location.</P>\n","<P>22            This reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a</P>\n","<P>23    certain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying</P>\n","<P>24    that sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.</P>\n","<P>25    Somebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    arriving, and he spread panic.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that the Serbian word for</P>\n","<P> 3    sugar resembles Mr. Seselj's name.</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere</P>\n","<P> 5    in that area.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  \"From the</P>\n","<P> 8    1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan</P>\n","<P> 9    Milosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint</P>\n","<P>10    criminal,\" and so on,\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise</P>\n","<P>11    aided and abetted,\" and so on and so forth, all these phrases, \"the</P>\n","<P>12    planning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories</P>\n","<P>13    of Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>\n","<P>14    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.\"</P>\n","<P>15            Tell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in</P>\n","<P>16    this joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged</P>\n","<P>17    crimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made</P>\n","<P>18    here?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from</P>\n","<P>20    Serbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia</P>\n","<P>21    and Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted</P>\n","<P>22    to proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the</P>\n","<P>23    will of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the</P>\n","<P>24    West who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or</P>\n","<P>25    execution or extermination.  There was no plan.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            When the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in</P>\n","<P> 2    many places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only</P>\n","<P> 3    where the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats</P>\n","<P> 4    were in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,</P>\n","<P> 5    not a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the</P>\n","<P> 6    majority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They</P>\n","<P> 7    had already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we</P>\n","<P> 9    have already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the</P>\n","<P>10    other places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,</P>\n","<P>11    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in</P>\n","<P>12    any kind of military activities?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in</P>\n","<P>14    January, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but</P>\n","<P>15    the UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,</P>\n","<P>16    although they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was</P>\n","<P>17    established, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be</P>\n","\n","<P>18    disarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.</P>\n","<P>19            The Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian</P>\n","<P>20    villages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there</P>\n","<P>21    were two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active</P>\n","<P>22    in the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces</P>\n","<P>23    in the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the</P>\n","<P>24    only activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica</P>\n","<P>25    area.  It was in the beginning of 1993.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            As for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,</P>\n","<P> 2    I don't know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up</P>\n","<P> 3    only in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all</P>\n","<P> 4    over Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army</P>\n","<P> 5    of the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska</P>\n","<P> 6    Krajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his</P>\n","<P> 7    volunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars</P>\n","<P> 8    there, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed</P>\n","<P>10    and what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy</P>\n","<P>11    that we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in</P>\n","<P>12    whole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and</P>\n","<P>13    Herzegovina?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and</P>\n","<P>15    there was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen</P>\n","<P>16    happened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on</P>\n","<P>17    their own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit</P>\n","<P>18    murders or anything of the kind.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war</P>\n","<P>20    in Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the</P>\n","<P>21    other participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by</P>\n","<P>22    Mr. Nice.</P>\n","<P>23            Look at paragraph 33.  We've just been discussing paragraph 32.  I</P>\n","<P>24    won't read the beginning of paragraph 33 because it's the same:  \"From on</P>\n","<P>25    or about the 1st of March, 1992,\" and so on and so forth, and then it</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    says:  \"On the territory of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa,</P>\n","<P> 2    Bosanski Novi, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Sarajevo (Ilijas), Kljuc,</P>\n","<P> 3    Kalinovik, Kotor Varos, Nevesinje, Sarajevo, Novi Grad, Sarajevo, Novo</P>\n","<P> 4    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Rudo, Sanski Most, Srebrenica</P>\n","<P> 5    again, Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\"  Please --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You are finished reading that list.  Let me</P>\n","<P> 7    remind you, Mr. Milosevic, that the Rule 98 bis decision found that there</P>\n","<P> 8    was not enough evidence to support the allegation in paragraph 32 in</P>\n","<P> 9    relation to some of the villages or municipalities mentioned.  In fact, as</P>\n","<P>10    far as paragraph 32 is concerned, you need only concern yourself with</P>\n","<P>11    Brcko, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Bijeljina, Kotor Varos, Kljuc,</P>\n","<P>12    Bosanski Novi.  And I am checking to see whether the decision affected</P>\n","<P>13    paragraph 33.</P>\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, could you please let</P>\n","<P>15    me know what evidence, as you say there was no evidence for these places,</P>\n","<P>16    but what was the evidence that Mr. Nice presented here about the other</P>\n","<P>17    places linking me --</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.  Mr. Milosevic, the Rule 98 bis</P>\n","<P>19    decision was published and was available to you.  But I bring that to your</P>\n","<P>20    attention so we don't waste time.  And I'll ask the legal officer to give</P>\n","<P>21    me the information in relation to paragraph 33.</P>\n","<P>22            Go ahead, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>23            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   As I was saying, Mr. Seselj, I read out a list here.  It's a long</P>\n","<P>25    paragraph with all the names of the towns where I, together with others,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    am charged with working for the extermination of Muslims and Croats.  You</P>\n","<P> 2    know the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that</P>\n","<P> 3    referred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded</P>\n","<P> 4    in any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted</P>\n","<P> 6    to, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A</P>\n","<P> 7    civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally</P>\n","<P> 8    wanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a</P>\n","<P> 9    constituent people.</P>\n","<P>10            And the question arises from there where are the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>11    Mostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>12    Travnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from</P>\n","<P>13    many other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats</P>\n","<P>14    during that civil war?</P>\n","<P>15            After the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the</P>\n","<P>16    population, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did</P>\n","<P>17    take place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,</P>\n","<P>18    in figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I</P>\n","<P>19    can put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes</P>\n","<P>20    crimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,</P>\n","<P>21    sometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,</P>\n","<P>22    criminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and</P>\n","<P>23    revenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes</P>\n","<P>24    did not exist.  That did not happen.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    joint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I'd like</P>\n","<P> 2    to draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of</P>\n","<P> 3    December, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33</P>\n","<P> 4    and indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns</P>\n","<P> 5    are repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns</P>\n","<P> 6    too.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.</P>\n","<P> 7            So what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during</P>\n","<P> 8    that period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of</P>\n","<P> 9    December 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring</P>\n","<P>10    Bosnia and Herzegovina?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia</P>\n","<P>12    or, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of</P>\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It</P>\n","<P>14    did not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help</P>\n","<P>15    materially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs</P>\n","<P>16    living over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different</P>\n","<P>17    political relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership</P>\n","<P>18    of Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in</P>\n","<P>19    which those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep</P>\n","<P>20    conflicts, and they didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues.</P>\n","<P>21            So throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the</P>\n","<P>22    indictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,</P>\n","<P>23    the leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered</P>\n","<P>24    in looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far</P>\n","<P>25    accepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    attacked ourselves for our part.</P>\n","<P> 2            So I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy</P>\n","<P> 3    dating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact</P>\n","<P> 4    that that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all</P>\n","<P> 5    costs.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no</P>\n","<P> 6    alternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at</P>\n","<P> 7    the price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept</P>\n","<P> 8    because they were not able to take such great concessions.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities</P>\n","<P>10    of that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these</P>\n","<P>11    towns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I</P>\n","<P>12    personally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,</P>\n","<P>13    et cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason</P>\n","<P>14    explanation?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Yes, I do, and that's explanation is the following and the fact</P>\n","<P>16    that through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,</P>\n","<P>17    and --</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not</P>\n","<P>19    an explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.</P>\n","<P>20            So please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,</P>\n","<P>23    Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac</P>\n","<P>24    again, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in</P>\n","<P>25    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with</P>\n","<P> 2    regard to that point of the indictment?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised</P>\n","<P> 4    crime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don't know whether in all the</P>\n","<P> 5    places enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took</P>\n","<P> 6    place in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each</P>\n","<P> 7    individual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the</P>\n","<P> 8    motives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are</P>\n","<P> 9    still living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can</P>\n","<P>10    be established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side</P>\n","<P>11    and the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to</P>\n","<P>12    investigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to</P>\n","<P>13    strike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the</P>\n","<P>14    number of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you've said when you said</P>\n","<P>16    that some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let's look at</P>\n","<P>17    that for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of</P>\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or</P>\n","<P>19    formations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes</P>\n","<P>20    that you know of?  Are there any links?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of</P>\n","<P>22    power and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as</P>\n","<P>23    well, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,</P>\n","<P>24    the Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the</P>\n","<P>25    Academy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    everybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out</P>\n","<P> 2    against them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for</P>\n","<P> 3    freedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were</P>\n","<P> 4    being perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes</P>\n","<P> 5    should be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind</P>\n","<P> 6    via the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political</P>\n","<P> 7    parties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which</P>\n","<P> 8    strove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors</P>\n","<P> 9    spoke out against crimes.</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>11            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Now, we -- let's look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful</P>\n","<P>13    confinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,</P>\n","<P>14    Bosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the</P>\n","<P>15    territories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,</P>\n","<P>16    Samac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,</P>\n","<P>17    Kotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,</P>\n","<P>18    Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>19            Tell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these</P>\n","<P>20    people in these towns did we take part in?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have</P>\n","<P>22    had anything to do with any such thing.</P>\n","<P>23            First of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What</P>\n","<P>24    the confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of</P>\n","<P>25    civilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    unlawful, and there were such cases.</P>\n","<P> 2            Now, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of</P>\n","<P> 3    all, there were individual instances in some of these places through the</P>\n","<P> 4    self-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance</P>\n","<P> 5    of Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.</P>\n","<P> 6    And then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of</P>\n","<P> 7    their own because they couldn't influence him.  He appeared as a factor,</P>\n","<P> 8    and there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his</P>\n","<P> 9    motives were of a criminal nature.</P>\n","<P>10            There were other such cases in some of these places whereby</P>\n","<P>11    somebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in</P>\n","<P>12    order to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive</P>\n","<P>13    money and then release them once they received money for that.  There were</P>\n","<P>14    also instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,</P>\n","<P>15    somebody's family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or</P>\n","<P>16    Croats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often</P>\n","<P>17    were not able to prevent revenge of that kind.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Which authorities?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian</P>\n","<P>21    authorities intervene?</P>\n","<P>22       A.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn't influence or involve</P>\n","<P>23    themselves in any such matters.</P>\n","<P>24            So as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one</P>\n","<P>25    should take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    those cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and</P>\n","<P> 2    what the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.</P>\n","<P> 3            Now, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places</P>\n","<P> 4    where possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of</P>\n","<P> 5    context and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse</P>\n","<P> 6    top-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian</P>\n","<P> 7    Yugoslavia as well.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has</P>\n","<P> 9    become a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you</P>\n","<P>10    say that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing</P>\n","<P>11    like the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged</P>\n","<P>12    by the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.</P>\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn't understand me correctly,</P>\n","<P>14    Mr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,</P>\n","<P>15    but there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top</P>\n","<P>16    echelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely</P>\n","<P>17    impossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like</P>\n","<P>18    that, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is</P>\n","<P>19    impossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such</P>\n","<P>20    thing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did</P>\n","<P>21    commit crimes.  And it wasn't only individuals who committed crimes.</P>\n","<P>22    There was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.</P>\n","<P>23    And I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my</P>\n","<P>24    information, but I can't be well-versed in everything, but I can in</P>\n","<P>25    basics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    wasn't the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit</P>\n","<P> 2    crimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn't the policy of the</P>\n","<P> 3    leadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.</P>\n","<P> 4            Now, --</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn't the policy of this accused in</P>\n","<P> 6    concert with other --</P>\n","<P> 7            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of</P>\n","<P> 8    Mr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,</P>\n","<P> 9    continuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such</P>\n","<P>10    crimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the</P>\n","<P>11    most serious form of war crimes.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There's an enormous</P>\n","<P>15    list of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,</P>\n","<P>16    and the subject here is deportation.</P>\n","<P>17            Now, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let's clarify that.  Albeit in</P>\n","<P>18    Serbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,</P>\n","<P>19    Muslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,</P>\n","<P>20    70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle</P>\n","<P>21    of non-discrimination like anybody else.</P>\n","<P>22            Now, I can't clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is</P>\n","<P>23    being accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it</P>\n","<P>24    stated here -- it says:  \"Milosevic, acting alone or together with other</P>\n","<P>25    members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or</P>\n","<P> 2    execution of the unlawful forcible transfer...\"</P>\n","<P> 3            Now, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic</P>\n","<P> 4    of Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or</P>\n","<P> 5    unlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful</P>\n","<P> 6    movement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one</P>\n","<P> 7    individual?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with</P>\n","<P> 9    anything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these</P>\n","<P>10    phenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what</P>\n","<P>11    did happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group</P>\n","<P>12    to leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that</P>\n","<P>13    desire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were</P>\n","<P>14    instances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,</P>\n","<P>15    that people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,</P>\n","<P>16    something afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind</P>\n","<P>17    what had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to</P>\n","<P>18    move out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or</P>\n","<P>19    perhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they</P>\n","<P>20    were the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and</P>\n","<P>21    in some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established</P>\n","<P>22    in some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete</P>\n","<P>23    example, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from</P>\n","<P>24    Prijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a</P>\n","<P>25    convoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I'm stopping you because you have</P>\n","<P> 2    answered the question.  You are becoming a little too expansive.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think that this would be very</P>\n","<P> 4    important.</P>\n","<P> 5            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what example do you know of personally?</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   I'm talking about one example when Muslims were transported</P>\n","<P> 8    because they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And</P>\n","<P> 9    then the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose</P>\n","<P>10    name is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is</P>\n","<P>11    called Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large</P>\n","<P>12    group of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the</P>\n","<P>13    authorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part</P>\n","<P>14    of Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army</P>\n","<P>15    of Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.</P>\n","<P>16            Then he tried to explain this in a completely different way:</P>\n","<P>17    Somebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he's</P>\n","<P>18    trying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.</P>\n","<P>19            Such people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,</P>\n","<P>20    entered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and</P>\n","<P>21    then they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed</P>\n","<P>22    although they are invariably false because --</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm stopping you.  Mr. Seselj, no doubt you're a</P>\n","<P>24    man of many virtues.  Is omniscience one of them?  How do you happen to</P>\n","<P>25    know all these things?  I have to ask myself that question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson --</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Where is your knowledge coming from?</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, all my life I have</P>\n","<P> 4    been learning, learning, learning, and constantly learning.  Even now in</P>\n","<P> 5    prison I read eight to ten hours a day, although the conditions under</P>\n","<P> 6    which I live are very poor because they want to prevent me from preparing</P>\n","<P> 7    my defence case properly.  But I'm a constant learner, and I wish others</P>\n","<P> 8    were too.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  It would help my appreciation of your evidence if</P>\n","<P>10    only occasionally we were told of the basis for the information that you</P>\n","<P>11    have about specific matters.</P>\n","<P>12            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of</P>\n","<P>15    Serbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and</P>\n","<P>16    that as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon</P>\n","<P>17    what do you base this statement?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I</P>\n","<P>19    base my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent</P>\n","<P>20    statements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.</P>\n","<P>21            Secondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.</P>\n","<P>22    They never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never</P>\n","<P>23    discriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the</P>\n","<P>24    authorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in</P>\n","<P>25    Bosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    and treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.</P>\n","<P> 2            So there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic</P>\n","<P> 3    whatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution</P>\n","<P> 4    of Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in</P>\n","<P> 5    Serbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal</P>\n","<P> 6    of money.  Perhaps not all of them were happy with what they got, but this</P>\n","<P> 7    involved major expenditure on the part of the state.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  But did the authorities of Serbia allow</P>\n","<P> 9    discrimination over any Muslim Croat or the member of any other ethnic</P>\n","<P>10    group in Serbia during the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   No.  Even if there were any incidents on ethnic grounds, the</P>\n","<P>12    authorities acted in accordance with the law and brought such matters to</P>\n","<P>13    trial.  They simply did not allow things like that to happen.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Please look at paragraph 42 now.  Again it says here:  \"Slobodan</P>\n","<P>15    Milosevic,\" and so on and so forth, on or about the 1st of March, 1992,</P>\n","<P>16    until 391st of December, 1995, acting alone or in concert with members of</P>\n","<P>17    the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or</P>\n","<P>18    otherwise aided and abetted the planning preparation or execution of</P>\n","<P>19    wanton destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the</P>\n","<P>20    Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations and then\" --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, too fast.  Too fast.</P>\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   So I, Mr. Seselj, according to this paragraph 42, aided and</P>\n","<P>24    abetted the planning, preparation or execution, I executed this.  It</P>\n","<P>25    wasn't that I only aided and abetted others, but I committed wanton</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the Bosnian</P>\n","<P> 2    Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations, and again all these</P>\n","<P> 3    municipalities are listed here where I committed wanton looting of</P>\n","<P> 4    property belonging to Muslims and Croats.</P>\n","<P> 5            Please tell us not only what you know about this but also on the</P>\n","<P> 6    basis of what you know what you know.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in</P>\n","<P> 8    any way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of</P>\n","<P> 9    private and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three</P>\n","<P>10    sides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything</P>\n","<P>11    under control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.</P>\n","<P>12            What happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims</P>\n","<P>13    would loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have</P>\n","<P>14    their own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar</P>\n","<P>15    way in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no</P>\n","<P>16    official authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No</P>\n","<P>17    one personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,</P>\n","<P>18    et cetera.</P>\n","<P>19            There were paramilitary formations that had looting as their</P>\n","<P>20    primary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also</P>\n","<P>21    from Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People</P>\n","<P>22    travelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize</P>\n","<P>23    their car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were</P>\n","<P>24    such cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial</P>\n","<P>25    Chamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    looting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions</P>\n","<P> 2    that were rather chaotic.</P>\n","<P> 3            There was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.</P>\n","<P> 4    Not only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika</P>\n","<P> 5    Srpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in</P>\n","<P> 7    a military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto</P>\n","<P> 8    civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and</P>\n","<P> 9    wounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.</P>\n","<P>10            You were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please</P>\n","<P>11    explain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,</P>\n","<P>12    tell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of</P>\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.</P>\n","<P>14       A.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a</P>\n","<P>15    dissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict</P>\n","<P>16    in Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of</P>\n","<P>17    the duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case</P>\n","<P>18    elsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on</P>\n","<P>19    both sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less</P>\n","<P>20    casualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what</P>\n","<P>21    Judge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I</P>\n","<P>22    read.</P>\n","<P>23            I was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the</P>\n","<P>24    killing of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted</P>\n","<P>25    intentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Muslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present</P>\n","<P> 2    this in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,</P>\n","<P> 3    Vasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not</P>\n","<P> 4    take part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official</P>\n","<P> 5    factors from Serbia, that is.</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.  On the transcript it's a double</P>\n","<P> 7    negative.</P>\n","<P> 8            Yes, Mr. --</P>\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] There is a double negative in the</P>\n","<P>10    Serbian language and it does not change the meaning of the statement.  In</P>\n","<P>11    English it might mean something different.  I'm sorry I don't know English</P>\n","<P>12    and I cannot really adjust to this.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or</P>\n","<P>15    deny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took</P>\n","<P>16    part in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you</P>\n","<P>17    confirm that?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   All right.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The</P>\n","<P>21    Muslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the</P>\n","<P>22    liberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.</P>\n","<P>23       Q.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his</P>\n","<P>24    witness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,</P>\n","<P>25    including women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only</P>\n","<P> 2    logical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee</P>\n","<P> 3    from war.  They're fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.</P>\n","<P> 4            Very often in this war and in any other war civilians would get</P>\n","<P> 5    killed by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from</P>\n","<P> 6    the conflict.</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the</P>\n","<P> 8    Serbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it's supposed</P>\n","<P> 9    to seem?</P>\n","<P>10       A.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray</P>\n","<P>11    this, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their</P>\n","<P>12    victims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We</P>\n","<P>13    are faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is</P>\n","<P>14    based and anti-Serb grounds.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings</P>\n","<P>16    happened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all</P>\n","<P>17    of that can be found here in this indictment that I've been quoting to</P>\n","<P>18    you, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.</P>\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to</P>\n","<P>20    give.  Ask another question.</P>\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a</P>\n","<P>22    question to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that</P>\n","<P>23    he can give an answer.  He's a politician, an intellectual, a university</P>\n","<P>24    professor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,</P>\n","<P>25    and he is in a position to give an answer to this question.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And I've already ruled that he is not to answer</P>\n","<P> 2    it.  So proceed.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the</P>\n","<P> 6    JNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know</P>\n","<P> 7    about that?  This is on transcript page 20408.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The</P>\n","<P> 9    two sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the</P>\n","<P>10    bridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric</P>\n","<P>11    power plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to</P>\n","<P>12    destroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old</P>\n","<P>13    hydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the</P>\n","<P>14    paramilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The</P>\n","<P>15    conflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can't say exactly, I</P>\n","<P>16    wasn't there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And</P>\n","<P>17    then also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units</P>\n","<P>19    committed crimes in Zvornik.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there</P>\n","<P>21    that can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but</P>\n","<P>22    who it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are</P>\n","<P>23    ascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to</P>\n","<P>24    Karadzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.</P>\n","<P>25            In Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    people for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing</P>\n","<P> 5    them, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They</P>\n","<P> 6    are mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided</P>\n","<P> 7    by Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,</P>\n","<P> 8    Drinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you</P>\n","<P> 9    heard anything about this and what do you know about it?</P>\n","<P>10       A.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my</P>\n","<P>11    knowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but</P>\n","<P>12    once the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very</P>\n","<P>13    simply, who the victims were and who the executors were.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the</P>\n","<P>15    cultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many</P>\n","<P>16    persons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force</P>\n","<P>17    there is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I'll just go</P>\n","<P>18    on.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were</P>\n","<P>20    committed.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn't the JNA that</P>\n","<P>21    took part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take</P>\n","<P>22    part in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully</P>\n","<P>23    investigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims</P>\n","<P>24    are still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether</P>\n","<P>25    there was enough will to investigate this matter, and I've already</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    referred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect</P>\n","<P> 2    a great deal from that.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I don't know anything about it.  I wasn't there.</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj and Mr. Milosevic, you are not</P>\n","<P> 6    observing the pause between question and answer, and you are thereby</P>\n","<P> 7    creating difficulties for the interpreter.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, this is the first time</P>\n","<P> 9    you have warned us about this today.  As you see, Mr. Seselj and I are</P>\n","<P>10    bearing this in mind.</P>\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We're practising.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment</P>\n","<P>14    in this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your</P>\n","<P>15    units.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan's men.  Do</P>\n","<P>16    you have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your</P>\n","<P>17    units were there?  You've already explained you didn't have any units of</P>\n","<P>18    yours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers</P>\n","<P>19    were there?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I'm not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik</P>\n","<P>21    area.  I know that Arkan's Tigers were active there but to what extent and</P>\n","<P>22    in what locations I couldn't say because I wasn't there.</P>\n","<P>23            All the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I</P>\n","<P>24    do not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and</P>\n","<P>25    misfortunes he talked about, but evidently he's very confused when</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    identifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He's mixing up Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 2    men, the White Eagles, Arkan's men, and this shows that he's very confused</P>\n","<P> 3    and unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers</P>\n","<P> 4    of the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to</P>\n","<P> 5    everything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very</P>\n","<P> 6    often it's beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn't be easy to</P>\n","<P> 7    establish who actually perpetrated this.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a</P>\n","<P> 9    certain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the</P>\n","<P>10    transcript.  Do you know anything about this?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>12    committed any crimes in that place.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>14    Radical Party?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party</P>\n","<P>16    sent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,</P>\n","<P>17    and as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me</P>\n","<P>18    had any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I'm sure of it.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Would other volunteers have reported this?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and</P>\n","<P>21    they would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,</P>\n","<P>22    because this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about</P>\n","<P>24    the conducts of the volunteers?</P>\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn't say the reports were</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    regular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out</P>\n","<P> 2    how the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All</P>\n","<P> 3    the problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of</P>\n","<P> 4    indiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers</P>\n","<P> 5    to be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline</P>\n","<P> 6    of the other men.</P>\n","<P> 7            I was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the</P>\n","<P> 8    conclusion that none occurred.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral</P>\n","<P>11    conversations.</P>\n","<P>12            I'm convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written</P>\n","<P>13    reports would have been sent to me.  I'm sure that the competent command</P>\n","<P>14    would have told me had something like this happened.</P>\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>16            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Mr. Seselj, if you can't recall it doesn't matter, but is it true</P>\n","<P>18    that in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,</P>\n","<P>19    1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of</P>\n","<P>20    Seselj's men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj's men, then</P>\n","<P>22    should be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell</P>\n","<P>23    you whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group</P>\n","<P>24    of Seselj's men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he's</P>\n","<P>25    the leader if they don't know his name?  What does the term \"leader\" mean?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Was he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times</P>\n","<P> 2    that volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in</P>\n","<P> 3    units larger than a company.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I</P>\n","<P> 6    have a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I</P>\n","<P> 7    wanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the</P>\n","<P> 8    indictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no</P>\n","<P> 9    such instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>10    Party.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such</P>\n","<P>14    instances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various</P>\n","<P>15    allegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of</P>\n","<P>16    time.</P>\n","<P>17            Please tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about</P>\n","<P>18    the events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men</P>\n","<P>19    participated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   First of all --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is that reference?</P>\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I quoted about half an hour ago, but</P>\n","<P>23    it wasn't sufficiently clear.  I will try to find it again.  I'm simply</P>\n","<P>24    trying to establish whether the witness knows anything about</P>\n","<P>25    Bosanski Samac.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have some knowledge but --</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  The answer -- the question I have is --  what do</P>\n","<P> 3    you mean by \"because it says,\" it says, \"that your men participated in</P>\n","<P> 4    taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\"  What is \"it\"?</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj something about</P>\n","<P> 6    Samac before, but right now I can't find it.</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  I take it it's not another reference to the</P>\n","<P> 8    indictment against Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P> 9            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I don't think it is.</P>\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have Bosanski Samac mentioned in</P>\n","<P>11    several places on your indictment, if I can be of assistance, and I can</P>\n","<P>12    tell you what I know about the events in Bosanski Samac.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   Well, that's the only reason I asked you whether you knew</P>\n","<P>15    anything.</P>\n","<P>16       A.   In paragraph 42 Bosanski Samac is ascribed to you.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Well, all the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are</P>\n","<P>18    ascribed to me.  There aren't any which are not ascribed to me.  But what</P>\n","<P>19    do you know about the events there?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I don't understand this question.  You</P>\n","<P>21    can't just ask a question, take a municipality and say, \"What do you know</P>\n","<P>22    about events there?\"  There's got to be some point to the question.</P>\n","<P>23            Now, what is this dealing with?</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Very well.  I won't ask you anything about that, then, because I</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    can't find the reference now.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, Mr. Milosevic.  If you find the</P>\n","<P> 3    reference, you can come back to it, but bear in mind that you undertook to</P>\n","<P> 4    complete the evidence in chief today.</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I'm doing my best, Mr. Robinson, but</P>\n","<P> 6    there are many, many witnesses who mentioned Mr. Seselj, and I want to see</P>\n","<P> 7    whether there's any truth in anything they said.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, you may -- Mr. Milosevic, you may have</P>\n","<P> 9    other witnesses who may be in a better position to contradict the</P>\n","<P>10    assertions in the Prosecution case than Mr. Seselj himself.  Don't assume</P>\n","<P>11    that because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he's the</P>\n","<P>12    best person to contradict it.</P>\n","<P>13            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.</P>\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   On page 23520 of the transcript.  I'll skip over the witness's</P>\n","<P>16    name because I can't recall at present whether or not he was protected,</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Robinson.  I don't think he was, because I don't have any note to that</P>\n","<P>18    effect, but he says:  \"In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the</P>\n","<P>19    White Wolves, and the JNA participated.\"</P>\n","<P>20            Do you know anything about this?</P>\n","<P>21       A.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,</P>\n","<P>22    there was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from</P>\n","<P>23    Eastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the</P>\n","<P>24    indictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.</P>\n","<P>25    His name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    helicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was</P>\n","<P> 2    accompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 3    Party, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for</P>\n","<P> 4    sure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also</P>\n","<P> 5    Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as</P>\n","<P> 6    the Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was</P>\n","<P> 7    charged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in</P>\n","<P> 8    Banja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 9    Party.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and</P>\n","<P>10    the party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don't know that Kragujevac</P>\n","<P>12    is not in Bosnia.</P>\n","<P>13       A.   That's correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I'm getting ready</P>\n","<P>14    to obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was</P>\n","<P>15    expelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan</P>\n","<P>16    Savic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the</P>\n","<P>17    Serb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave</P>\n","<P>18    my legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial</P>\n","<P>19    and all the accompanying materials.</P>\n","<P>20            As for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to</P>\n","<P>21    me certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man</P>\n","<P>22    Radovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his</P>\n","<P>23    participation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.</P>\n","<P>24            Those are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members</P>\n","<P>25    of the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    had previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even</P>\n","<P> 2    called him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was</P>\n","<P> 3    Srecko Radovanovic.</P>\n","<P> 4            There was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was</P>\n","<P> 5    certainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was</P>\n","<P> 6    certainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been</P>\n","<P> 7    he would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that</P>\n","<P> 8    unit was called the Grey Wolves.</P>\n","<P> 9            JUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I've understood</P>\n","<P>10    from that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions</P>\n","<P>11    in Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you've said?</P>\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,</P>\n","<P>13    yes.</P>\n","<P>14            JUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called</P>\n","<P>15    the Grey Wolves active there?</P>\n","<P>16            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it's very problematic to say</P>\n","<P>17    paramilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means</P>\n","<P>18    outside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial</P>\n","<P>19    Defence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I'm not</P>\n","<P>20    sure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,</P>\n","<P>21    I think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good</P>\n","<P>22    fighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what</P>\n","<P>23    happened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called</P>\n","<P>24    Crkvina or something like that.  I can't recall it all off the top of my</P>\n","<P>25    head, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Banja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven't dealt with.  Did</P>\n","<P> 3    they participate?</P>\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What</P>\n","<P> 5    Red Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's a perfectly legitimate answer for you to</P>\n","<P> 7    give, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the</P>\n","<P> 8    Red Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the</P>\n","<P> 9    quotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,</P>\n","<P>10    which on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they've got</P>\n","<P>11    nothing to do with the question.  So all I'm doing now is trying to find</P>\n","<P>12    out what the real answer to that question is.</P>\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.</P>\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the</P>\n","<P>15    Red Berets.</P>\n","<P>16                          --- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.</P>\n","<P>17                          --- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.</P>\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the</P>\n","<P>19    technical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary</P>\n","<P>20    resulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected</P>\n","<P>21    witness.</P>\n","<P>22            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>23            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Wolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also</P>\n","<P> 2    mentioned.  Now, the witness, I don't know whether he was protected or</P>\n","<P> 3    not, I don't want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript says that he saw 20 locals, and it's about Samac, wearing</P>\n","<P> 5    uniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed</P>\n","<P> 6    they were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned</P>\n","<P> 7    to Samac.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, I don't have any information to that effect, and that is</P>\n","<P> 9    quite impossible.  I'd like to point out once again that in different</P>\n","<P>10    places they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had</P>\n","<P>11    found some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have</P>\n","<P>12    been various units, especially as we're talking about locals in this</P>\n","<P>13    particular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What</P>\n","<P>14    does it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some</P>\n","<P>15    warehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they</P>\n","<P>16    were some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the</P>\n","<P>17    Red Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of</P>\n","<P>18    the State Security in 1996.</P>\n","<P>19            So quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term</P>\n","<P>20    applies to different concepts.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I</P>\n","<P>22    think that is in the indictment against you but you'll put me right if I'm</P>\n","<P>23    wrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,</P>\n","<P>24    that is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,</P>\n","<P>25    wherein amongst others you said:  \"Dear brother Chetniks, especially you</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    across the Drina, you're the bravest, and we're going to clear up Bosnia</P>\n","<P> 2    from the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong.\"  Is</P>\n","<P> 3    it true that you said that?</P>\n","<P> 4       A.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and</P>\n","<P> 5    partially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,</P>\n","<P> 6    because -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don't always know</P>\n","<P> 7    the Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an</P>\n","<P> 8    artificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the</P>\n","<P> 9    Croats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian</P>\n","<P>10    variation \"pogan\" means \"pagan,\" where as in the Serb language \"pogan\"</P>\n","<P>11    means \"waste\" or \"faeces.\"  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and</P>\n","<P>12    pan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called</P>\n","<P>13    them \"pogani,\" which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the</P>\n","<P>14    Muslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I'm not a stupid</P>\n","<P>15    man.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have</P>\n","<P>16    nothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more</P>\n","<P>17    than I do to all the Christians afterwards, let's make that point clear,</P>\n","<P>18    but I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --</P>\n","<P>19    greatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims</P>\n","<P>20    to be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.</P>\n","<P>21            So here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion</P>\n","<P>22    is being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,</P>\n","<P>23    and I've been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,</P>\n","<P>24    Islamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they</P>\n","<P>25    first appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?</P>\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.  Well, if you</P>\n","<P> 4    haven't got if it in my books then the Prosecution probably has a copy</P>\n","<P> 5    because most of my speeches were published in my books, in my works so, if</P>\n","<P> 6    a speech does not happen to be there, if --</P>\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  Was this one published in your books?  I apologise.</P>\n","<P> 8    I haven't read them all.</P>\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson [sic], two years ago I</P>\n","<P>10    handed over to The Hague Tribunal 80 of my printed works.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  Is this speech in any of them?</P>\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Most probably, but it would be up to</P>\n","<P>13    the Prosecution to find it, not me.  I can't look through that whole</P>\n","<P>14    matter myself, because I didn't make the statement only in one place.  I</P>\n","<P>15    made the statement in several places, on several occasions.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  Well, normally the party presenting the evidence is</P>\n","<P>17    responsible for getting it to court in some -- as official as is possible,</P>\n","<P>18    but you're not aware of a copy of it being available for us as part of the</P>\n","<P>19    papers in connection with your evidence.</P>\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Bonomy, the side that has</P>\n","<P>21    referred to my alleged speech is the Prosecution's side.  So I'm just</P>\n","<P>22    telling you where they made a mistake.  So they can find the original of</P>\n","<P>23    the speech and present it here.  I can't do the work of the Prosecution.</P>\n","<P>24    I can't be expected to do that.  I am testifying to the facts and</P>\n","<P>25    circumstances about which I have knowledge.  I'm not here to help the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Prosecution out in its work.  And for my part, I have contributed</P>\n","<P> 2    sufficiently by handing over all my books.  They have far greater</P>\n","<P> 3    resources than I do.</P>\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Nice, can you help?  Where do I locate the</P>\n","<P> 5    evidence, readily locate the evidence in relation to this?</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. NICE:  I'm not sure you can locate it readily at the moment</P>\n","<P> 7    from our own database.  It may be possible.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  It appears Mr. Seselj is suggesting that there is</P>\n","<P> 9    evidence of this speech led by the Prosecution in this case.</P>\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  It may be in this case or it may be in the pre-trial</P>\n","<P>11    brief of his own case.  I'll deal with it as soon as I can.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  All right.  Thank you.</P>\n","<P>13            MR. NICE:  We can't of course be guided in the way we are going to</P>\n","<P>14    present our questions through his observations.  We'll make our own</P>\n","<P>15    decisions.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  No, no, no.  That's nothing to the point.  I'm just</P>\n","<P>17    trying to clarify where I can read this speech, but if no one's going to</P>\n","<P>18    help me, that's okay.</P>\n","<P>19            MR. NICE:  We certainly will help you when we can.</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Witness B1643 who testified pursuant to 92 bis, I assume you know</P>\n","<P>23    the written part, mentioned torture and capture of civilians in the SUP</P>\n","<P>24    building of the Territorial Defence in the primary school and secondary</P>\n","<P>25    school in Crkvina, the warehouse there.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, I already mentioned something about this.  I said that the</P>\n","<P> 2    Crkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey</P>\n","<P> 3    Wolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was</P>\n","<P> 4    arrested, but I don't have any details about how the trial proceeded and</P>\n","<P> 5    the upshot.  I asked my legal advisors to find the complete dossier of</P>\n","<P> 6    that trial, but I do know for certain that he was arrested and taken to</P>\n","<P> 7    trial in Banja Luka, prosecuted in Banja Luka.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   The indictment against you, in the indictment you are accused of</P>\n","<P> 9    an act on the 7th of May, 1992, which allegedly happened there which says</P>\n","<P>10    that two leaders of your group under your command killed 18 males at the</P>\n","<P>11    agricultural farm in Crkvina.  Is that the event you are referring to?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn't there</P>\n","<P>13    nor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical</P>\n","<P>14    Party.</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   That's all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your</P>\n","<P>16    answer suffices.</P>\n","<P>17            You are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when</P>\n","<P>18    allegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated</P>\n","<P>19    killed 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating</P>\n","<P>21    on the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?</P>\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was</P>\n","<P>23    quoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.</P>\n","<P>24    So it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this</P>\n","<P>25    question of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    concept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he</P>\n","<P> 2    stands accused, because he's testifying here.</P>\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily</P>\n","<P> 4    relevant for that purpose.</P>\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I'm not going to</P>\n","<P> 6    insist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.</P>\n","<P> 7            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993</P>\n","<P> 9    some members of your alleged --</P>\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have</P>\n","<P>11    continued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not</P>\n","<P>12    see at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial</P>\n","<P>13    here.  I know that he's alleged to be a member of the joint criminal</P>\n","<P>14    enterprise.  I'm well aware of that.  But that doesn't let in any and all</P>\n","<P>15    kind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.</P>\n","<P>16            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see</P>\n","<P>17    here that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,</P>\n","<P>18    then that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren't true</P>\n","<P>19    either, and he has refuted a number of witnesses' statements here that I</P>\n","<P>20    quoted.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know</P>\n","<P>22    you know that.</P>\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, witness William Thomas Francis Roy on page 28882 of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the transcript stated here that the Muslim snipers killed three pregnant</P>\n","<P> 2    women and only then did the Serb snipers respond by opening fire.  Do you</P>\n","<P> 3    know anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked</P>\n","<P> 4    to killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire</P>\n","<P> 6    in Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front</P>\n","<P> 7    line stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part</P>\n","<P> 8    under Muslim control and another part under Serb control.</P>\n","<P> 9            Now, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind</P>\n","<P>10    the following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from</P>\n","<P>11    rifles which wasn't a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because</P>\n","<P>12    sniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with</P>\n","<P>13    optic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the</P>\n","<P>14    Serb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to</P>\n","<P>15    come by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black</P>\n","<P>16    market.  I don't exclude the possibility of individual cases there being</P>\n","<P>17    the need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was</P>\n","<P>18    opened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain</P>\n","<P>19    control of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two</P>\n","<P>20    sides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn't</P>\n","<P>21    change for many years, and one or the other side would take control of</P>\n","<P>22    certain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.</P>\n","<P>23            On the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional</P>\n","<P>24    killing of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims</P>\n","<P>25    killed about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    in Kazani and so on.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the</P>\n","<P> 3    Sarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present</P>\n","<P> 4    on both sides.  Is that true?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in</P>\n","<P> 6    Sarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The</P>\n","<P> 7    real snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far</P>\n","<P> 8    more than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more</P>\n","<P> 9    sophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more</P>\n","<P>10    favourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I've forgotten the evidence which I</P>\n","<P>12    think there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How</P>\n","<P>13    much personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the</P>\n","<P>14    conflict there.</P>\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to</P>\n","<P>16    the Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that</P>\n","<P>17    is.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.</P>\n","<P>18    At Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and</P>\n","<P>19    I met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh</P>\n","<P>20    shipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my</P>\n","<P>21    colleagues from university and also people whom I'd been to school with,</P>\n","<P>22    Muslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire</P>\n","<P>24    going on?</P>\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    stay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some</P>\n","<P> 2    dangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you</P>\n","<P> 3    had to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but</P>\n","<P> 4    there were no more serious conflicts at that time.</P>\n","<P> 5            JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.</P>\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,</P>\n","<P> 8    referred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on</P>\n","<P> 9    page 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs</P>\n","<P>10    fired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in</P>\n","<P>11    Sarajevo?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open</P>\n","<P>13    fire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be</P>\n","<P>14    ascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused</P>\n","<P>15    protected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction</P>\n","<P>16    from the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo</P>\n","<P>17    they would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at</P>\n","<P>18    Serb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off</P>\n","<P>19    in the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,</P>\n","<P>20    then they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at</P>\n","<P>21    hospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,</P>\n","<P>22    who were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the</P>\n","<P>23    hospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw</P>\n","<P>24    quickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived</P>\n","<P>25    they didn't come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    fire in retaliation.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited</P>\n","<P> 3    Bijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --</P>\n","<P> 4    page 8258 of Alija Gusalic's -- 18258, and I link this up with your</P>\n","<P> 5    indictment and Alija Gusalic's testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina</P>\n","<P> 6    and members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to</P>\n","<P> 7    takeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite</P>\n","<P> 9    correct.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just</P>\n","<P>10    nonsense.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there</P>\n","<P>12    were Arkan's men and Seselj's men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything</P>\n","<P>13    about that?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb</P>\n","<P>15    Radical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I'm absolutely certain</P>\n","<P>16    of that.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   The same witness says on page 18260, \"Seselj's men had beards and</P>\n","<P>18    cockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to</P>\n","<P>19    distribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party.\"</P>\n","<P>20       A.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>21    Radical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly</P>\n","<P>22    clean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not</P>\n","<P>23    bring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot</P>\n","<P>24    be synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for</P>\n","<P>25    ideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    not a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier</P>\n","<P> 2    having a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not</P>\n","<P> 3    distribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role</P>\n","<P> 4    in these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.</P>\n","<P> 5            Members of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but</P>\n","<P> 6    exclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.</P>\n","<P> 7       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now</P>\n","<P> 8    I'm asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were</P>\n","<P> 9    not Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were</P>\n","<P>10    held at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you</P>\n","<P>11    know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>12       A.   I don't know about those particular localities, but I've already</P>\n","<P>13    talked about Mauzer's and Arkan's conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for</P>\n","<P>14    that reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often</P>\n","<P>15    attacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.</P>\n","<P>16       Q.   I'm sorry that I didn't draw your attention to this on time,</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you</P>\n","<P>18    are being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in</P>\n","<P>19    Batkovic.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   I've already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb</P>\n","<P>21    Radical Party there.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.</P>\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic</P>\n","<P>24    testified here, and he made those assertions here, and I'm linking that up</P>\n","<P>25    with --</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness</P>\n","<P> 2    made the allegations here.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp</P>\n","<P> 4    near Bijeljina.  And I've linked that up to what the indictment against</P>\n","<P> 5    Mr. Seselj says.</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that's not relevant.  Move on.</P>\n","<P> 7            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.</P>\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused</P>\n","<P> 9    Mr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a</P>\n","<P>10    hundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?</P>\n","<P>11            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it's not relevant to</P>\n","<P>13    this case.</P>\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the</P>\n","<P>15    basis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks</P>\n","<P>16    about Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in</P>\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj's indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane</P>\n","<P>18    treatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in</P>\n","<P>19    Seselj's indictment?</P>\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the</P>\n","<P>23    International Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything</P>\n","<P>24    about this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?</P>\n","<P>25       A.   I don't know anything about the visit of the International Red</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Cross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.</P>\n","<P> 2    Also, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of</P>\n","<P> 3    prisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not</P>\n","<P> 4    take part in any such thing.</P>\n","<P> 5            As for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and</P>\n","<P> 6    if there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would</P>\n","<P> 7    have to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right.  I'm not going to ask you about this anymore.  You</P>\n","<P> 9    mentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is</P>\n","<P>10    that right?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the</P>\n","<P>13    activity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the</P>\n","<P>14    situation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,</P>\n","<P>15    do you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no</P>\n","<P>17    paramilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in</P>\n","<P>18    Mostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,</P>\n","<P>19    from the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P>20    Party were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them</P>\n","<P>21    as highly disciplined on Belgrade television.</P>\n","<P>22            If there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have</P>\n","<P>23    been members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention</P>\n","<P>24    platoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not</P>\n","<P>25    preclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    was not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp</P>\n","<P> 3    there were Seselj's Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;</P>\n","<P> 4    transcript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   That is absolutely impossible.  I've never heard of the White</P>\n","<P> 6    Eagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven't heard of this Buna</P>\n","<P> 7    camp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical</P>\n","<P> 8    Party, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared</P>\n","<P> 9    in Buna.  I don't know anything about this, but there should be proper</P>\n","<P>10    records to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White</P>\n","<P>11    Eagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any</P>\n","<P>12    Red Berets.</P>\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in</P>\n","<P>14    Nevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I</P>\n","<P>16    was in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and</P>\n","<P>17    in the Neretva valley.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in</P>\n","<P>20    Nevesinje.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   That will do.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable</P>\n","<P>23    number of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no</P>\n","<P>24    conflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large</P>\n","<P>25    number of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    were put up at various facilities there.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Do you know anything about a lake, Boracko Jezero, and a rest</P>\n","<P> 3    house there where about 19 persons were killed, according to the</P>\n","<P> 4    allegations made?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers</P>\n","<P> 6    of the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That's close to</P>\n","<P> 7    Konjic.  I've already said that there were members of the Serb guard</P>\n","<P> 8    there.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was</P>\n","<P> 9    there, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was</P>\n","<P>10    operating.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan's Serb</P>\n","<P>12    volunteer guard?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared</P>\n","<P>16    elsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities</P>\n","<P>17    had a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because</P>\n","<P>18    they stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then</P>\n","<P>19    they appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a</P>\n","<P>20    lot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic's.  As far as I</P>\n","<P>21    know, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.</P>\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj --</P>\n","<P>23       A.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav</P>\n","<P>24    Lajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   The Serb guard.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   Of Vuk Draskovic?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from</P>\n","<P> 4    Novi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made</P>\n","<P> 6    to the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.  I've forgotten</P>\n","<P> 7    his first name.</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   Jovan.</P>\n","<P> 9       Q.   Jovan Dulovic who testified here.  Mr. Robinson instructed me to</P>\n","<P>10    find the original documents that can be linked up to your submissions</P>\n","<P>11    since they refused to admit your submissions.</P>\n","<P>12            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I am sorry, Mr. Robinson.  If you're</P>\n","<P>13    telling me to have copies made I will do that, but I've just received</P>\n","<P>14    these copies.  This is a series of photocopies of articles written by</P>\n","<P>15    Jovan Dulovic and published in Ekspres Politika from the 16th of November,</P>\n","<P>16    the 26th of November, all of that in 1991.  Then the 18th of November, the</P>\n","<P>17    2nd of November.  So from November 1991.</P>\n","<P>18            In these articles, he speaks very favourably of the JNA and</P>\n","<P>19    commends their behaviour in the fighting around Vukovar.  For example, he</P>\n","<P>20    says that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats, saw the light of</P>\n","<P>21    the day after having stayed in cellars for many --</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, what is the question?</P>\n","<P>23            MR. NICE:  And, Your Honour, if I may interrupt, if there's going</P>\n","<P>24    to be a reference to and quotation from a newspaper article, it has to be</P>\n","<P>25    on the overhead projector.  It then has to be available to us to read it</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    in full should we wish to.</P>\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's -- that's the practice, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.</P>\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, since I have only one copy of these articles and I've</P>\n","<P> 6    just received that, could the usher please place them on the ELMO, and</P>\n","<P> 7    then you can have a look at least at some of the parts that have been</P>\n","<P> 8    marked.  Reference is made to Major Sljivancanin here, too, in a very</P>\n","<P> 9    favourable light.  Gratitude for assistance to civilians, Croats, at that,</P>\n","<P>10    and so on and so forth.  Please look at this series of articles.</P>\n","<P>11            In order to answer my question, are these at least partly articles</P>\n","<P>12    that you relied on when you wrote those submissions to the other side</P>\n","<P>13    about the untruthful testimony of Jovan Dulovic or, rather, the difference</P>\n","<P>14    in -- between his reporting then and his testimony here about Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>15            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, that was a leading but nevertheless it's</P>\n","<P>16    interesting to see what the articles actually say.  And if it becomes</P>\n","<P>17    relevant to consider their admissibility as evidence, I know the Chamber</P>\n","<P>18    will have in mind its open recent ruling in respect of the documents of</P>\n","<P>19    Jasovic and the potential evidential value or not as evidence of these</P>\n","<P>20    documents, but I'm most interested frankly in seeing what they actually</P>\n","<P>21    say.</P>\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let's get it on the overhead projector.</P>\n","<P>23            There appears to be a technical problem.  We're not seeing</P>\n","<P>24    anything.</P>\n","<P>25            Mr. Milosevic, the technician is being called.  He's coming in.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    So move on to another question.  We'll come back to this.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am sorry, but my</P>\n","<P> 3    next question also has to do with something that Mr. Seselj already</P>\n","<P> 4    testified about and the document that I obtained in the meantime and that</P>\n","<P> 5    would also have to be placed on the ELMO.  That is --</P>\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,</P>\n","<P> 7    because the overhead projector is not working.</P>\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further</P>\n","<P> 9    questions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except</P>\n","<P>10    for this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a</P>\n","<P>11    decision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were</P>\n","<P>12    presented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal</P>\n","<P>13    government said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was</P>\n","<P>14    known who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.</P>\n","<P>15    The 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.  So it is about</P>\n","<P>16    40 days after the coup d'etat of the 5th of October, 2000.  It was then</P>\n","<P>17    that they were all released, set free.</P>\n","<P>18            So wanted to show you this document, and I wanted to hand out</P>\n","<P>19    copies to you.  I've just received this.  They are all in the Serbian</P>\n","<P>20    language but they can be placed on the ELMO to show what the government</P>\n","<P>21    spokesman had said was completely disregarded, and these persons mentioned</P>\n","<P>22    in the criminal report against Erdemovic were set free.</P>\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The ELMO is working now, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please take a look at this.  This is a series of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    articles from Ekspres Politika.  Can you see the date of the newspaper?</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of</P>\n","<P> 3    November.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   1991; right?</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   1991.</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   Unless this is a leading question.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   It's illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one</P>\n","<P> 8    of the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when</P>\n","<P> 9    preparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.</P>\n","<P>10    That is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of</P>\n","<P>11    Evidence and Procedure.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the</P>\n","<P>13    subheading?</P>\n","<P>14       A.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both</P>\n","<P>15    Serbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars</P>\n","<P>16    for a long time.  \"Light finally,\" is the heading.  And then in the</P>\n","<P>17    subheading:  \"Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas.\"  And then there's</P>\n","<P>18    another bit saying, \"In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,\"</P>\n","<P>19    and then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, \"I cannot believe</P>\n","<P>20    that we are alive,\" and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated</P>\n","<P>21    the town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.</P>\n","<P>22            THE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of</P>\n","<P>23    the question was not heard by the interpreters.</P>\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.  The interpreters have</P>\n","<P>25    indicated that you're overlapping and so she did not hear the beginning of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the last question.  Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P> 2            And please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.</P>\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.</P>\n","<P> 5    Perhaps it's easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text</P>\n","<P> 6    is.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as</P>\n","<P> 8    follows:  \"A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total</P>\n","<P> 9    of 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity.\"</P>\n","<P>10    That's what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and</P>\n","<P>11    Croats equally.  Civilians, that is.</P>\n","<P>12            I can't read the first paragraph because it's quite illegible, but</P>\n","<P>13    it seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,</P>\n","<P>14    that several ambulances were waiting to help.  \"It would not be a good</P>\n","<P>15    thing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now.\"</P>\n","<P>16            So Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of</P>\n","<P>17    Vukovar before the fighting had stopped.</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Can you see the subtitle which says \"The cruel major\"?</P>\n","<P>19       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this</P>\n","<P>21    refers to and what it says about this cruel major.</P>\n","<P>22       A.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians</P>\n","<P>23    very nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that</P>\n","<P>24    surprised this Croat woman, and he says:  \"No knows what she as a Croat</P>\n","<P>25    heard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers.\"  So he's describing the</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    behaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what</P>\n","<P> 2    Croatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very</P>\n","<P> 3    bad way.</P>\n","<P> 4            And then Major Sljivancanin says:  \"Whenever you need anything,</P>\n","<P> 5    look for me and I'll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to</P>\n","<P> 6    go, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full</P>\n","<P> 7    of gratitude.\"  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  \"He had</P>\n","<P> 8    followed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude.\"</P>\n","<P> 9            All this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now</P>\n","<P>10    Colonel Veselin Sljivancanin.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic</P>\n","<P>12    describes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, \"Take this</P>\n","<P>13    child to hospital immediately.\"</P>\n","<P>14       A.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, \"Take this child to the</P>\n","<P>15    hospital in Negoslavci right away,\" Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing</P>\n","<P>16    the ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  \"Let her be given</P>\n","<P>17    assistance and medicine.\"</P>\n","<P>18            A little later Vlatka's mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for</P>\n","<P>19    her daughter in the crowd.  \"Where is my child?  What have they done to</P>\n","<P>20    her?  Where have they taken her,\" Verica was crying out.</P>\n","<P>21            \"Don't be afraid.  She is in hospital,\" Sljivancanin said.  The</P>\n","<P>22    frightened woman didn't believe it.\"  This is followed by Dulovic's</P>\n","<P>23    comment:  \"Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA</P>\n","<P>24    soldiers.\"</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   And what does it say then?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   \"Get into my car.  I'll take you to the hospital so you can see</P>\n","<P> 2    your child and reassure yourself that everything is all right.  They both</P>\n","<P> 3    entered the vehicle.  In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and</P>\n","<P> 4    dressed Vlatka's wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the</P>\n","<P> 5    daughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them.\"</P>\n","<P> 6       Q.   So this is Dulovic's report from the Vukovar war theatre.</P>\n","<P> 7       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on</P>\n","<P> 9    the following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points</P>\n","<P>10    are.  This large title, this heading, that is.</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.  Now it's been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a</P>\n","<P>12    statement, \"I believed in the army.\"  And what's in the subtitle.  \"A</P>\n","<P>13    little less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in</P>\n","<P>14    Vukovar.\"  And then there's a quotation.</P>\n","<P>15       A.   \"We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the</P>\n","<P>16    guards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the</P>\n","<P>17    hospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims.\"</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   And look what it says in the article.</P>\n","<P>19       A.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the</P>\n","<P>20    following:  \"In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and</P>\n","<P>21    barricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house</P>\n","<P>22    number 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,</P>\n","<P>23    Milos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.  A few days</P>\n","<P>24    later, the members of the guards burst into the cellar.  These were</P>\n","<P>25    members of the Croatian National Guard Corps.  Get out or we'll throw a</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    bomb in.  The Chetniks are coming.  They're cutting everyone's throats.</P>\n","<P> 2    We're taking you to a shelter.\"</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   It's quite illegible.  Could you put some light on it?</P>\n","<P> 4            Look at the passages marked in yellow.  You don't have to read it</P>\n","<P> 5    all out, just a few passages.</P>\n","<P> 6       A.    \"Several of us -- or, rather, above us on the cemetery the guards</P>\n","<P> 7    members were stationed.  Milka Vidovic said, 'When they visited us in the</P>\n","<P> 8    cellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone's throats.  We</P>\n","<P> 9    Serbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the</P>\n","<P>10    only thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.  I</P>\n","<P>11    believed in our army and I believed they would arrive.'\"</P>\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  What's the question in relation to this,</P>\n","<P>13    Mr. Milosevic?</P>\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what is the signature marked in yellow here?</P>\n","<P>16       A.   Jovan Dulovic.  The same Jovan Dulovic who four or five years</P>\n","<P>17    later changed his version by -- he turned around by 180 degrees because he</P>\n","<P>18    has become a mercenary of the Western intelligence services, and he writes</P>\n","<P>19    for the magazine Vreme which is the Belgrade branch of Western</P>\n","<P>20    intelligence agencies.</P>\n","<P>21       Q.   Mr. Seselj, when you glanced through this article and you dealt</P>\n","<P>22    with it in your submission, is there a single word here which does not</P>\n","<P>23    speak favourably of the JNA and the people who fought in Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   No.  The texts are all exceptionally favourable, full of praise</P>\n","<P>25    for the soldiers and officers of the JNA during the fighting for Vukovar.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Would you look at the next page, please.  Let's just see what the</P>\n","<P> 2    date is.</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   The 18th, I suppose.  The 18th of November.</P>\n","<P> 4       Q.   Well, move on.  Move on.</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   Mr. Milosevic, Dulovic says here one day with volunteers and tank</P>\n","<P> 6    crews in the street fighting for the liberation of Vukovar.  He praises</P>\n","<P> 7    the volunteers who participated in the fighting for Vukovar as part of the</P>\n","<P> 8    JNA.  So this should be noted.</P>\n","<P> 9            Next page, please.  I think that it's very important to point this</P>\n","<P>10    out.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   And the signature is Jovan Dulovic.  What's the title of this</P>\n","<P>12    article?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   The title of this article is \"The Knights of Vukovar.\"</P>\n","<P>14       Q.   And who does it refer to?</P>\n","<P>15       A.   The units of Major Borivoje Tesic on the front line in Vukovar.</P>\n","<P>16    Major Borivoje Tesic I think -- says: \"I think this is the last stage of</P>\n","<P>17    the fighting.  Crews carrying out their tasks successfully and the help of</P>\n","<P>18    brave people is indispensable.\"  It speaks of Croatian Ustasha and so on.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic</P>\n","<P>22    said volunteers as part of JNA.  Could you show us the passage where</P>\n","<P>23    Mr. Dulovic said so?</P>\n","<P>24            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He says here:  \"One day with</P>\n","<P>25    volunteers and tank crews in the street fighting for the liberation of</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Vukovar.\"  This is above the headline.</P>\n","<P> 2            Then he goes on to say:  \"Speaking favourably of Stanko Vujanovic,</P>\n","<P> 3    he says the commander of the 1st Company of the Territorial Defence of</P>\n","<P> 4    Vukovar who is said to be a man who knows no fear.\" It's quite difficult</P>\n","<P> 5    to read this.

Can it be enlarged?</P>\n","<P> 8       A.   \"With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making</P>\n","<P> 9    openings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze</P>\n","<P>10    through and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.

Or was it your</P>\n","<P>16    comment?</P>\n","<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  Please.  In the entire text the</P>\n","<P>18    volunteers are spoken of as members of the JNA.  We have passage here in</P>\n","<P>19    the third column where it says it's in the late afternoon and the fighting</P>\n","<P>20    is dying down.  The volunteers --</P>\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Could you use the pointer.  And you indicate on the</P>\n","<P>22    newspaper on the ELMO, not your monitor.  Yes.</P>\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] \"It's late in the afternoon and the</P>\n","<P>24    fighting is dying down.  The volunteers have pierced deep, and they have</P>\n","<P>25    conquered territory between the enemy forces.  The fighters will stay here</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    until the morning.  There were no casualties today except for one soldier</P>\n","<P> 2    who was killed, and his name was Vignjevic.\"</P>\n","<P> 3            He then says:  \"We are going back while shells are flying over our</P>\n","<P> 4    heads and Howitzer shells and so on.\"</P>\n","<P> 5            This whole text implies that the volunteers why part of the JNA.</P>\n","<P> 6    Mr. Kwon, you have here an order showing that these volunteers joined the</P>\n","<P> 7    1st Guards Brigade.  The order was delivered to the OTP from Belgrade and</P>\n","<P> 8    it's beyond dispute.</P>\n","<P> 9            In the Vukovar, there were no troops outside the JNA.  There were</P>\n","<P>10    no paramilitary units.</P>\n","<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  It is your comment.  I really didn't see any</P>\n","<P>12    concrete -- the description these volunteers as part of JNA by</P>\n","<P>13    Mr. Dulovic.</P>\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have to read the whole text and</P>\n","<P>15    everything will become clear to you.</P>\n","<P>16            JUDGE KWON:  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.</P>\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]</P>\n","<P>18       Q.   Look at the next page, please.  The following text or this one</P>\n","<P>19    again says the Knights of Vukovar, Major Borivoje Tesic's units on the</P>\n","<P>20    front line, and this is a large article which seems not to be by Dulovic,</P>\n","<P>21    but on the left-hand side there is a small one:  \"Brave commander falls,</P>\n","<P>22    Borovo Selo.\"  Would you look at the signature?  I believe it's by</P>\n","<P>23    Dulovic.  Could you scroll up?</P>\n","<P>24       A.   Yes.</P>\n","<P>25       Q.   What does it say in the passage marked by yellow?</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   The initials \"JD\" mean Jovan Dulovic.</P>\n","<P> 2       Q.   And what does it say in this last passage?</P>\n","<P> 3       A.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- \"The inhabitants of the</P>\n","<P> 4    Crepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,</P>\n","<P> 5    who with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village</P>\n","<P> 6    and one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the</P>\n","<P> 7    highest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages.\"</P>\n","<P> 8       Q.   And he was killed?</P>\n","<P> 9       A.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives</P>\n","<P>10    him.  Next page.</P>\n","<P>11       Q.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a</P>\n","<P>12    look?  I haven't had time to look at it all carefully.</P>\n","<P>13       A.   Yes.  There's a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of</P>\n","<P>14    November.  \"Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate</P>\n","<P>15    Vukovar.\"</P>\n","<P>16            In these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate</P>\n","<P>17    Vukovar, and five years later he's saying something completely different.</P>\n","<P>18             \"Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in</P>\n","<P>19    Vukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb.\"  And then it</P>\n","<P>20    says:  \"The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back,\" and so on</P>\n","<P>21    and so forth.</P>\n","<P>22            So this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the</P>\n","<P>23    JNA.</P>\n","<P>24       Q.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It's been circled.</P>\n","<P>25       A.   Yes.</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Very well.</P>\n","<P> 2       A.   The 4th of November, 1991.  \"For two days fierce fighting has not</P>\n","<P> 3    stopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in</P>\n","<P> 4    flames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of</P>\n","<P> 5    Njusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the</P>\n","<P> 6    Territorial Defence.  Advances by Territorial Defence units and volunteers</P>\n","<P> 7    from the direction of Trpinja stopped on the edge of Borovo Naselje.\"</P>\n","<P> 8            He then speaks of a Croatian mortar attack on Bobota [phoen] and</P>\n","<P> 9    so on.</P>\n","<P>10       Q.   Is this another report by Dulovic?</P>\n","<P>11       A.   Yes, it's signed by Jovan Dulovic.</P>\n","<P>12       Q.   Is there anything else, any other report?</P>\n","<P>13       A.   I'm looking at another text here but I can't see whether it's by</P>\n","<P>14    Dulovic or not because it's not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian</P>\n","<P>15    volunteer guard but again a very favourable text.  I couldn't see -- I</P>\n","<P>16    can't see the name of the author here.  I can't see it on this page.</P>\n","<P>17       Q.   Is there anything else underneath, another report?</P>\n","<P>18       A.   \"Who are the volunteers,\" is the next title.</P>\n","<P>19       Q.   Well, I can't see anything anymore.</P>\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced</P>\n","<P>21    through the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is \"Through the holes</P>\n","<P>22    to the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?</P>\n","<P>23    Unknown ammunition with inhumane bullets.\"</P>\n","<P>24            What happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used</P>\n","<P>25    weapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    because the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal</P>\n","<P> 2    organs.</P>\n","<P> 3       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I can't see what it says here in yellow, highlighted</P>\n","<P> 4    in yellow.</P>\n","<P> 5       A.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It's Major Radic now</P>\n","<P> 6    who also stands accused in The Hague.  \"Throughout the month of October,</P>\n","<P> 7    the fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in</P>\n","<P> 8    the clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least</P>\n","<P> 9    one person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja</P>\n","<P>10    [phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in</P>\n","<P>11    that way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had</P>\n","<P>12    taken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.</P>\n","<P>13    The snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own</P>\n","<P>14    control and then a solution was found to move through the houses.\"</P>\n","<P>15       Q.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic's article</P>\n","<P>16    again?</P>\n","<P>17       A.   Well, it's not legible but it is a series of articles by him.  We</P>\n","<P>18    can't find a signature here but quite obviously it is a series of articles</P>\n","<P>19    by him.</P>\n","<P>20       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  Is that a series of articles to which you</P>\n","<P>21    referred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect</P>\n","<P>22    to Dulovic's testimony?</P>\n","<P>23       A.   Yes.  But this isn't the complete material.  My legal advisors</P>\n","<P>24    found many more texts of this kind and they quote them in extenso, and in</P>\n","<P>25    my submission I state my intention to disclose them in keeping with</P>\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Rule 67 of the rules of evidence.</P>\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, I have one more question</P>\n","<P> 3    [as interpreted] -- Robinson, I have a question for you.  As my associates</P>\n","<P> 4    have managed to come by a set of these or at least photocopies of the</P>\n","<P> 5    papers from 1991 which Mr. Seselj refers to in his submission to the other</P>\n","<P> 6    side, the presentation of these photocopies, is that sufficient grounds</P>\n","<P> 7    for my request that they be accepted as exhibits, that Mr. Seselj's</P>\n","<P> 8    submission be accepted as an exhibit?</P>\n","<P> 9            MR. NICE:  Rather interesting issues, I think, arise on the</P>\n","<P>10    validity of these documents as exhibits, and it may be necessary to go</P>\n","<P>11    back and remind ourselves of what Mr. Dulovic himself said about these</P>\n","<P>12    matters.  So I would respectfully invite the Chamber to put that matter</P>\n","<P>13    back.  But may we see the -- may we have access to this material tonight</P>\n","<P>14    in copy form in any event?  It may be we have them elsewhere, but it will</P>\n","<P>15    be a difficult task to find them and it may in any event not be an</P>\n","<P>16    identical collection.  I simply don't know.</P>\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, we'll have to consider the</P>\n","<P>18    application that you're making.  In the meantime, make -- have copies</P>\n","<P>19    available to the Prosecution and to the assigned counsel and to the</P>\n","<P>20    Chamber.</P>\n","<P>21            We'll have to adjourn now.

It's not better.\n","<P>16    [In English] You can try it.\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is it any better, Mr. --\n","<P>18            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, now it is better.\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Yes, we'll proceed.\n","<P>20            I was recalling for Mr. Kay's benefit, and Mr. Milosevic's, the\n","<P>21    evidence which Mr. Milosevic sought to lead through this witness of what\n","<P>22    he said were discrepancies between Prosecution witnesses Dulovic and\n","<P>23    Anastasijevic's evidence given in this court and evidence which they gave\n","<P>24    in a special court in Belgrade.  I had indicated to him that there are\n","<P>25    other ways of introducing that evidence which he felt was important to his\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    case, and I'm going to ask the assigned counsel to investigate this\n","<P> 2    matter, to get hold of the transcript, and I would leave it to their\n","<P> 3    discretion to -- whether to seek to lead that evidence through whatever\n","<P> 4    means is appropriate.\n","<P> 5            MR.

KAY:  It seemed to us on Friday whether we discussed this\n","<P> 8    issue, Ms. Higgins and myself, that the obvious way forward was to have\n","<P> 9    the original transcripts of the hearing set against the evidence that was\n","<P>10    given here so that the issues of the discrepancies can be seen from the\n","<P>11    primary material.\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Yes.  I would not want this evidence to be\n","<P>13    lost to the accused, and that is why I'm asking assigned counsel to\n","<P>14    investigate the matter.\n","<P>15            MR. KAY:  We will.\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thanks.\n","<P>17            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>18                          WITNESS:  VOJISLAV SESELJ [Resumed]\n","<P>19                          [Witness answered through interpreter]\n","<P>20                          Examined by Mr. Milosevic:  [Continued]\n","<P>21       Q.   [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some\n","<P>22    questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian\n","<P>23    indictment, that have to do with the \"Rump Presidency\" as it's called\n","<P>24    here.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  \"The Rump Presidency\n","<P>25    carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies,\" and so on and so forth, \"had\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    effect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief.\"\n","<P> 2            I'm not going to ask you to repeat what you've already said, but\n","<P> 3    in relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of\n","<P> 4    Serbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they\n","<P> 5    not take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency\n","<P> 6    of the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any\n","<P> 7    objective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from\n","<P> 8    carrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?\n","<P> 9            The question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,\n","<P>10    Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the\n","<P>11    SFRY Presidency in Belgrade?\n","<P>12       A.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,\n","<P>13    staying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was\n","<P>14    never a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from\n","<P>15    carrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped\n","<P>16    coming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had\n","<P>17    practically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe\n","<P>18    Mesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying\n","<P>19    that they could not come because they could not strike a balance in\n","<P>20    relation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and\n","<P>21    Montenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.\n","<P>22            The representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were\n","<P>23    not expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was\n","<P>24    actually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display\n","<P>25    such feelings at the time.  It's only when he left Belgrade and when he\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    came back to the Croatian parliament that he said, \"I've completed my\n","<P> 2    duty.  Yugoslavia is no more.\"\n","<P> 3            He pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.\n","<P> 4    Also, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him\n","<P> 5    sufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he\n","<P> 6    condemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most\n","<P> 7    cooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was\n","<P> 8    what he was.\n","<P> 9            I already said that according to the constitution of the then\n","<P>10    Yugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one\n","<P>11    single member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been\n","<P>12    prevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could\n","<P>13    have gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could\n","<P>14    have refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the\n","<P>15    Presidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the\n","<P>16    Presidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed\n","<P>17    within the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably\n","<P>18    before Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a\n","<P>19    Rump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of\n","<P>20    a rump Presidency.\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>23       Q.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  \"Slobodan Milosevic,\n","<P>24    in his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that\n","<P>25    Yugoslavia was finished.\"\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            Please, you've got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I'm not\n","<P> 2    going to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much\n","<P> 3    time.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to\n","<P> 4    here or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that\n","<P> 5    Yugoslavia was finished?\n","<P> 6       A.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say\n","<P> 7    that Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you\n","<P> 8    never said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I\n","<P> 9    remember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the\n","<P>10    behaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went\n","<P>11    through a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,\n","<P>12    constitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,\n","<P>13    but then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional\n","<P>14    provision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases\n","<P>15    to exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the\n","<P>16    matter.\n","<P>17            The leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never\n","<P>18    did it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and\n","<P>19    Croatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and\n","<P>20    Macedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro\n","<P>21    proclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting\n","<P>22    of two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration\n","<P>23    on your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   \"In March 1991 the collective Presidency of the SFRY reached a\n","<P> 2    deadlock on several issues.\"  That is paragraph 56.\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... that sentence\n","<P> 4    which is at the beginning of the paragraph.  There's another allegation in\n","<P> 5    that last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no\n","<P> 6    longer be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask\n","<P> 7    Mr. Seselj whether that is so.\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember\n","<P> 9    at that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian\n","<P>10    public, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the\n","<P>11    decisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that\n","<P>12    Serbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation\n","<P>13    when the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.\n","<P>14            I would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there\n","<P>15    was a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the\n","<P>16    headquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long\n","<P>17    debate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the\n","<P>18    demand of the military to declare a state of emergency.\n","<P>19            The top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the\n","<P>20    behaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a\n","<P>21    vote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.  As far as I can\n","<P>22    remember --\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You have answered the question I asked, thanks.\n","<P>24            Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   That is what is referred to here.  It says the representatives on\n","<P> 2    the Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,\n","<P> 3    the autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of\n","<P> 4    Kosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what\n","<P> 5    was so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the\n","<P> 6    Presidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?\n","<P> 7       A.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also\n","<P> 8    start the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven't got the document here\n","<P> 9    so I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were\n","<P>10    actually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already\n","<P>11    started putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the\n","<P>12    Presidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the\n","<P>13    Presidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not\n","<P>14    very constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the\n","<P>15    Presidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,\n","<P>16    or Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.\n","<P>17    I think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been\n","<P>18    recalled in the meantime.\n","<P>19       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that\n","<P>20    session or before that session or in relation to that session I never\n","<P>21    declared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did\n","<P>22    they declare that Yugoslavia was finished?\n","<P>23       A.   I've already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian\n","<P>24    politicians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was\n","<P>25    one of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    hard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.\n","<P> 2            As for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in\n","<P> 3    Montenegro either.\n","<P> 4       Q.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to\n","<P> 5    normal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic\n","<P> 6    was elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented\n","<P> 7    Vojvodina at the time.\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the\n","<P> 9    Presidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started\n","<P>10    working again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its\n","<P>11    work.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of\n","<P>12    Bosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil\n","<P>13    Tupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new\n","<P>14    crisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be\n","<P>15    elected president of the Presidency.\n","<P>16            There was a principle involved that the president of the\n","<P>17    Presidency was elected from a different republican province every year but\n","<P>18    nobody's election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic\n","<P>19    did not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European\n","<P>20    envoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to\n","<P>21    elect him nevertheless.\n","<P>22       Q.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?\n","<P>23       A.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting\n","<P>24    the preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from\n","<P>25    those positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says\n","<P> 2    that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and\n","<P> 3    discussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between\n","<P> 4    Serbia and Croatia?\n","<P> 5       A.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I\n","<P> 6    remember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what\n","<P> 7    was skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching\n","<P> 8    agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the\n","<P> 9    Bosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a\n","<P>10    situation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it\n","<P>11    increasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the\n","<P>12    country at the time.\n","<P>13            At that time, I -- as I've already said, the presidents of the\n","<P>14    presidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys\n","<P>15    had actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach\n","<P>16    agreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia\n","<P>17    increasingly so.\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through\n","<P>19    what medium?\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully\n","<P>21    being bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media\n","<P>22    this kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were\n","<P>23    already at that time being financed from the West by different Western\n","<P>24    intelligence agencies, so that's the kind of media I'm talking about.  In\n","<P>25    Belgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    federal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic\n","<P> 2    government, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government\n","<P> 3    in Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the\n","<P> 4    Western powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante\n","<P> 5    Markovic's government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible\n","<P> 6    agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia\n","<P> 7    together under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been\n","<P> 8    eliminated.\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>11       Q.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at\n","<P>12    one stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence\n","<P>13    counsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest\n","<P>14    collaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This\n","<P>15    denies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of\n","<P>16    Bosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted\n","<P>17    into evidence and if not we will find this transcript.\n","<P>18            However, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with\n","<P>19    you as you were an active participant in all political events.  This\n","<P>20    meeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the\n","<P>21    division of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any\n","<P>22    member of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning\n","<P>23    of which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way\n","<P>24    even indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?\n","<P>25       A.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    if Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia\n","<P> 2    as an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as\n","<P> 3    a constituent nation as they had been before in the previous\n","<P> 4    constitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the\n","<P> 5    first president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it\n","<P> 6    was not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint\n","<P> 7    state.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans\n","<P> 8    persuaded him to call off the agreement.\n","<P> 9       Q.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It\n","<P>10    says:  \"On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY\n","<P>11    Presidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,\n","<P>12    Sejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY\n","<P>13    Presidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the\n","<P>14    Presidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and\n","<P>15    Macedonia.\"\n","<P>16            On the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.  Was this\n","<P>17    a kind of takeover of the function of the Presidency or were these\n","<P>18    functions being carried out by the legal representatives?\n","<P>19       A.   There was absolutely no takeover.  When four of the members of the\n","<P>20    Presidency withdrew and some of them officially gave notice that they were\n","<P>21    no longer members, like Drnovsek, for instance, while others simply\n","<P>22    stopped attending the sessions.  The Presidency continued working with the\n","<P>23    members who -- whom it was possible to gather together.\n","<P>24            I suggest that the Chamber get hold of this piece of legislation.\n","<P>25    I cannot quote it verbatim right now, but I'm absolutely sure it existed.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    And according to this piece of legislation, even if the majority of\n","<P> 2    members could not meet, the Presidency under certain circumstances would\n","<P> 3    continue working with the members who were present.\n","<P> 4            Let me remind you that in the spring of 1991 or in the early\n","<P> 5    summer, there was a vote taken to declare a imminent threat of war.\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 65 it says:  \"On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,\n","<P> 7    Slobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal\n","<P> 8    enterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from\n","<P> 9    Belgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the\n","<P>10    mobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay\n","<P>11    in Yugoslavia.\"\n","<P>12            First of all, let's establish when I began advocating a unitary\n","<P>13    Serb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And\n","<P>14    secondly, was this anyone's idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,\n","<P>15    and is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever\n","<P>16    been a unitary state?\n","<P>17       A.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally\n","<P>19    and your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt\n","<P>20    the new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the\n","<P>21    autonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the\n","<P>22    Serb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of\n","<P>23    autonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an\n","<P>24    option.\n","<P>25            Furthermore, when the four former federal units had already been\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    recognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the\n","<P> 2    Montenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be\n","<P> 3    promulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump\n","<P> 4    Yugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would\n","<P> 5    have been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -\n","<P> 6    because that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary\n","<P> 7    Serbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this\n","<P> 8    but didn't want to, and I am sorry that you didn't do that, because up to\n","<P> 9    the point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --\n","<P>10    in Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It\n","<P>11    appeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.\n","<P>12       Q.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any\n","<P>13    of my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who\n","<P>14    were allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had\n","<P>15    any kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?\n","<P>16       A.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated\n","<P>17    with you advocated such an idea.\n","<P>18       Q.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it\n","<P>19    says here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of\n","<P>20    reservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the\n","<P>21    reasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was\n","<P>22    called for?\n","<P>23       A.   I'm not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation\n","<P>24    of reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to\n","<P>25    mobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    to take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the\n","<P> 2    territorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that\n","<P> 3    this mobilisation didn't go well.  The response was very poor, because\n","<P> 4    Veljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn't want to remove the\n","<P> 5    communist insignia from the military uniforms.\n","<P> 6            The Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the\n","<P> 7    Presidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was\n","<P> 8    Prime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in\n","<P> 9    Slovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of\n","<P>10    such an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops\n","<P>11    into Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then\n","<P>12    leadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as\n","<P>13    I know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership\n","<P>14    which had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.\n","<P>15       Q.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your\n","<P>16    name, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask\n","<P>17    you now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of\n","<P>18    April, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan's and\n","<P>19    Seselj's men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you\n","<P>20    know anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and\n","<P>21    cart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of\n","<P>22    cooperation with Arkan's volunteer guard?\n","<P>23       A.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","<P>24    did not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert\n","<P>25    that, I'm saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    organised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as\n","<P> 2    much as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.\n","<P> 3    That's a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb\n","<P> 4    Radical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty\n","<P> 5    to Serbia.  I guarantee that.\n","<P> 6            The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict\n","<P> 7    instructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb\n","<P> 8    volunteer guard up to the --\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm asking why was that instruction given to the\n","<P>10    volunteers of the Serb Radical Party?\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.\n","<P>12    We didn't want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn't\n","<P>13    want people's awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.\n","<P>14            As I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,\n","<P>15    long before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had\n","<P>16    quarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was\n","<P>17    in danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this\n","<P>18    in the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding\n","<P>20    that instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with\n","<P>21    Arkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You're\n","<P>22    not there with them.\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can't say that not a single\n","<P>24    volunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There's one\n","<P>25    instance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    teacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical\n","<P> 2    Party.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of\n","<P> 3    about 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back\n","<P> 4    but, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of\n","<P> 5    Arkan's men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.\n","<P> 6            So, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint\n","<P> 7    military activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with\n","<P> 8    Arkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a\n","<P> 9    distance from Arkan.\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.\n","<P>11            Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>13       Q.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on\n","<P>14    transcript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia\n","<P>15    took place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj's\n","<P>16    White Eagles.\n","<P>17            First of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and\n","<P>18    secondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj's White Eagles?\n","<P>19       A.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb\n","<P>20    people organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have\n","<P>21    already said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of\n","<P>22    volunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After\n","<P>23    that, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we\n","<P>24    had volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never\n","<P>25    had anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            There was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo\n","<P> 2    Selo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he\n","<P> 3    was killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not\n","<P> 4    carrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no\n","<P> 5    joint military activities.\n","<P> 6       Q.   Let's clarify this.  It doesn't say here that you cooperated.  It\n","<P> 7    says here:  \"With infiltration of Seselj's White Eagles.\"  So the White\n","<P> 8    Eagles are being ascribed to you.\n","<P> 9       A.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the\n","<P>10    Prosecutor bringing witnesses here who don't no anything about what\n","<P>11    happened on the ground.  It's simply nonsense to talk of a group called\n","<P>12    Seselj's White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and\n","<P>13    the Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn't know\n","<P>14    what he was talking about.\n","<P>15       Q.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,\n","<P>16    2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that \"Seselj collected men in\n","<P>17    Erdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia.\"  Is that\n","<P>18    true, Mr. Seselj?\n","<P>19            JUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493\n","<P>20    who testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake\n","<P>22    in my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that\n","<P>23    particular page, and the page is 19003.\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    them to Bosnia?\n","<P> 2       A.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in\n","<P> 3    Erdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,\n","<P> 4    nicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only\n","<P> 5    time.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --\n","<P> 6    we never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there\n","<P> 7    either, and I can state that quite categorically.\n","<P> 8            The people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the\n","<P> 9    war and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were\n","<P>10    exclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I\n","<P>11    absolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan's centre in Erdut\n","<P>12    later on.  We never had anything to do with it.\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is\n","<P>14    20294, says that Arkan's and Seselj's men shot above the heads of the\n","<P>15    civilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in\n","<P>16    Bratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who\n","<P>17    mistreated and abused the civilians?\n","<P>18       A.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian\n","<P>19    Radical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my\n","<P>20    knowledge Arkan didn't appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in\n","<P>21    Zvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in\n","<P>22    Bratunac either.  And I've already said that in Bratunac there was\n","<P>23    Deronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there\n","<P>24    I was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have\n","<P>25    very certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj's men were\n","<P> 2    in Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj's\n","<P> 3    mean there is no difference, says he.\n","<P> 4       A.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can't see any\n","<P> 5    difference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the\n","<P> 6    White Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at\n","<P> 7    all.  And that's not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some\n","<P> 8    judgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to\n","<P> 9    see in some other places Seselj's White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the\n","<P>10    problem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses\n","<P>11    which it manipulates.\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on\n","<P>13    several occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven't been able to check this myself\n","<P>15    because the accused hasn't been getting the references correct, and it's\n","<P>16    quite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I'm grateful to\n","<P>17    Ms. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came\n","<P>18    (redacted).\n","<P>19    But, really, I'm afraid we've got to have correct references for the\n","<P>20    witnesses.  We can't simply just go to the page in the transcript.\n","<P>21    Frequently our page numbers don't necessarily coincide here in court, and\n","<P>22    without reference to the witnesses it's very difficult to pick it up\n","<P>23    later.\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in\n","<P>25    pinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you're referring.  Now,\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Judge Kwon has already corrected you once, and apparently there is another\n","<P> 2    mistake in the reference.\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, perhaps there might be a\n","<P> 4    mistake with the name, but there is no mistake with the quotation from the\n","<P> 5    transcript, and my question relates to the material facts which are being\n","<P> 6    mentioned here.\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, we have to follow it, Mr. Milosevic.  There\n","<P> 8    is duty on you to be more careful.\n","<P> 9            Please proceed.\n","<P>10            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. Robinson.  And I'll\n","<P>11    check this out to see whether indeed it is the same witness from\n","<P>12    page 20352, the transcript line and page, the quotation that I mentioned\n","<P>13    earlier on or, rather, 20351 is the exact number.  I'll check that out\n","<P>14    during the break.\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>16       Q.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript\n","<P>17    said that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of\n","<P>18    March, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan's men took part as well as\n","<P>19    Seselj's men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the\n","<P>20    occupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on\n","<P>21    the 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of\n","<P>22    your volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?\n","<P>23       A.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What\n","<P>24    happened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between\n","<P>25    the JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Muslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.\n","<P> 2    However, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went\n","<P> 3    on for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting\n","<P> 4    the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was\n","<P> 5    there, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my\n","<P> 6    knowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of\n","<P> 7    the local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to\n","<P> 8    establish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the\n","<P> 9    ground there.\n","<P>10            I know -- have reliable information that the commands and the\n","<P>11    officers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan's and\n","<P>12    the Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a\n","<P>13    great deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very\n","<P>14    rarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.\n","<P>15            As far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,\n","<P>16    over there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did\n","<P>17    appear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the\n","<P>18    call of Biljana Plavsic.  I can't prove that, but I do know that Biljana\n","<P>19    Plavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly\n","<P>20    meeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The\n","<P>21    volunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina\n","<P>22    were not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the\n","<P>23    Serbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were\n","<P>24    residents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the\n","<P>25    conflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    and Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan's right-hand man.  And in\n","<P> 2    Serbia we didn't send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something\n","<P> 4    for me in relation to the Prosecution's case.  In the Bosnia indictment\n","<P> 5    the allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other\n","<P> 6    members of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the\n","<P> 7    Prosecution case unfolded, you're not saying, are you, that he acted\n","<P> 8    alone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with\n","<P> 9    other members of the joint criminal enterprise.\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven't reviewed each and every allegation\n","<P>11    to check that there isn't one there that may be susceptible to individual\n","<P>12    perpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he's working with others.\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Yes.\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually\n","<P>16    your case.  It's not that he acted alone.\n","<P>17            MR. NICE:  Subject to the point I've just made.\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you've made, yes.\n","<P>19            MR. NICE:  Yes.\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Thank you.\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>22       Q.   Very well, Mr. Seselj.  You've just heard that explanation too.\n","<P>23    Now, since you know the relationships very well between people at that\n","<P>24    time, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and\n","<P>25    Zvornik yourself.  Now, did I or any organs of power and authority have\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    anything to do with Arkan's volunteer guard?\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet.\n","<P> 3            MR. NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and\n","<P> 4    I think perhaps there's this qualification, although I don't think it is a\n","<P> 5    qualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this\n","<P> 6    accused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top\n","<P> 7    political level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are\n","<P> 8    criminal in nature.  It's the standard method of generation of\n","<P> 9    genocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar\n","<P>10    [phoen].\n","<P>11            Now, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other\n","<P>12    people.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may\n","<P>13    be minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in\n","<P>14    those circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting\n","<P>15    alone in certain circumstances, but that's the only qualification I think\n","<P>16    I should make.\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it's a point that will warrant some\n","<P>18    consideration later on, yes.\n","<P>19            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>20            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>21       Q.   So Arkan is mentioned here as well as Mauzer.  Did I or anybody\n","<P>22    else from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all\n","<P>23    and with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?\n","<P>24       A.   I'm quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.\n","<P>25    On the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    contacts with Arkan.\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many\n","<P> 3    questions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the\n","<P> 4    evidence he's giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,\n","<P> 5    how is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan\n","<P> 6    or Mauzer?\n","<P> 7            He's giving evidence.  He's saying that you had nothing to do with\n","<P> 8    him.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to\n","<P> 9    establish how he's in a position to make that statement.\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>11       Q.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that\n","<P>12    cannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from\n","<P>13    the authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or\n","<P>14    relationship with Arkan or Mauzer?\n","<P>15       A.   In Belgrade you couldn't hide anything like that.  It would be\n","<P>16    impossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is\n","<P>17    that kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become\n","<P>18    public.\n","<P>19            Second, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts\n","<P>20    only with Zoran Djindjic.  And I've already spoken about the relationship\n","<P>21    between Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic's vice-president and the\n","<P>22    president of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his\n","<P>23    pre-electoral campaign.\n","<P>24       Q.   Let's clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did\n","<P>25    you have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    able to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in\n","<P> 2    Bijeljina?\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina\n","<P> 4    sufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,\n","<P> 5    including Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this\n","<P> 6    trial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events\n","<P> 7    that went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in\n","<P> 8    Bijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements\n","<P> 9    and held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and\n","<P>10    severely criticised Mauzer's conduct, especially Mauzer's conduct towards\n","<P>11    the Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am\n","<P>12    preparing them for my own trial, which doesn't seem to be starting.\n","<P>13       Q.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack\n","<P>14    on the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the\n","<P>15    JNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by\n","<P>16    the Red Berets or, rather, Arkan's and Seselj's men.  So that's the\n","<P>17    quotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan's\n","<P>18    and Seselj's men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red\n","<P>19    Berets were they?  What Arkan's men were they, Seselj's men were they\n","<P>20    around Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?\n","<P>21       A.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the\n","<P>22    witness don't seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened\n","<P>23    to see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red\n","<P>24    cap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.\n","<P>25    And then he -- the witness doesn't know whether they were Seselj's men or\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Arkan's men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it's\n","<P> 2    highly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of\n","<P> 3    his head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify\n","<P> 4    so-called Seselj's men and Arkan's men and these alleged Red Berets.\n","<P> 5            As for the Red Berets, I've already given you reliable facts about\n","<P> 6    them and said that name appeared in different situations relating to\n","<P> 7    different military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina\n","<P> 8    area where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then\n","<P> 9    the army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of\n","<P>10    the intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until\n","<P>11    the special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of\n","<P>12    Serbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this\n","<P>13    misunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed\n","<P>14    to people with -- which they had nothing to do with.\n","<P>15       Q.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the\n","<P>16    following:  \"Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia\n","<P>17    who were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done.\"\n","<P>18    That's when this witness claims.\n","<P>19       A.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He's a colonel by\n","<P>20    rank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff\n","<P>21    of the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the\n","<P>22    number two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that's the same\n","<P>23    Osman Selak that you're referring to.\n","<P>24       Q.   Well, I can't tell you that.\n","<P>25       A.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a\n","<P> 2    statement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,\n","<P> 3    what the circumstances were in which I said it.\n","<P> 4            I did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the\n","<P> 5    secession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia\n","<P> 6    seceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,\n","<P> 7    and for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he\n","<P> 8    personally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.\n","<P> 9            As far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from\n","<P>10    Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of\n","<P>11    Yugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and\n","<P>12    Raska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of\n","<P>13    examples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army\n","<P>14    perform their duty very honourably.\n","<P>15            So the citizens --\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","<P>17            JUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are\n","<P>18    saying that you did make such a statement or you didn't make such a\n","<P>19    statement.\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if\n","<P>21    you don't show me something like that here, where and when.  Let us see\n","<P>22    the statement concerned.  Let me identify it.  I gave thousands and\n","<P>23    thousands of statements in public.  They were publicly recorded.  They\n","<P>24    were published.  So let's see.\n","<P>25            My objection is precisely in that.  Why did this Osman Selak not\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    say where and when?\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's helpful to some extent.  Does it follow from\n","<P> 3    the answer you've just given that you could have said it?\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I could have said it along the\n","<P> 5    following lines, that those in the army who came from the renegade\n","<P> 6    republics in principle should not remain at positions in the Yugoslav\n","<P> 7    army.  You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live\n","<P> 8    in Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in\n","<P> 9    the army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as\n","<P>10    officers?\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's simply confusing me further.  The quote was\n","<P>12    that you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims\n","<P>13    and Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that\n","<P>14    you could possibly have made that statement in these terms?\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not saying that I made that kind\n","<P>16    of statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak\n","<P>17    testified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise\n","<P>18    lines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman\n","<P>19    Selak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be\n","<P>20    established.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the\n","<P>21    Prosecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly\n","<P>22    what I said.\n","<P>23            I am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,\n","<P>24    but it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you're asking me to do is\n","<P>25    to comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Selak's view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make\n","<P> 2    my statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.\n","<P> 3            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm\n","<P> 4    trying to understand the answer you've given to the question asked by\n","<P> 5    Mr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you've just said, the problem is\n","<P> 6    that you've been studying this yourself, and you're trying to justify a\n","<P> 7    position of your own without really dealing specifically with the question\n","<P> 8    that's being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears\n","<P> 9    now to be that you couldn't possibly have made a statement of that nature,\n","<P>10    although you might have said something much more specific about different\n","<P>11    people but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.\n","<P>12            Now, is that a fair summary of your position?\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I'm not sure, by think you're\n","<P>14    very close.  However, in order to help you, I'm going to give you an\n","<P>15    example.\n","<P>16            Throughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were\n","<P>17    informed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,\n","<P>18    escaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of\n","<P>19    confidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998\n","<P>20    we had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of\n","<P>21    the military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his\n","<P>22    family abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives\n","<P>23    there.\n","<P>24            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn't remotely sound as if it's\n","<P>25    going to be at all helpful to me, so we'll proceed with Mr. Milosevic's\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    questions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you\n","<P> 2    was about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist\n","<P> 3    statement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple\n","<P> 4    issue I'm not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further\n","<P> 5    if he wishes.\n","<P> 6            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in\n","<P>11    no uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that\n","<P>12    any statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never\n","<P>13    in my life have I made a racist statement.\n","<P>14            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>18       Q.   Mr. Seselj --\n","<P>19            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  There's nothing for you to respond to.\n","<P>21            Mr. Milosevic, the next question.\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>23       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I'm afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I\n","<P>24    put a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific\n","<P>25    terms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    here that \"Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia\n","<P> 2    who were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed.\"  Did you ever state\n","<P> 3    that?\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I didn't say it that way.\n","<P> 5       Q.   So you didn't say it that way --\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... matter.\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  And why on earth it should take all this time to\n","<P> 8    establish that simple issue, I do not know.\n","<P> 9            Perhaps it would help, Mr. Seselj, if you just listened to the\n","<P>10    questions and answer the question that's actually asked rather than try to\n","<P>11    make political statements about your own position.\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic --\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not making political statements,\n","<P>14    Mr. Bonomy.\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>16       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He\n","<P>17    mentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether\n","<P>18    those facts are correct.  And first of all, I'm interested in the\n","<P>19    circumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  \"Just after\n","<P>20    the bombing Seselj came to Pale.\"  And then on page 26762 he\n","<P>21    says:  \"Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to\n","<P>22    support the Bosnian Serbs.\"  These are a few facts that referred to.\n","<P>23    Could you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this\n","<P>24    actually all about?\n","<P>25       A.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the\n","<P> 2    leadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly\n","<P> 3    engaged in an anti-Serb policy.\n","<P> 4            As for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market\n","<P> 5    itself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the\n","<P> 6    street of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these\n","<P> 7    are explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of\n","<P> 8    whether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar\n","<P> 9    shells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.\n","<P>10            This was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the\n","<P>11    Serbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the\n","<P>12    threats that were made, and so on and so forth.\n","<P>13       Q.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there\n","<P>14    you did so only to give political support to the leadership of\n","<P>15    Republika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and\n","<P>16    bombing.\n","<P>17       A.   Yes.\n","<P>18       Q.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  \"In January or February\n","<P>19    1992\" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, \"Arkan's\n","<P>20    and Seselj's units arrived in Doboj.\"\n","<P>21            Is this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?\n","<P>22       A.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,\n","<P>23    there were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.\n","<P>24            Secondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to\n","<P>25    Doboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan's Tigers never\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    operated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to\n","<P> 3    this question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on\n","<P> 4    transcript page 27738, quite explicitly, \"Mirko Blagojevic,\" that is to\n","<P> 5    say, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he\n","<P> 6    says:  \"Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,\n","<P> 7    and he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with\n","<P> 8    Seselj.\"\n","<P> 9            I am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical\n","<P>10    Party or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that\n","<P>11    Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So\n","<P>12    please deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the\n","<P>13    transcript.  Is it correct or not?\n","<P>14       A.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is\n","<P>15    organised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A\n","<P>16    conflict occurs when two armed formations clash.\n","<P>17            Mirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in\n","<P>18    Bijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim\n","<P>19    formations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any\n","<P>20    conflicts.  And I guarantee with my own life that he took part in no\n","<P>21    looting, no persecutions, no maltreatment of the civilian population and\n","<P>22    so on and so forth.  I'm absolutely certain of that.\n","<P>23       Q.   Thank you.\n","<P>24       A.   I can fully identify with everything that Mirko Blagojevic did.\n","<P>25    It is to that degree that I'm certain that he never did anything against\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the law.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  \"Seselj's\n","<P> 3    men tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm.\"\n","<P> 4       A.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?\n","<P> 5       Q.   My understanding is it's somewhere near Zvornik.\n","<P> 6       A.   That's quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","<P> 7    Party took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there\n","<P> 8    in brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on\n","<P> 9    for a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the\n","<P>10    Muslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to\n","<P>11    an end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","<P>12    withdrew.\n","<P>13            I preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on\n","<P>14    guarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing\n","<P>15    happened, I would have had to know about it.\n","<P>16       Q.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you\n","<P>17    personally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following\n","<P>18    circumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  \"Seselj,\n","<P>19    on Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired\n","<P>20    it at Muslims in Sarajevo.\"  This was shown on television, and he said\n","<P>21    that you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.\n","<P>22       A.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at\n","<P>23    Grbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called\n","<P>24    international observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go\n","<P>25    around the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Serb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was\n","<P> 2    an apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I\n","<P> 3    used a Browning machine-gun from there.  It's a heavy machine-gun.  I\n","<P> 4    couldn't carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry\n","<P> 5    it around.\n","<P> 6       Q.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.\n","<P> 7       A.   You cannot carry it.  It's too long.  It was installed in that\n","<P> 8    building, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches\n","<P> 9    below the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of\n","<P>10    the volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was\n","<P>11    firing from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and\n","<P>12    the top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is\n","<P>13    something I don't know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who\n","<P>14    could have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this\n","<P>15    small participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.\n","<P>16            A Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that\n","<P>17    case, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been\n","<P>18    forced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of\n","<P>19    those who in violation of international law of war brought him out there\n","<P>20    to dig trenches, not those who --\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>23       Q.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,\n","<P>24    that at the beginning of April Seselj's men arrived in the area of\n","<P>25    Bratunac and Zvornik.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic's part.  He knows\n","<P> 2    full well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing\n","<P> 3    who he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and\n","<P> 4    making this sweeping statement Seselj's men arrived in Bratunac and\n","<P> 5    Zvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it's as if they were in Bratunac\n","<P> 6    too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so\n","<P> 7    Deronjic invented that.\n","<P> 8            In Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the\n","<P> 9    Bratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was\n","<P>10    commander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he\n","<P>11    was not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,\n","<P>12    then a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.  I think the interpreter is having\n","<P>14    some difficulty.\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will.\n","<P>16            You could have noticed, Mr. Robinson, that I have been trying as\n","<P>17    of late to speak slowly, but sometimes, every now and then, I may forget\n","<P>18    what you cautioned me about.\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, I had noticed, and the -- we are\n","<P>20    appreciative of the effort you are making.  You have answered the\n","<P>21    question.\n","<P>22            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the meantime --\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think you have answered that question.\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>25       Q.   So they were not in Bratunac at all?\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in\n","<P> 2    Bratunac.\n","<P> 3       Q.   All right.  So you are saying that he's not telling the truth.\n","<P> 4            The same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not\n","<P> 5    agree that Seselj was a true opposition.\n","<P> 6       A.   The Hague OTP and Judge Schomburg on several occasions caught\n","<P> 7    Deronjic lying.  And even in Deronjic's judgement you can find about seven\n","<P> 8    different points as ascertained by Judge Schomburg, namely that Deronjic\n","<P> 9    was lying.\n","<P>10            Secondly, in the case of people who are inclined to a pro-Western\n","<P>11    policy or are mercenaries of Western intelligence agencies, or in order to\n","<P>12    save their own skin they go into plea bargaining with the OTP and\n","<P>13    therefore appear as witnesses in the trials of other people, it can often\n","<P>14    be heard that those who are really opposition but are not prepared to\n","<P>15    serve the West --\n","<P>16            MR. NICE:  I'm not sure this is responsive to any question --\n","<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Are you interrupting me?\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet, Mr. Seselj, and he's\n","<P>19    entitled to make an objection if he wishes.\n","<P>20            MR. NICE:  He was simply asked if the man was telling the truth.\n","<P>21    We have his answer and he's now gone on to a long comment basically.\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, you have moved into the area of comment.\n","<P>23            It's now time for the break.\n","<P>24            Mr. Nice, I should say the question that I asked earlier related\n","<P>25    to the Bosnia indictment.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            We will break for 20 minutes.\n","<P> 2                          --- Recess taken at 3.41 p.m.\n","<P> 3                          --- On resuming at 4.08 p.m.\n","<P> 4            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, you told me to check\n","<P> 6    the pages that Mr. Nice mentioned, 35 -- 20352 and 20351, that is.  This\n","<P> 7    was Witness 1070.\n","<P> 8            On page 20351 he says that Seselj's men were in Bratunac and that\n","<P> 9    there was no difference between them and Seselj's men, the White Eagles,\n","<P>10    that is.\n","<P>11            And on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April\n","<P>12    Seselj's and Arkan's men were in Bratunac together when some people were\n","<P>13    deported.  And Mr. Seselj answered questions about this.  In the meantime,\n","<P>14    the liaison officer had the transcript, and I have received a note saying\n","<P>15    that both references are correct, both as regards page 20351 and 20352,\n","<P>16    and these refer to Witness 1070.  There was no error.\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  All right, Mr. Milosevic.  We'll do our own\n","<P>18    check.  Thank you for checking anyhow.\n","<P>19            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>20       Q.   Mr. Seselj, this is the testimony of Miroslav Deronjic, who said\n","<P>21    that you were not truly an opposition politician or, rather, that you\n","<P>22    cooperated with the government and that therefore this idea of a joint\n","<P>23    criminal enterprise is thereby confirmed.  Were you in the opposition or\n","<P>24    not?\n","<P>25            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it\n","<P> 2    on.\n","<P> 3            Both the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time\n","<P> 4    were distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as\n","<P> 5    it's possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by\n","<P> 6    Deronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the\n","<P> 7    opposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint\n","<P> 8    often expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various\n","<P> 9    government and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person\n","<P>10    of the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or\n","<P>11    Miles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery\n","<P>12    and so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while\n","<P>13    criticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition\n","<P>14    politicians, and this logic is completely upside down.\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>16       Q.   Witness Ahmet Zulic says, and that's on page 30000 of the\n","<P>17    transcript, he says that Seselj's men were stationed in the partisan\n","<P>18    cemetery in Pobrezje, that doesn't matter so much but what matters is the\n","<P>19    following, that they had come there to kill the Muslims.\n","<P>20       A.   Where is this place?  Pobrezje?  Where is it?\n","<P>21       Q.   I have a note here in Pobrezje.  I can't be more specific than\n","<P>22    that.\n","<P>23            But let me put a question to you:  Did your volunteers go anywhere\n","<P>24    to kill all Muslims?\n","<P>25       A.   No.  Nowhere did the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party go to\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    kill Muslims or Croats or any kind of civilians.  Wherever they went, they\n","<P> 2    were part of the JNA, and they went there to fight against the\n","<P> 3    paramilitary units that wanted to break up Yugoslavia.\n","<P> 4            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, it's important to know the\n","<P> 5    location.  I'm not sure whether Mr. Nice or Mr. Kay can help.  Your note\n","<P> 6    doesn't identify clearly the name of this place?\n","<P> 7            MR. NICE:  I tried to make an electronic search but for various\n","<P> 8    reasons it doesn't work at the moment or doesn't work for this witness on\n","<P> 9    this particular part of his evidence.  I'll try again.\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  You said Pobrezje.\n","<P>12            Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>14       Q.   The same witness, Ahmet Zulic, on page 30047, says in Sanski Most\n","<P>15    there was no fighting, but the civilians fled because Seselj's men were\n","<P>16    there.\n","<P>17            Your men caused fear among civilians, although there was no\n","<P>18    fighting there, as he says, in Sanski Most.\n","<P>19       A.   That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,\n","<P>20    throughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did\n","<P>21    not fight in any location.\n","<P>22            This reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a\n","<P>23    certain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying\n","<P>24    that sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.\n","<P>25    Somebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    arriving, and he spread panic.\n","<P> 2            THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that the Serbian word for\n","<P> 3    sugar resembles Mr. Seselj's name.\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere\n","<P> 5    in that area.\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 7       Q.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  \"From the\n","<P> 8    1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan\n","<P> 9    Milosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint\n","<P>10    criminal,\" and so on,\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise\n","<P>11    aided and abetted,\" and so on and so forth, all these phrases, \"the\n","<P>12    planning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories\n","<P>13    of Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,\n","<P>14    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.\"\n","<P>15            Tell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in\n","<P>16    this joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged\n","<P>17    crimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made\n","<P>18    here?\n","<P>19       A.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from\n","<P>20    Serbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia\n","<P>21    and Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted\n","<P>22    to proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the\n","<P>23    will of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the\n","<P>24    West who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or\n","<P>25    execution or extermination.  There was no plan.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            When the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in\n","<P> 2    many places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only\n","<P> 3    where the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats\n","<P> 4    were in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,\n","<P> 5    not a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the\n","<P> 6    majority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They\n","<P> 7    had already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.\n","<P> 8       Q.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we\n","<P> 9    have already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the\n","<P>10    other places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,\n","<P>11    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in\n","<P>12    any kind of military activities?\n","<P>13       A.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in\n","<P>14    January, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but\n","<P>15    the UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,\n","<P>16    although they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was\n","<P>17    established, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be\n","\n","<P>18    disarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.\n","<P>19            The Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian\n","<P>20    villages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there\n","<P>21    were two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active\n","<P>22    in the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces\n","<P>23    in the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the\n","<P>24    only activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica\n","<P>25    area.  It was in the beginning of 1993.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            As for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,\n","<P> 2    I don't know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up\n","<P> 3    only in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all\n","<P> 4    over Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army\n","<P> 5    of the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska\n","<P> 6    Krajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his\n","<P> 7    volunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars\n","<P> 8    there, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.\n","<P> 9       Q.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed\n","<P>10    and what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy\n","<P>11    that we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in\n","<P>12    whole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and\n","<P>13    Herzegovina?\n","<P>14       A.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and\n","<P>15    there was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen\n","<P>16    happened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on\n","<P>17    their own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit\n","<P>18    murders or anything of the kind.\n","<P>19       Q.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war\n","<P>20    in Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the\n","<P>21    other participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by\n","<P>22    Mr. Nice.\n","<P>23            Look at paragraph 33.  We've just been discussing paragraph 32.  I\n","<P>24    won't read the beginning of paragraph 33 because it's the same:  \"From on\n","<P>25    or about the 1st of March, 1992,\" and so on and so forth, and then it\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    says:  \"On the territory of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa,\n","<P> 2    Bosanski Novi, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Sarajevo (Ilijas), Kljuc,\n","<P> 3    Kalinovik, Kotor Varos, Nevesinje, Sarajevo, Novi Grad, Sarajevo, Novo\n","<P> 4    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Rudo, Sanski Most, Srebrenica\n","<P> 5    again, Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\"  Please --\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You are finished reading that list.  Let me\n","<P> 7    remind you, Mr. Milosevic, that the Rule 98 bis decision found that there\n","<P> 8    was not enough evidence to support the allegation in paragraph 32 in\n","<P> 9    relation to some of the villages or municipalities mentioned.  In fact, as\n","<P>10    far as paragraph 32 is concerned, you need only concern yourself with\n","<P>11    Brcko, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Bijeljina, Kotor Varos, Kljuc,\n","<P>12    Bosanski Novi.  And I am checking to see whether the decision affected\n","<P>13    paragraph 33.\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, could you please let\n","<P>15    me know what evidence, as you say there was no evidence for these places,\n","<P>16    but what was the evidence that Mr. Nice presented here about the other\n","<P>17    places linking me --\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.  Mr. Milosevic, the Rule 98 bis\n","<P>19    decision was published and was available to you.  But I bring that to your\n","<P>20    attention so we don't waste time.  And I'll ask the legal officer to give\n","<P>21    me the information in relation to paragraph 33.\n","<P>22            Go ahead, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>23            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>24       Q.   As I was saying, Mr. Seselj, I read out a list here.  It's a long\n","<P>25    paragraph with all the names of the towns where I, together with others,\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    am charged with working for the extermination of Muslims and Croats.  You\n","<P> 2    know the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that\n","<P> 3    referred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded\n","<P> 4    in any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?\n","<P> 5       A.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted\n","<P> 6    to, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A\n","<P> 7    civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally\n","<P> 8    wanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a\n","<P> 9    constituent people.\n","<P>10            And the question arises from there where are the Serbs from\n","<P>11    Mostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from\n","<P>12    Travnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from\n","<P>13    many other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats\n","<P>14    during that civil war?\n","<P>15            After the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the\n","<P>16    population, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did\n","<P>17    take place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,\n","<P>18    in figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I\n","<P>19    can put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes\n","<P>20    crimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,\n","<P>21    sometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,\n","<P>22    criminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and\n","<P>23    revenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes\n","<P>24    did not exist.  That did not happen.\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    joint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I'd like\n","<P> 2    to draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of\n","<P> 3    December, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33\n","<P> 4    and indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns\n","<P> 5    are repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns\n","<P> 6    too.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.\n","<P> 7            So what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during\n","<P> 8    that period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of\n","<P> 9    December 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring\n","<P>10    Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n","<P>11       A.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia\n","<P>12    or, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It\n","<P>14    did not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help\n","<P>15    materially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs\n","<P>16    living over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different\n","<P>17    political relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership\n","<P>18    of Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in\n","<P>19    which those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep\n","<P>20    conflicts, and they didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues.\n","<P>21            So throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the\n","<P>22    indictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,\n","<P>23    the leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered\n","<P>24    in looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far\n","<P>25    accepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    attacked ourselves for our part.\n","<P> 2            So I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy\n","<P> 3    dating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact\n","<P> 4    that that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all\n","<P> 5    costs.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no\n","<P> 6    alternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at\n","<P> 7    the price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept\n","<P> 8    because they were not able to take such great concessions.\n","<P> 9       Q.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities\n","<P>10    of that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these\n","<P>11    towns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I\n","<P>12    personally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,\n","<P>13    et cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason\n","<P>14    explanation?\n","<P>15       A.   Yes, I do, and that's explanation is the following and the fact\n","<P>16    that through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,\n","<P>17    and --\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not\n","<P>19    an explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.\n","<P>20            So please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,\n","<P>23    Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac\n","<P>24    again, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in\n","<P>25    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with\n","<P> 2    regard to that point of the indictment?\n","<P> 3       A.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised\n","<P> 4    crime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don't know whether in all the\n","<P> 5    places enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took\n","<P> 6    place in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each\n","<P> 7    individual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the\n","<P> 8    motives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are\n","<P> 9    still living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can\n","<P>10    be established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side\n","<P>11    and the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to\n","<P>12    investigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to\n","<P>13    strike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the\n","<P>14    number of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.\n","<P>15       Q.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you've said when you said\n","<P>16    that some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let's look at\n","<P>17    that for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or\n","<P>19    formations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes\n","<P>20    that you know of?  Are there any links?\n","<P>21       A.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of\n","<P>22    power and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as\n","<P>23    well, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,\n","<P>24    the Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the\n","<P>25    Academy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    everybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out\n","<P> 2    against them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for\n","<P> 3    freedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were\n","<P> 4    being perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes\n","<P> 5    should be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind\n","<P> 6    via the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political\n","<P> 7    parties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which\n","<P> 8    strove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors\n","<P> 9    spoke out against crimes.\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","<P>11            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>12       Q.   Now, we -- let's look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful\n","<P>13    confinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,\n","<P>14    Bosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the\n","<P>15    territories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,\n","<P>16    Samac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,\n","<P>17    Kotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,\n","<P>18    Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\n","<P>19            Tell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these\n","<P>20    people in these towns did we take part in?\n","<P>21       A.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have\n","<P>22    had anything to do with any such thing.\n","<P>23            First of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What\n","<P>24    the confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of\n","<P>25    civilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    unlawful, and there were such cases.\n","<P> 2            Now, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of\n","<P> 3    all, there were individual instances in some of these places through the\n","<P> 4    self-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance\n","<P> 5    of Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.\n","<P> 6    And then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of\n","<P> 7    their own because they couldn't influence him.  He appeared as a factor,\n","<P> 8    and there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his\n","<P> 9    motives were of a criminal nature.\n","<P>10            There were other such cases in some of these places whereby\n","<P>11    somebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in\n","<P>12    order to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive\n","<P>13    money and then release them once they received money for that.  There were\n","<P>14    also instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,\n","<P>15    somebody's family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or\n","<P>16    Croats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often\n","<P>17    were not able to prevent revenge of that kind.\n","<P>18       Q.   Which authorities?\n","<P>19       A.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.\n","<P>20       Q.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian\n","<P>21    authorities intervene?\n","<P>22       A.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn't influence or involve\n","<P>23    themselves in any such matters.\n","<P>24            So as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one\n","<P>25    should take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    those cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and\n","<P> 2    what the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.\n","<P> 3            Now, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places\n","<P> 4    where possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of\n","<P> 5    context and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse\n","<P> 6    top-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian\n","<P> 7    Yugoslavia as well.\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has\n","<P> 9    become a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you\n","<P>10    say that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing\n","<P>11    like the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged\n","<P>12    by the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn't understand me correctly,\n","<P>14    Mr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,\n","<P>15    but there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top\n","<P>16    echelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely\n","<P>17    impossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like\n","<P>18    that, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is\n","<P>19    impossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such\n","<P>20    thing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did\n","<P>21    commit crimes.  And it wasn't only individuals who committed crimes.\n","<P>22    There was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.\n","<P>23    And I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my\n","<P>24    information, but I can't be well-versed in everything, but I can in\n","<P>25    basics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    wasn't the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit\n","<P> 2    crimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn't the policy of the\n","<P> 3    leadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.\n","<P> 4            Now, --\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn't the policy of this accused in\n","<P> 6    concert with other --\n","<P> 7            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of\n","<P> 8    Mr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,\n","<P> 9    continuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such\n","<P>10    crimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the\n","<P>11    most serious form of war crimes.\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>14       Q.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There's an enormous\n","<P>15    list of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,\n","<P>16    and the subject here is deportation.\n","<P>17            Now, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let's clarify that.  Albeit in\n","<P>18    Serbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,\n","<P>19    Muslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\n","<P>20    70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle\n","<P>21    of non-discrimination like anybody else.\n","<P>22            Now, I can't clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is\n","<P>23    being accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it\n","<P>24    stated here -- it says:  \"Milosevic, acting alone or together with other\n","<P>25    members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or\n","<P> 2    execution of the unlawful forcible transfer...\"\n","<P> 3            Now, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic\n","<P> 4    of Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or\n","<P> 5    unlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful\n","<P> 6    movement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one\n","<P> 7    individual?\n","<P> 8       A.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with\n","<P> 9    anything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these\n","<P>10    phenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what\n","<P>11    did happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group\n","<P>12    to leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that\n","<P>13    desire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were\n","<P>14    instances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,\n","<P>15    that people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,\n","<P>16    something afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind\n","<P>17    what had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to\n","<P>18    move out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or\n","<P>19    perhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they\n","<P>20    were the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and\n","<P>21    in some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established\n","<P>22    in some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete\n","<P>23    example, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from\n","<P>24    Prijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a\n","<P>25    convoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I'm stopping you because you have\n","<P> 2    answered the question.  You are becoming a little too expansive.\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think that this would be very\n","<P> 4    important.\n","<P> 5            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 6       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what example do you know of personally?\n","<P> 7       A.   I'm talking about one example when Muslims were transported\n","<P> 8    because they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And\n","<P> 9    then the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose\n","<P>10    name is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is\n","<P>11    called Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large\n","<P>12    group of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the\n","<P>13    authorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part\n","<P>14    of Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army\n","<P>15    of Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.\n","<P>16            Then he tried to explain this in a completely different way:\n","<P>17    Somebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he's\n","<P>18    trying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.\n","<P>19            Such people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,\n","<P>20    entered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and\n","<P>21    then they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed\n","<P>22    although they are invariably false because --\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm stopping you.  Mr. Seselj, no doubt you're a\n","<P>24    man of many virtues.  Is omniscience one of them?  How do you happen to\n","<P>25    know all these things?  I have to ask myself that question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson --\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Where is your knowledge coming from?\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, all my life I have\n","<P> 4    been learning, learning, learning, and constantly learning.  Even now in\n","<P> 5    prison I read eight to ten hours a day, although the conditions under\n","<P> 6    which I live are very poor because they want to prevent me from preparing\n","<P> 7    my defence case properly.  But I'm a constant learner, and I wish others\n","<P> 8    were too.\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  It would help my appreciation of your evidence if\n","<P>10    only occasionally we were told of the basis for the information that you\n","<P>11    have about specific matters.\n","<P>12            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of\n","<P>15    Serbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and\n","<P>16    that as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon\n","<P>17    what do you base this statement?\n","<P>18       A.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I\n","<P>19    base my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent\n","<P>20    statements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.\n","<P>21            Secondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.\n","<P>22    They never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never\n","<P>23    discriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the\n","<P>24    authorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in\n","<P>25    Bosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    and treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.\n","<P> 2            So there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic\n","<P> 3    whatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution\n","<P> 4    of Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in\n","<P> 5    Serbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal\n","<P> 6    of money.  Perhaps not all of them were happy with what they got, but this\n","<P> 7    involved major expenditure on the part of the state.\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  But did the authorities of Serbia allow\n","<P> 9    discrimination over any Muslim Croat or the member of any other ethnic\n","<P>10    group in Serbia during the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia?\n","<P>11       A.   No.  Even if there were any incidents on ethnic grounds, the\n","<P>12    authorities acted in accordance with the law and brought such matters to\n","<P>13    trial.  They simply did not allow things like that to happen.\n","<P>14       Q.   Please look at paragraph 42 now.  Again it says here:  \"Slobodan\n","<P>15    Milosevic,\" and so on and so forth, on or about the 1st of March, 1992,\n","<P>16    until 391st of December, 1995, acting alone or in concert with members of\n","<P>17    the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or\n","<P>18    otherwise aided and abetted the planning preparation or execution of\n","<P>19    wanton destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the\n","<P>20    Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations and then\" --\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, too fast.  Too fast.\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>23       Q.   So I, Mr. Seselj, according to this paragraph 42, aided and\n","<P>24    abetted the planning, preparation or execution, I executed this.  It\n","<P>25    wasn't that I only aided and abetted others, but I committed wanton\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the Bosnian\n","<P> 2    Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations, and again all these\n","<P> 3    municipalities are listed here where I committed wanton looting of\n","<P> 4    property belonging to Muslims and Croats.\n","<P> 5            Please tell us not only what you know about this but also on the\n","<P> 6    basis of what you know what you know.\n","<P> 7       A.   This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in\n","<P> 8    any way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of\n","<P> 9    private and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three\n","<P>10    sides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything\n","<P>11    under control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.\n","<P>12            What happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims\n","<P>13    would loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have\n","<P>14    their own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar\n","<P>15    way in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no\n","<P>16    official authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No\n","<P>17    one personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,\n","<P>18    et cetera.\n","<P>19            There were paramilitary formations that had looting as their\n","<P>20    primary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also\n","<P>21    from Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People\n","<P>22    travelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize\n","<P>23    their car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were\n","<P>24    such cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial\n","<P>25    Chamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    looting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions\n","<P> 2    that were rather chaotic.\n","<P> 3            There was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.\n","<P> 4    Not only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika\n","<P> 5    Srpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in\n","<P> 7    a military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto\n","<P> 8    civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and\n","<P> 9    wounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.\n","<P>10            You were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please\n","<P>11    explain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,\n","<P>12    tell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.\n","<P>14       A.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a\n","<P>15    dissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict\n","<P>16    in Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of\n","<P>17    the duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case\n","<P>18    elsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on\n","<P>19    both sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less\n","<P>20    casualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what\n","<P>21    Judge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I\n","<P>22    read.\n","<P>23            I was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the\n","<P>24    killing of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted\n","<P>25    intentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Muslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present\n","<P> 2    this in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,\n","<P> 3    Vasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not\n","<P> 4    take part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official\n","<P> 5    factors from Serbia, that is.\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.  On the transcript it's a double\n","<P> 7    negative.\n","<P> 8            Yes, Mr. --\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] There is a double negative in the\n","<P>10    Serbian language and it does not change the meaning of the statement.  In\n","<P>11    English it might mean something different.  I'm sorry I don't know English\n","<P>12    and I cannot really adjust to this.\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or\n","<P>15    deny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took\n","<P>16    part in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you\n","<P>17    confirm that?\n","<P>18       A.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.\n","<P>19       Q.   All right.  Thank you.\n","<P>20       A.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The\n","<P>21    Muslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the\n","<P>22    liberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.\n","<P>23       Q.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his\n","<P>24    witness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,\n","<P>25    including women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only\n","<P> 2    logical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee\n","<P> 3    from war.  They're fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.\n","<P> 4            Very often in this war and in any other war civilians would get\n","<P> 5    killed by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from\n","<P> 6    the conflict.\n","<P> 7       Q.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the\n","<P> 8    Serbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it's supposed\n","<P> 9    to seem?\n","<P>10       A.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray\n","<P>11    this, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their\n","<P>12    victims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We\n","<P>13    are faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is\n","<P>14    based and anti-Serb grounds.\n","<P>15       Q.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings\n","<P>16    happened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all\n","<P>17    of that can be found here in this indictment that I've been quoting to\n","<P>18    you, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to\n","<P>20    give.  Ask another question.\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a\n","<P>22    question to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that\n","<P>23    he can give an answer.  He's a politician, an intellectual, a university\n","<P>24    professor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,\n","<P>25    and he is in a position to give an answer to this question.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And I've already ruled that he is not to answer\n","<P> 2    it.  So proceed.\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 5       Q.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the\n","<P> 6    JNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know\n","<P> 7    about that?  This is on transcript page 20408.\n","<P> 8       A.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The\n","<P> 9    two sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the\n","<P>10    bridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric\n","<P>11    power plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to\n","<P>12    destroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old\n","<P>13    hydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the\n","<P>14    paramilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The\n","<P>15    conflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can't say exactly, I\n","<P>16    wasn't there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And\n","<P>17    then also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.\n","<P>18       Q.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units\n","<P>19    committed crimes in Zvornik.\n","<P>20       A.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there\n","<P>21    that can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but\n","<P>22    who it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are\n","<P>23    ascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to\n","<P>24    Karadzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.\n","<P>25            In Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    people for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 4       Q.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing\n","<P> 5    them, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They\n","<P> 6    are mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided\n","<P> 7    by Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,\n","<P> 8    Drinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you\n","<P> 9    heard anything about this and what do you know about it?\n","<P>10       A.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my\n","<P>11    knowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but\n","<P>12    once the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very\n","<P>13    simply, who the victims were and who the executors were.\n","<P>14       Q.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the\n","<P>15    cultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many\n","<P>16    persons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force\n","<P>17    there is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I'll just go\n","<P>18    on.\n","<P>19       A.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were\n","<P>20    committed.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn't the JNA that\n","<P>21    took part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take\n","<P>22    part in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully\n","<P>23    investigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims\n","<P>24    are still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether\n","<P>25    there was enough will to investigate this matter, and I've already\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    referred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect\n","<P> 2    a great deal from that.\n","<P> 3       Q.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I don't know anything about it.  I wasn't there.\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj and Mr. Milosevic, you are not\n","<P> 6    observing the pause between question and answer, and you are thereby\n","<P> 7    creating difficulties for the interpreter.\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, this is the first time\n","<P> 9    you have warned us about this today.  As you see, Mr. Seselj and I are\n","<P>10    bearing this in mind.\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We're practising.\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment\n","<P>14    in this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your\n","<P>15    units.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan's men.  Do\n","<P>16    you have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your\n","<P>17    units were there?  You've already explained you didn't have any units of\n","<P>18    yours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers\n","<P>19    were there?\n","<P>20       A.   I'm not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik\n","<P>21    area.  I know that Arkan's Tigers were active there but to what extent and\n","<P>22    in what locations I couldn't say because I wasn't there.\n","<P>23            All the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I\n","<P>24    do not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and\n","<P>25    misfortunes he talked about, but evidently he's very confused when\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    identifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He's mixing up Seselj's\n","<P> 2    men, the White Eagles, Arkan's men, and this shows that he's very confused\n","<P> 3    and unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers\n","<P> 4    of the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to\n","<P> 5    everything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very\n","<P> 6    often it's beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn't be easy to\n","<P> 7    establish who actually perpetrated this.\n","<P> 8       Q.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a\n","<P> 9    certain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the\n","<P>10    transcript.  Do you know anything about this?\n","<P>11       A.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","<P>12    committed any crimes in that place.\n","<P>13       Q.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb\n","<P>14    Radical Party?\n","<P>15       A.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party\n","<P>16    sent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,\n","<P>17    and as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me\n","<P>18    had any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I'm sure of it.\n","<P>19       Q.   Would other volunteers have reported this?\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and\n","<P>21    they would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,\n","<P>22    because this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about\n","<P>24    the conducts of the volunteers?\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn't say the reports were\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    regular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out\n","<P> 2    how the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All\n","<P> 3    the problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of\n","<P> 4    indiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers\n","<P> 5    to be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline\n","<P> 6    of the other men.\n","<P> 7            I was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the\n","<P> 8    conclusion that none occurred.\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral\n","<P>11    conversations.\n","<P>12            I'm convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written\n","<P>13    reports would have been sent to me.  I'm sure that the competent command\n","<P>14    would have told me had something like this happened.\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>16            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>17       Q.   Mr. Seselj, if you can't recall it doesn't matter, but is it true\n","<P>18    that in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,\n","<P>19    1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of\n","<P>20    Seselj's men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?\n","<P>21       A.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj's men, then\n","<P>22    should be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell\n","<P>23    you whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group\n","<P>24    of Seselj's men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he's\n","<P>25    the leader if they don't know his name?  What does the term \"leader\" mean?\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Was he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times\n","<P> 2    that volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in\n","<P> 3    units larger than a company.\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I\n","<P> 6    have a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I\n","<P> 7    wanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the\n","<P> 8    indictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no\n","<P> 9    such instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","<P>10    Party.\n","<P>11            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>13       Q.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such\n","<P>14    instances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various\n","<P>15    allegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of\n","<P>16    time.\n","<P>17            Please tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about\n","<P>18    the events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men\n","<P>19    participated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\n","<P>20       A.   First of all --\n","<P>21            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is that reference?\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I quoted about half an hour ago, but\n","<P>23    it wasn't sufficiently clear.  I will try to find it again.  I'm simply\n","<P>24    trying to establish whether the witness knows anything about\n","<P>25    Bosanski Samac.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have some knowledge but --\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  The answer -- the question I have is --  what do\n","<P> 3    you mean by \"because it says,\" it says, \"that your men participated in\n","<P> 4    taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\"  What is \"it\"?\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj something about\n","<P> 6    Samac before, but right now I can't find it.\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  I take it it's not another reference to the\n","<P> 8    indictment against Mr. Seselj.\n","<P> 9            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I don't think it is.\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have Bosanski Samac mentioned in\n","<P>11    several places on your indictment, if I can be of assistance, and I can\n","<P>12    tell you what I know about the events in Bosanski Samac.\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>14       Q.   Well, that's the only reason I asked you whether you knew\n","<P>15    anything.\n","<P>16       A.   In paragraph 42 Bosanski Samac is ascribed to you.\n","<P>17       Q.   Well, all the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are\n","<P>18    ascribed to me.  There aren't any which are not ascribed to me.  But what\n","<P>19    do you know about the events there?\n","<P>20            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I don't understand this question.  You\n","<P>21    can't just ask a question, take a municipality and say, \"What do you know\n","<P>22    about events there?\"  There's got to be some point to the question.\n","<P>23            Now, what is this dealing with?\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>25       Q.   Very well.  I won't ask you anything about that, then, because I\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    can't find the reference now.\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, Mr. Milosevic.  If you find the\n","<P> 3    reference, you can come back to it, but bear in mind that you undertook to\n","<P> 4    complete the evidence in chief today.\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I'm doing my best, Mr. Robinson, but\n","<P> 6    there are many, many witnesses who mentioned Mr. Seselj, and I want to see\n","<P> 7    whether there's any truth in anything they said.\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, you may -- Mr. Milosevic, you may have\n","<P> 9    other witnesses who may be in a better position to contradict the\n","<P>10    assertions in the Prosecution case than Mr. Seselj himself.  Don't assume\n","<P>11    that because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he's the\n","<P>12    best person to contradict it.\n","<P>13            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>15       Q.   On page 23520 of the transcript.  I'll skip over the witness's\n","<P>16    name because I can't recall at present whether or not he was protected,\n","<P>17    Mr. Robinson.  I don't think he was, because I don't have any note to that\n","<P>18    effect, but he says:  \"In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the\n","<P>19    White Wolves, and the JNA participated.\"\n","<P>20            Do you know anything about this?\n","<P>21       A.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,\n","<P>22    there was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from\n","<P>23    Eastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the\n","<P>24    indictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.\n","<P>25    His name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    helicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was\n","<P> 2    accompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","<P> 3    Party, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for\n","<P> 4    sure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also\n","<P> 5    Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as\n","<P> 6    the Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was\n","<P> 7    charged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in\n","<P> 8    Banja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical\n","<P> 9    Party.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and\n","<P>10    the party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.\n","<P>11       Q.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don't know that Kragujevac\n","<P>12    is not in Bosnia.\n","<P>13       A.   That's correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I'm getting ready\n","<P>14    to obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was\n","<P>15    expelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan\n","<P>16    Savic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the\n","<P>17    Serb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave\n","<P>18    my legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial\n","<P>19    and all the accompanying materials.\n","<P>20            As for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to\n","<P>21    me certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man\n","<P>22    Radovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his\n","<P>23    participation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.\n","<P>24            Those are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members\n","<P>25    of the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    had previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even\n","<P> 2    called him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was\n","<P> 3    Srecko Radovanovic.\n","<P> 4            There was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was\n","<P> 5    certainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was\n","<P> 6    certainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been\n","<P> 7    he would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that\n","<P> 8    unit was called the Grey Wolves.\n","<P> 9            JUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I've understood\n","<P>10    from that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions\n","<P>11    in Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you've said?\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,\n","<P>13    yes.\n","<P>14            JUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called\n","<P>15    the Grey Wolves active there?\n","<P>16            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it's very problematic to say\n","<P>17    paramilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means\n","<P>18    outside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial\n","<P>19    Defence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I'm not\n","<P>20    sure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,\n","<P>21    I think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good\n","<P>22    fighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what\n","<P>23    happened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called\n","<P>24    Crkvina or something like that.  I can't recall it all off the top of my\n","<P>25    head, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Banja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven't dealt with.  Did\n","<P> 3    they participate?\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What\n","<P> 5    Red Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?\n","<P> 6            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's a perfectly legitimate answer for you to\n","<P> 7    give, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the\n","<P> 8    Red Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the\n","<P> 9    quotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,\n","<P>10    which on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they've got\n","<P>11    nothing to do with the question.  So all I'm doing now is trying to find\n","<P>12    out what the real answer to that question is.\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the\n","<P>15    Red Berets.\n","<P>16                          --- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.\n","<P>17                          --- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the\n","<P>19    technical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary\n","<P>20    resulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected\n","<P>21    witness.\n","<P>22            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>23            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>25       Q.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Wolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also\n","<P> 2    mentioned.  Now, the witness, I don't know whether he was protected or\n","<P> 3    not, I don't want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the\n","<P> 4    transcript says that he saw 20 locals, and it's about Samac, wearing\n","<P> 5    uniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed\n","<P> 6    they were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned\n","<P> 7    to Samac.  Do you know anything about that?\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, I don't have any information to that effect, and that is\n","<P> 9    quite impossible.  I'd like to point out once again that in different\n","<P>10    places they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had\n","<P>11    found some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have\n","<P>12    been various units, especially as we're talking about locals in this\n","<P>13    particular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What\n","<P>14    does it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some\n","<P>15    warehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they\n","<P>16    were some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the\n","<P>17    Red Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of\n","<P>18    the State Security in 1996.\n","<P>19            So quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term\n","<P>20    applies to different concepts.\n","<P>21       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I\n","<P>22    think that is in the indictment against you but you'll put me right if I'm\n","<P>23    wrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,\n","<P>24    that is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,\n","<P>25    wherein amongst others you said:  \"Dear brother Chetniks, especially you\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    across the Drina, you're the bravest, and we're going to clear up Bosnia\n","<P> 2    from the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong.\"  Is\n","<P> 3    it true that you said that?\n","<P> 4       A.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and\n","<P> 5    partially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,\n","<P> 6    because -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don't always know\n","<P> 7    the Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an\n","<P> 8    artificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the\n","<P> 9    Croats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian\n","<P>10    variation \"pogan\" means \"pagan,\" where as in the Serb language \"pogan\"\n","<P>11    means \"waste\" or \"faeces.\"  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and\n","<P>12    pan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called\n","<P>13    them \"pogani,\" which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the\n","<P>14    Muslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I'm not a stupid\n","<P>15    man.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have\n","<P>16    nothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more\n","<P>17    than I do to all the Christians afterwards, let's make that point clear,\n","<P>18    but I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --\n","<P>19    greatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims\n","<P>20    to be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.\n","<P>21            So here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion\n","<P>22    is being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,\n","<P>23    and I've been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,\n","<P>24    Islamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they\n","<P>25    first appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.  Well, if you\n","<P> 4    haven't got if it in my books then the Prosecution probably has a copy\n","<P> 5    because most of my speeches were published in my books, in my works so, if\n","<P> 6    a speech does not happen to be there, if --\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  Was this one published in your books?  I apologise.\n","<P> 8    I haven't read them all.\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson [sic], two years ago I\n","<P>10    handed over to The Hague Tribunal 80 of my printed works.\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  Is this speech in any of them?\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Most probably, but it would be up to\n","<P>13    the Prosecution to find it, not me.  I can't look through that whole\n","<P>14    matter myself, because I didn't make the statement only in one place.  I\n","<P>15    made the statement in several places, on several occasions.\n","<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  Well, normally the party presenting the evidence is\n","<P>17    responsible for getting it to court in some -- as official as is possible,\n","<P>18    but you're not aware of a copy of it being available for us as part of the\n","<P>19    papers in connection with your evidence.\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Bonomy, the side that has\n","<P>21    referred to my alleged speech is the Prosecution's side.  So I'm just\n","<P>22    telling you where they made a mistake.  So they can find the original of\n","<P>23    the speech and present it here.  I can't do the work of the Prosecution.\n","<P>24    I can't be expected to do that.  I am testifying to the facts and\n","<P>25    circumstances about which I have knowledge.  I'm not here to help the\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Prosecution out in its work.  And for my part, I have contributed\n","<P> 2    sufficiently by handing over all my books.  They have far greater\n","<P> 3    resources than I do.\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Nice, can you help?  Where do I locate the\n","<P> 5    evidence, readily locate the evidence in relation to this?\n","<P> 6            MR. NICE:  I'm not sure you can locate it readily at the moment\n","<P> 7    from our own database.  It may be possible.\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  It appears Mr. Seselj is suggesting that there is\n","<P> 9    evidence of this speech led by the Prosecution in this case.\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  It may be in this case or it may be in the pre-trial\n","<P>11    brief of his own case.  I'll deal with it as soon as I can.\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  All right.  Thank you.\n","<P>13            MR. NICE:  We can't of course be guided in the way we are going to\n","<P>14    present our questions through his observations.  We'll make our own\n","<P>15    decisions.\n","<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  No, no, no.  That's nothing to the point.  I'm just\n","<P>17    trying to clarify where I can read this speech, but if no one's going to\n","<P>18    help me, that's okay.\n","<P>19            MR. NICE:  We certainly will help you when we can.\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>22       Q.   Witness B1643 who testified pursuant to 92 bis, I assume you know\n","<P>23    the written part, mentioned torture and capture of civilians in the SUP\n","<P>24    building of the Territorial Defence in the primary school and secondary\n","<P>25    school in Crkvina, the warehouse there.  Do you know anything about that?\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, I already mentioned something about this.  I said that the\n","<P> 2    Crkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey\n","<P> 3    Wolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was\n","<P> 4    arrested, but I don't have any details about how the trial proceeded and\n","<P> 5    the upshot.  I asked my legal advisors to find the complete dossier of\n","<P> 6    that trial, but I do know for certain that he was arrested and taken to\n","<P> 7    trial in Banja Luka, prosecuted in Banja Luka.\n","<P> 8       Q.   The indictment against you, in the indictment you are accused of\n","<P> 9    an act on the 7th of May, 1992, which allegedly happened there which says\n","<P>10    that two leaders of your group under your command killed 18 males at the\n","<P>11    agricultural farm in Crkvina.  Is that the event you are referring to?\n","<P>12       A.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn't there\n","<P>13    nor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical\n","<P>14    Party.\n","<P>15       Q.   That's all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your\n","<P>16    answer suffices.\n","<P>17            You are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when\n","<P>18    allegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated\n","<P>19    killed 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating\n","<P>21    on the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was\n","<P>23    quoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.\n","<P>24    So it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this\n","<P>25    question of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    concept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he\n","<P> 2    stands accused, because he's testifying here.\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily\n","<P> 4    relevant for that purpose.\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I'm not going to\n","<P> 6    insist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.\n","<P> 7            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 8       Q.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993\n","<P> 9    some members of your alleged --\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have\n","<P>11    continued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not\n","<P>12    see at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial\n","<P>13    here.  I know that he's alleged to be a member of the joint criminal\n","<P>14    enterprise.  I'm well aware of that.  But that doesn't let in any and all\n","<P>15    kind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.\n","<P>16            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see\n","<P>17    here that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,\n","<P>18    then that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren't true\n","<P>19    either, and he has refuted a number of witnesses' statements here that I\n","<P>20    quoted.\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know\n","<P>22    you know that.\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, witness William Thomas Francis Roy on page 28882 of\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the transcript stated here that the Muslim snipers killed three pregnant\n","<P> 2    women and only then did the Serb snipers respond by opening fire.  Do you\n","<P> 3    know anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked\n","<P> 4    to killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire\n","<P> 6    in Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front\n","<P> 7    line stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part\n","<P> 8    under Muslim control and another part under Serb control.\n","<P> 9            Now, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind\n","<P>10    the following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from\n","<P>11    rifles which wasn't a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because\n","<P>12    sniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with\n","<P>13    optic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the\n","<P>14    Serb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to\n","<P>15    come by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black\n","<P>16    market.  I don't exclude the possibility of individual cases there being\n","<P>17    the need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was\n","<P>18    opened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain\n","<P>19    control of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two\n","<P>20    sides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn't\n","<P>21    change for many years, and one or the other side would take control of\n","<P>22    certain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.\n","<P>23            On the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional\n","<P>24    killing of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims\n","<P>25    killed about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    in Kazani and so on.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the\n","<P> 3    Sarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present\n","<P> 4    on both sides.  Is that true?\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in\n","<P> 6    Sarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The\n","<P> 7    real snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far\n","<P> 8    more than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more\n","<P> 9    sophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more\n","<P>10    favourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I've forgotten the evidence which I\n","<P>12    think there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How\n","<P>13    much personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the\n","<P>14    conflict there.\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to\n","<P>16    the Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that\n","<P>17    is.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.\n","<P>18    At Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and\n","<P>19    I met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh\n","<P>20    shipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my\n","<P>21    colleagues from university and also people whom I'd been to school with,\n","<P>22    Muslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.\n","<P>23            JUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire\n","<P>24    going on?\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    stay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some\n","<P> 2    dangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you\n","<P> 3    had to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but\n","<P> 4    there were no more serious conflicts at that time.\n","<P> 5            JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 7       Q.   Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,\n","<P> 8    referred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on\n","<P> 9    page 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs\n","<P>10    fired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in\n","<P>11    Sarajevo?\n","<P>12       A.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open\n","<P>13    fire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be\n","<P>14    ascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused\n","<P>15    protected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction\n","<P>16    from the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo\n","<P>17    they would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at\n","<P>18    Serb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off\n","<P>19    in the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,\n","<P>20    then they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at\n","<P>21    hospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,\n","<P>22    who were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the\n","<P>23    hospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw\n","<P>24    quickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived\n","<P>25    they didn't come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    fire in retaliation.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited\n","<P> 3    Bijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --\n","<P> 4    page 8258 of Alija Gusalic's -- 18258, and I link this up with your\n","<P> 5    indictment and Alija Gusalic's testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina\n","<P> 6    and members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to\n","<P> 7    takeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?\n","<P> 8       A.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite\n","<P> 9    correct.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just\n","<P>10    nonsense.\n","<P>11       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there\n","<P>12    were Arkan's men and Seselj's men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything\n","<P>13    about that?\n","<P>14       A.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb\n","<P>15    Radical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I'm absolutely certain\n","<P>16    of that.\n","<P>17       Q.   The same witness says on page 18260, \"Seselj's men had beards and\n","<P>18    cockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to\n","<P>19    distribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party.\"\n","<P>20       A.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb\n","<P>21    Radical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly\n","<P>22    clean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not\n","<P>23    bring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot\n","<P>24    be synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for\n","<P>25    ideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    not a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier\n","<P> 2    having a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not\n","<P> 3    distribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role\n","<P> 4    in these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.\n","<P> 5            Members of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but\n","<P> 6    exclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.\n","<P> 7       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now\n","<P> 8    I'm asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were\n","<P> 9    not Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were\n","<P>10    held at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you\n","<P>11    know anything about that?\n","<P>12       A.   I don't know about those particular localities, but I've already\n","<P>13    talked about Mauzer's and Arkan's conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for\n","<P>14    that reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often\n","<P>15    attacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.\n","<P>16       Q.   I'm sorry that I didn't draw your attention to this on time,\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you\n","<P>18    are being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in\n","<P>19    Batkovic.\n","<P>20       A.   I've already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb\n","<P>21    Radical Party there.\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic\n","<P>24    testified here, and he made those assertions here, and I'm linking that up\n","<P>25    with --\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness\n","<P> 2    made the allegations here.\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp\n","<P> 4    near Bijeljina.  And I've linked that up to what the indictment against\n","<P> 5    Mr. Seselj says.\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that's not relevant.  Move on.\n","<P> 7            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused\n","<P> 9    Mr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a\n","<P>10    hundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?\n","<P>11            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it's not relevant to\n","<P>13    this case.\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the\n","<P>15    basis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks\n","<P>16    about Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj's indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane\n","<P>18    treatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in\n","<P>19    Seselj's indictment?\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the\n","<P>23    International Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything\n","<P>24    about this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?\n","<P>25       A.   I don't know anything about the visit of the International Red\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Cross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.\n","<P> 2    Also, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of\n","<P> 3    prisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not\n","<P> 4    take part in any such thing.\n","<P> 5            As for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and\n","<P> 6    if there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would\n","<P> 7    have to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right.  I'm not going to ask you about this anymore.  You\n","<P> 9    mentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is\n","<P>10    that right?\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the\n","<P>13    activity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the\n","<P>14    situation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,\n","<P>15    do you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?\n","<P>16       A.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no\n","<P>17    paramilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in\n","<P>18    Mostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,\n","<P>19    from the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical\n","<P>20    Party were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them\n","<P>21    as highly disciplined on Belgrade television.\n","<P>22            If there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have\n","<P>23    been members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention\n","<P>24    platoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not\n","<P>25    preclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    was not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp\n","<P> 3    there were Seselj's Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;\n","<P> 4    transcript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?\n","<P> 5       A.   That is absolutely impossible.  I've never heard of the White\n","<P> 6    Eagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven't heard of this Buna\n","<P> 7    camp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","<P> 8    Party, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared\n","<P> 9    in Buna.  I don't know anything about this, but there should be proper\n","<P>10    records to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White\n","<P>11    Eagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any\n","<P>12    Red Berets.\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in\n","<P>14    Nevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?\n","<P>15       A.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I\n","<P>16    was in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and\n","<P>17    in the Neretva valley.\n","<P>18       Q.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?\n","<P>19       A.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in\n","<P>20    Nevesinje.\n","<P>21       Q.   That will do.\n","<P>22       A.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable\n","<P>23    number of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no\n","<P>24    conflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large\n","<P>25    number of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    were put up at various facilities there.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Do you know anything about a lake, Boracko Jezero, and a rest\n","<P> 3    house there where about 19 persons were killed, according to the\n","<P> 4    allegations made?\n","<P> 5       A.   I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers\n","<P> 6    of the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That's close to\n","<P> 7    Konjic.  I've already said that there were members of the Serb guard\n","<P> 8    there.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was\n","<P> 9    there, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was\n","<P>10    operating.\n","<P>11       Q.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan's Serb\n","<P>12    volunteer guard?\n","<P>13       A.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.\n","<P>14       Q.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?\n","<P>15       A.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared\n","<P>16    elsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities\n","<P>17    had a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because\n","<P>18    they stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then\n","<P>19    they appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a\n","<P>20    lot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic's.  As far as I\n","<P>21    know, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj --\n","<P>23       A.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav\n","<P>24    Lajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.\n","<P>25       Q.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   The Serb guard.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Of Vuk Draskovic?\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from\n","<P> 4    Novi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made\n","<P> 6    to the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.  I've forgotten\n","<P> 7    his first name.\n","<P> 8       A.   Jovan.\n","<P> 9       Q.   Jovan Dulovic who testified here.  Mr. Robinson instructed me to\n","<P>10    find the original documents that can be linked up to your submissions\n","<P>11    since they refused to admit your submissions.\n","<P>12            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I am sorry, Mr. Robinson.  If you're\n","<P>13    telling me to have copies made I will do that, but I've just received\n","<P>14    these copies.  This is a series of photocopies of articles written by\n","<P>15    Jovan Dulovic and published in Ekspres Politika from the 16th of November,\n","<P>16    the 26th of November, all of that in 1991.  Then the 18th of November, the\n","<P>17    2nd of November.  So from November 1991.\n","<P>18            In these articles, he speaks very favourably of the JNA and\n","<P>19    commends their behaviour in the fighting around Vukovar.  For example, he\n","<P>20    says that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats, saw the light of\n","<P>21    the day after having stayed in cellars for many --\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, what is the question?\n","<P>23            MR. NICE:  And, Your Honour, if I may interrupt, if there's going\n","<P>24    to be a reference to and quotation from a newspaper article, it has to be\n","<P>25    on the overhead projector.  It then has to be available to us to read it\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    in full should we wish to.\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's -- that's the practice, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, since I have only one copy of these articles and I've\n","<P> 6    just received that, could the usher please place them on the ELMO, and\n","<P> 7    then you can have a look at least at some of the parts that have been\n","<P> 8    marked.  Reference is made to Major Sljivancanin here, too, in a very\n","<P> 9    favourable light.  Gratitude for assistance to civilians, Croats, at that,\n","<P>10    and so on and so forth.  Please look at this series of articles.\n","<P>11            In order to answer my question, are these at least partly articles\n","<P>12    that you relied on when you wrote those submissions to the other side\n","<P>13    about the untruthful testimony of Jovan Dulovic or, rather, the difference\n","<P>14    in -- between his reporting then and his testimony here about Vukovar?\n","<P>15            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, that was a leading but nevertheless it's\n","<P>16    interesting to see what the articles actually say.  And if it becomes\n","<P>17    relevant to consider their admissibility as evidence, I know the Chamber\n","<P>18    will have in mind its open recent ruling in respect of the documents of\n","<P>19    Jasovic and the potential evidential value or not as evidence of these\n","<P>20    documents, but I'm most interested frankly in seeing what they actually\n","<P>21    say.\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let's get it on the overhead projector.\n","<P>23            There appears to be a technical problem.  We're not seeing\n","<P>24    anything.\n","<P>25            Mr. Milosevic, the technician is being called.  He's coming in.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    So move on to another question.  We'll come back to this.\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am sorry, but my\n","<P> 3    next question also has to do with something that Mr. Seselj already\n","<P> 4    testified about and the document that I obtained in the meantime and that\n","<P> 5    would also have to be placed on the ELMO.  That is --\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,\n","<P> 7    because the overhead projector is not working.\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further\n","<P> 9    questions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except\n","<P>10    for this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a\n","<P>11    decision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were\n","<P>12    presented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal\n","<P>13    government said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was\n","<P>14    known who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.\n","<P>15    The 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.  So it is about\n","<P>16    40 days after the coup d'etat of the 5th of October, 2000.  It was then\n","<P>17    that they were all released, set free.\n","<P>18            So wanted to show you this document, and I wanted to hand out\n","<P>19    copies to you.  I've just received this.  They are all in the Serbian\n","<P>20    language but they can be placed on the ELMO to show what the government\n","<P>21    spokesman had said was completely disregarded, and these persons mentioned\n","<P>22    in the criminal report against Erdemovic were set free.\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The ELMO is working now, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please take a look at this.  This is a series of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    articles from Ekspres Politika.  Can you see the date of the newspaper?\n","<P> 2       A.   It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of\n","<P> 3    November.\n","<P> 4       Q.   1991; right?\n","<P> 5       A.   1991.\n","<P> 6       Q.   Unless this is a leading question.\n","<P> 7       A.   It's illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one\n","<P> 8    of the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when\n","<P> 9    preparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.\n","<P>10    That is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of\n","<P>11    Evidence and Procedure.\n","<P>12       Q.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the\n","<P>13    subheading?\n","<P>14       A.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both\n","<P>15    Serbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars\n","<P>16    for a long time.  \"Light finally,\" is the heading.  And then in the\n","<P>17    subheading:  \"Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas.\"  And then there's\n","<P>18    another bit saying, \"In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,\"\n","<P>19    and then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, \"I cannot believe\n","<P>20    that we are alive,\" and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated\n","<P>21    the town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.\n","<P>22            THE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of\n","<P>23    the question was not heard by the interpreters.\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.  The interpreters have\n","<P>25    indicated that you're overlapping and so she did not hear the beginning of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the last question.  Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P> 2            And please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 4       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.\n","<P> 5    Perhaps it's easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text\n","<P> 6    is.\n","<P> 7       A.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as\n","<P> 8    follows:  \"A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total\n","<P> 9    of 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity.\"\n","<P>10    That's what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and\n","<P>11    Croats equally.  Civilians, that is.\n","<P>12            I can't read the first paragraph because it's quite illegible, but\n","<P>13    it seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,\n","<P>14    that several ambulances were waiting to help.  \"It would not be a good\n","<P>15    thing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now.\"\n","<P>16            So Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of\n","<P>17    Vukovar before the fighting had stopped.\n","<P>18       Q.   Can you see the subtitle which says \"The cruel major\"?\n","<P>19       A.   Yes.\n","<P>20       Q.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this\n","<P>21    refers to and what it says about this cruel major.\n","<P>22       A.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians\n","<P>23    very nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that\n","<P>24    surprised this Croat woman, and he says:  \"No knows what she as a Croat\n","<P>25    heard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers.\"  So he's describing the\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    behaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what\n","<P> 2    Croatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very\n","<P> 3    bad way.\n","<P> 4            And then Major Sljivancanin says:  \"Whenever you need anything,\n","<P> 5    look for me and I'll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to\n","<P> 6    go, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full\n","<P> 7    of gratitude.\"  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  \"He had\n","<P> 8    followed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude.\"\n","<P> 9            All this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now\n","<P>10    Colonel Veselin Sljivancanin.\n","<P>11       Q.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic\n","<P>12    describes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, \"Take this\n","<P>13    child to hospital immediately.\"\n","<P>14       A.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, \"Take this child to the\n","<P>15    hospital in Negoslavci right away,\" Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing\n","<P>16    the ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  \"Let her be given\n","<P>17    assistance and medicine.\"\n","<P>18            A little later Vlatka's mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for\n","<P>19    her daughter in the crowd.  \"Where is my child?  What have they done to\n","<P>20    her?  Where have they taken her,\" Verica was crying out.\n","<P>21            \"Don't be afraid.  She is in hospital,\" Sljivancanin said.  The\n","<P>22    frightened woman didn't believe it.\"  This is followed by Dulovic's\n","<P>23    comment:  \"Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA\n","<P>24    soldiers.\"\n","<P>25       Q.   And what does it say then?\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   \"Get into my car.  I'll take you to the hospital so you can see\n","<P> 2    your child and reassure yourself that everything is all right.  They both\n","<P> 3    entered the vehicle.  In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and\n","<P> 4    dressed Vlatka's wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the\n","<P> 5    daughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them.\"\n","<P> 6       Q.   So this is Dulovic's report from the Vukovar war theatre.\n","<P> 7       A.   Yes.\n","<P> 8       Q.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on\n","<P> 9    the following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points\n","<P>10    are.  This large title, this heading, that is.\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.  Now it's been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a\n","<P>12    statement, \"I believed in the army.\"  And what's in the subtitle.  \"A\n","<P>13    little less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in\n","<P>14    Vukovar.\"  And then there's a quotation.\n","<P>15       A.   \"We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the\n","<P>16    guards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the\n","<P>17    hospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims.\"\n","<P>18       Q.   And look what it says in the article.\n","<P>19       A.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the\n","<P>20    following:  \"In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and\n","<P>21    barricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house\n","<P>22    number 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,\n","<P>23    Milos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.  A few days\n","<P>24    later, the members of the guards burst into the cellar.  These were\n","<P>25    members of the Croatian National Guard Corps.  Get out or we'll throw a\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    bomb in.  The Chetniks are coming.  They're cutting everyone's throats.\n","<P> 2    We're taking you to a shelter.\"\n","<P> 3       Q.   It's quite illegible.  Could you put some light on it?\n","<P> 4            Look at the passages marked in yellow.  You don't have to read it\n","<P> 5    all out, just a few passages.\n","<P> 6       A.    \"Several of us -- or, rather, above us on the cemetery the guards\n","<P> 7    members were stationed.  Milka Vidovic said, 'When they visited us in the\n","<P> 8    cellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone's throats.  We\n","<P> 9    Serbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the\n","<P>10    only thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.  I\n","<P>11    believed in our army and I believed they would arrive.'\"\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  What's the question in relation to this,\n","<P>13    Mr. Milosevic?\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>15       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what is the signature marked in yellow here?\n","<P>16       A.   Jovan Dulovic.  The same Jovan Dulovic who four or five years\n","<P>17    later changed his version by -- he turned around by 180 degrees because he\n","<P>18    has become a mercenary of the Western intelligence services, and he writes\n","<P>19    for the magazine Vreme which is the Belgrade branch of Western\n","<P>20    intelligence agencies.\n","<P>21       Q.   Mr. Seselj, when you glanced through this article and you dealt\n","<P>22    with it in your submission, is there a single word here which does not\n","<P>23    speak favourably of the JNA and the people who fought in Vukovar?\n","<P>24       A.   No.  The texts are all exceptionally favourable, full of praise\n","<P>25    for the soldiers and officers of the JNA during the fighting for Vukovar.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Would you look at the next page, please.  Let's just see what the\n","<P> 2    date is.\n","<P> 3       A.   The 18th, I suppose.  The 18th of November.\n","<P> 4       Q.   Well, move on.  Move on.\n","<P> 5       A.   Mr. Milosevic, Dulovic says here one day with volunteers and tank\n","<P> 6    crews in the street fighting for the liberation of Vukovar.  He praises\n","<P> 7    the volunteers who participated in the fighting for Vukovar as part of the\n","<P> 8    JNA.  So this should be noted.\n","<P> 9            Next page, please.  I think that it's very important to point this\n","<P>10    out.\n","<P>11       Q.   And the signature is Jovan Dulovic.  What's the title of this\n","<P>12    article?\n","<P>13       A.   The title of this article is \"The Knights of Vukovar.\"\n","<P>14       Q.   And who does it refer to?\n","<P>15       A.   The units of Major Borivoje Tesic on the front line in Vukovar.\n","<P>16    Major Borivoje Tesic I think -- says: \"I think this is the last stage of\n","<P>17    the fighting.  Crews carrying out their tasks successfully and the help of\n","<P>18    brave people is indispensable.\"  It speaks of Croatian Ustasha and so on.\n","<P>19       Q.   Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic\n","<P>22    said volunteers as part of JNA.  Could you show us the passage where\n","<P>23    Mr. Dulovic said so?\n","<P>24            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He says here:  \"One day with\n","<P>25    volunteers and tank crews in the street fighting for the liberation of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Vukovar.\"  This is above the headline.\n","<P> 2            Then he goes on to say:  \"Speaking favourably of Stanko Vujanovic,\n","<P> 3    he says the commander of the 1st Company of the Territorial Defence of\n","<P> 4    Vukovar who is said to be a man who knows no fear.\" It's quite difficult\n","<P> 5    to read this.  My eyesight is not so good and this is not very legible.\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 7       Q.   Can it be enlarged?\n","<P> 8       A.   \"With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making\n","<P> 9    openings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze\n","<P>10    through and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.  The house in\n","<P>11    which they stopped in Prugomijska [phoen] Street near the Brdo cafe is\n","<P>12    under constant fire by snipers whose positionings are very difficult to\n","<P>13    discern.\"\n","<P>14            JUDGE KWON:  Now, Mr. Seselj, I would like see to see the passage\n","<P>15    which shows that they were part of JNA as you indicated.  Or was it your\n","<P>16    comment?\n","<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  Please.  In the entire text the\n","<P>18    volunteers are spoken of as members of the JNA.  We have passage here in\n","<P>19    the third column where it says it's in the late afternoon and the fighting\n","<P>20    is dying down.  The volunteers --\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Could you use the pointer.  And you indicate on the\n","<P>22    newspaper on the ELMO, not your monitor.  Yes.\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] \"It's late in the afternoon and the\n","<P>24    fighting is dying down.  The volunteers have pierced deep, and they have\n","<P>25    conquered territory between the enemy forces.  The fighters will stay here\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    until the morning.  There were no casualties today except for one soldier\n","<P> 2    who was killed, and his name was Vignjevic.\"\n","<P> 3            He then says:  \"We are going back while shells are flying over our\n","<P> 4    heads and Howitzer shells and so on.\"\n","<P> 5            This whole text implies that the volunteers why part of the JNA.\n","<P> 6    Mr. Kwon, you have here an order showing that these volunteers joined the\n","<P> 7    1st Guards Brigade.  The order was delivered to the OTP from Belgrade and\n","<P> 8    it's beyond dispute.\n","<P> 9            In the Vukovar, there were no troops outside the JNA.

MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>18       Q.   Look at the next page, please.  The following text or this one\n","<P>19    again says the Knights of Vukovar, Major Borivoje Tesic's units on the\n","<P>20    front line, and this is a large article which seems not to be by Dulovic,\n","<P>21    but on the left-hand side there is a small one:  \"Brave commander falls,\n","<P>22    Borovo Selo.\"  Would you look at the signature?  I believe it's by\n","<P>23    Dulovic.  Could you scroll up?\n","<P>24       A.   Yes.\n","<P>25       Q.   What does it say in the passage marked by yellow?\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   The initials \"JD\" mean Jovan Dulovic.\n","<P> 2       Q.   And what does it say in this last passage?\n","<P> 3       A.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- \"The inhabitants of the\n","<P> 4    Crepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,\n","<P> 5    who with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village\n","<P> 6    and one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the\n","<P> 7    highest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages.\"\n","<P> 8       Q.   And he was killed?\n","<P> 9       A.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives\n","<P>10    him.  Next page.\n","<P>11       Q.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a\n","<P>12    look?  I haven't had time to look at it all carefully.\n","<P>13       A.   Yes.  There's a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of\n","<P>14    November.  \"Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate\n","<P>15    Vukovar.\"\n","<P>16            In these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate\n","<P>17    Vukovar, and five years later he's saying something completely different.\n","<P>18             \"Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in\n","<P>19    Vukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb.\"  And then it\n","<P>20    says:  \"The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back,\" and so on\n","<P>21    and so forth.\n","<P>22            So this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the\n","<P>23    JNA.\n","<P>24       Q.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It's been circled.\n","<P>25       A.   Yes.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Very well.\n","<P> 2       A.   The 4th of November, 1991.  \"For two days fierce fighting has not\n","<P> 3    stopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in\n","<P> 4    flames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of\n","<P> 5    Njusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the\n","<P> 6    Territorial Defence.  Advances by Territorial Defence units and volunteers\n","<P> 7    from the direction of Trpinja stopped on the edge of Borovo Naselje.\"\n","<P> 8            He then speaks of a Croatian mortar attack on Bobota [phoen] and\n","<P> 9    so on.\n","<P>10       Q.   Is this another report by Dulovic?\n","<P>11       A.   Yes, it's signed by Jovan Dulovic.\n","<P>12       Q.   Is there anything else, any other report?\n","<P>13       A.   I'm looking at another text here but I can't see whether it's by\n","<P>14    Dulovic or not because it's not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian\n","<P>15    volunteer guard but again a very favourable text.  I couldn't see -- I\n","<P>16    can't see the name of the author here.  I can't see it on this page.\n","<P>17       Q.   Is there anything else underneath, another report?\n","<P>18       A.   \"Who are the volunteers,\" is the next title.\n","<P>19       Q.   Well, I can't see anything anymore.\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced\n","<P>21    through the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is \"Through the holes\n","<P>22    to the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?\n","<P>23    Unknown ammunition with inhumane bullets.\"\n","<P>24            What happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used\n","<P>25    weapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    because the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal\n","<P> 2    organs.\n","<P> 3       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I can't see what it says here in yellow, highlighted\n","<P> 4    in yellow.\n","<P> 5       A.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It's Major Radic now\n","<P> 6    who also stands accused in The Hague.  \"Throughout the month of October,\n","<P> 7    the fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in\n","<P> 8    the clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least\n","<P> 9    one person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja\n","<P>10    [phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in\n","<P>11    that way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had\n","<P>12    taken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.\n","<P>13    The snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own\n","<P>14    control and then a solution was found to move through the houses.\"\n","<P>15       Q.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic's article\n","<P>16    again?\n","<P>17       A.   Well, it's not legible but it is a series of articles by him.  We\n","<P>18    can't find a signature here but quite obviously it is a series of articles\n","<P>19    by him.\n","<P>20       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  Is that a series of articles to which you\n","<P>21    referred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect\n","<P>22    to Dulovic's testimony?\n","<P>23       A.   Yes.  But this isn't the complete material.  My legal advisors\n","<P>24    found many more texts of this kind and they quote them in extenso, and in\n","<P>25    my submission I state my intention to disclose them in keeping with\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Rule 67 of the rules of evidence.\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, I have one more question\n","<P> 3    [as interpreted] -- Robinson, I have a question for you.  As my associates\n","<P> 4    have managed to come by a set of these or at least photocopies of the\n","<P> 5    papers from 1991 which Mr. Seselj refers to in his submission to the other\n","<P> 6    side, the presentation of these photocopies, is that sufficient grounds\n","<P> 7    for my request that they be accepted as exhibits, that Mr. Seselj's\n","<P> 8    submission be accepted as an exhibit?\n","<P> 9            MR. NICE:  Rather interesting issues, I think, arise on the\n","<P>10    validity of these documents as exhibits, and it may be necessary to go\n","<P>11    back and remind ourselves of what Mr. Dulovic himself said about these\n","<P>12    matters.  So I would respectfully invite the Chamber to put that matter\n","<P>13    back.  But may we see the -- may we have access to this material tonight\n","<P>14    in copy form in any event?  It may be we have them elsewhere, but it will\n","<P>15    be a difficult task to find them and it may in any event not be an\n","<P>16    identical collection.  I simply don't know.\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, we'll have to consider the\n","<P>18    application that you're making.

[Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some\n","questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian\n","indictment, that have to do with the \"Rump Presidency\" as it's called\n","here.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  \"The Rump Presidency\n","carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies,\" and so on and so forth, \"had\n","\n","\n","\n","effect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief.\"\n","I'm not going to ask you to repeat what you've already said, but\n","in relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of\n","Serbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they\n","not take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency\n","of the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any\n","objective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from\n","carrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?\n","The question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,\n","Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the\n","SFRY Presidency in Belgrade?\n","A.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,\n","staying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was\n","never a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from\n","carrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped\n","coming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had\n","practically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe\n","Mesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying\n","that they could not come because they could not strike a balance in\n","relation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and\n","Montenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.\n","The representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were\n","not expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was\n","actually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display\n","such feelings at the time.  It's only when he left Belgrade and when he\n","\n","\n","\n","came back to the Croatian parliament that he said, \"I've completed my\n","duty.  Yugoslavia is no more.\"\n","He pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.\n","Also, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him\n","sufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he\n","condemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most\n","cooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was\n","what he was.\n","I already said that according to the constitution of the then\n","Yugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one\n","single member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been\n","prevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could\n","have gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could\n","have refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the\n","Presidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the\n","Presidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed\n","within the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably\n","before Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a\n","Rump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of\n","a rump Presidency.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  \"Slobodan Milosevic,\n","in his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that\n","Yugoslavia was finished.\"\n","\n","\n","\n","Please, you've got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I'm not\n","going to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much\n","time.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to\n","here or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that\n","Yugoslavia was finished?\n","A.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say\n","that Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you\n","never said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I\n","remember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the\n","behaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went\n","through a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,\n","constitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,\n","but then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional\n","provision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases\n","to exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the\n","matter.\n","The leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never\n","did it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and\n","Croatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and\n","Macedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro\n","proclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting\n","of two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration\n","on your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   \"In March 1991 the collective Presidency of the SFRY reached a\n","deadlock on several issues.\"  That is paragraph 56.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... that sentence\n","which is at the beginning of the paragraph.  There's another allegation in\n","that last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no\n","longer be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask\n","Mr. Seselj whether that is so.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember\n","at that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian\n","public, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the\n","decisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that\n","Serbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation\n","when the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.\n","I would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there\n","was a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the\n","headquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long\n","debate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the\n","demand of the military to declare a state of emergency.\n","The top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the\n","behaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a\n","vote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.  As far as I can\n","remember --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  You have answered the question I asked, thanks.\n","Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   That is what is referred to here.  It says the representatives on\n","the Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,\n","the autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of\n","Kosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what\n","was so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the\n","Presidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?\n","A.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also\n","start the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven't got the document here\n","so I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were\n","actually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already\n","started putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the\n","Presidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the\n","Presidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not\n","very constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the\n","Presidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,\n","or Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.\n","I think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been\n","recalled in the meantime.\n","Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that\n","session or before that session or in relation to that session I never\n","declared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did\n","they declare that Yugoslavia was finished?\n","A.   I've already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian\n","politicians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was\n","one of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be\n","\n","\n","\n","hard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.\n","As for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in\n","Montenegro either.\n","Q.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to\n","normal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic\n","was elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented\n","Vojvodina at the time.\n","A.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the\n","Presidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started\n","working again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its\n","work.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of\n","Bosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil\n","Tupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new\n","crisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be\n","elected president of the Presidency.\n","There was a principle involved that the president of the\n","Presidency was elected from a different republican province every year but\n","nobody's election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic\n","did not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European\n","envoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to\n","elect him nevertheless.\n","Q.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?\n","A.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting\n","the preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from\n","those positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says\n","that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and\n","discussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between\n","Serbia and Croatia?\n","A.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I\n","remember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what\n","was skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching\n","agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the\n","Bosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a\n","situation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it\n","increasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the\n","country at the time.\n","At that time, I -- as I've already said, the presidents of the\n","presidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys\n","had actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach\n","agreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia\n","increasingly so.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through\n","what medium?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully\n","being bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media\n","this kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were\n","already at that time being financed from the West by different Western\n","intelligence agencies, so that's the kind of media I'm talking about.  In\n","Belgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a\n","\n","\n","\n","federal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic\n","government, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government\n","in Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the\n","Western powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante\n","Markovic's government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible\n","agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia\n","together under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been\n","eliminated.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at\n","one stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence\n","counsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest\n","collaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This\n","denies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of\n","Bosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted\n","into evidence and if not we will find this transcript.\n","However, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with\n","you as you were an active participant in all political events.  This\n","meeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the\n","division of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any\n","member of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning\n","of which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way\n","even indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?\n","A.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even\n","\n","\n","\n","if Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia\n","as an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as\n","a constituent nation as they had been before in the previous\n","constitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the\n","first president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it\n","was not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint\n","state.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans\n","persuaded him to call off the agreement.\n","Q.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It\n","says:  \"On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY\n","Presidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,\n","Sejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY\n","Presidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the\n","Presidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and\n","Macedonia.\"\n","On the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.  Was this\n","a kind of takeover of the function of the Presidency or were these\n","functions being carried out by the legal representatives?\n","A.   There was absolutely no takeover.  When four of the members of the\n","Presidency withdrew and some of them officially gave notice that they were\n","no longer members, like Drnovsek, for instance, while others simply\n","stopped attending the sessions.  The Presidency continued working with the\n","members who -- whom it was possible to gather together.\n","I suggest that the Chamber get hold of this piece of legislation.\n","I cannot quote it verbatim right now, but I'm absolutely sure it existed.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","And according to this piece of legislation, even if the majority of\n","members could not meet, the Presidency under certain circumstances would\n","continue working with the members who were present.\n","Let me remind you that in the spring of 1991 or in the early\n","summer, there was a vote taken to declare a imminent threat of war.\n","Q.   In paragraph 65 it says:  \"On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,\n","Slobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal\n","enterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from\n","Belgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the\n","mobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay\n","in Yugoslavia.\"\n","First of all, let's establish when I began advocating a unitary\n","Serb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And\n","secondly, was this anyone's idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,\n","and is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever\n","been a unitary state?\n","A.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as\n","Yugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally\n","and your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt\n","the new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the\n","autonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the\n","Serb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of\n","autonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an\n","option.\n","Furthermore, when the four former federal units had already been\n","\n","\n","\n","recognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the\n","Montenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be\n","promulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump\n","Yugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would\n","have been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -\n","because that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary\n","Serbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this\n","but didn't want to, and I am sorry that you didn't do that, because up to\n","the point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --\n","in Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It\n","appeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.\n","Q.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any\n","of my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who\n","were allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had\n","any kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?\n","A.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated\n","with you advocated such an idea.\n","Q.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it\n","says here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of\n","reservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the\n","reasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was\n","called for?\n","A.   I'm not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation\n","of reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to\n","mobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA\n","\n","\n","\n","to take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the\n","territorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that\n","this mobilisation didn't go well.  The response was very poor, because\n","Veljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn't want to remove the\n","communist insignia from the military uniforms.\n","The Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the\n","Presidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was\n","Prime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in\n","Slovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of\n","such an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops\n","into Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then\n","leadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as\n","I know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership\n","which had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.\n","Q.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your\n","name, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask\n","you now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of\n","April, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan's and\n","Seselj's men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you\n","know anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and\n","cart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of\n","cooperation with Arkan's volunteer guard?\n","A.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","did not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert\n","that, I'm saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no\n","\n","\n","\n","organised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as\n","much as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.\n","That's a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb\n","Radical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty\n","to Serbia.  I guarantee that.\n","The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict\n","instructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb\n","volunteer guard up to the --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm asking why was that instruction given to the\n","volunteers of the Serb Radical Party?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.\n","We didn't want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn't\n","want people's awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.\n","As I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,\n","long before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had\n","quarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was\n","in danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this\n","in the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding\n","that instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with\n","Arkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You're\n","not there with them.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can't say that not a single\n","volunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There's one\n","instance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a\n","\n","\n","\n","teacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical\n","Party.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of\n","about 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back\n","but, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of\n","Arkan's men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.\n","So, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint\n","military activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with\n","Arkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a\n","distance from Arkan.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.\n","Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on\n","transcript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia\n","took place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj's\n","White Eagles.\n","First of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and\n","secondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj's White Eagles?\n","A.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb\n","people organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have\n","already said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of\n","volunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After\n","that, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we\n","had volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never\n","had anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.\n","\n","\n","\n","There was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo\n","Selo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he\n","was killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not\n","carrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no\n","joint military activities.\n","Q.   Let's clarify this.  It doesn't say here that you cooperated.  It\n","says here:  \"With infiltration of Seselj's White Eagles.\"  So the White\n","Eagles are being ascribed to you.\n","A.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the\n","Prosecutor bringing witnesses here who don't no anything about what\n","happened on the ground.  It's simply nonsense to talk of a group called\n","Seselj's White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and\n","the Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn't know\n","what he was talking about.\n","Q.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,\n","2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that \"Seselj collected men in\n","Erdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia.\"  Is that\n","true, Mr. Seselj?\n","JUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493\n","who testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake\n","in my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that\n","particular page, and the page is 19003.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send\n","\n","\n","\n","them to Bosnia?\n","A.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in\n","Erdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,\n","nicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only\n","time.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --\n","we never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there\n","either, and I can state that quite categorically.\n","The people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the\n","war and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were\n","exclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I\n","absolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan's centre in Erdut\n","later on.  We never had anything to do with it.\n","Q.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is\n","20294, says that Arkan's and Seselj's men shot above the heads of the\n","civilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in\n","Bratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who\n","mistreated and abused the civilians?\n","A.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian\n","Radical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my\n","knowledge Arkan didn't appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in\n","Zvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in\n","Bratunac either.  And I've already said that in Bratunac there was\n","Deronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there\n","I was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have\n","very certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj's men were\n","in Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj's\n","mean there is no difference, says he.\n","A.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can't see any\n","difference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the\n","White Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at\n","all.  And that's not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some\n","judgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to\n","see in some other places Seselj's White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the\n","problem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses\n","which it manipulates.\n","Q.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on\n","several occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --\n","MR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven't been able to check this myself\n","because the accused hasn't been getting the references correct, and it's\n","quite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I'm grateful to\n","Ms. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came\n","(redacted).\n","But, really, I'm afraid we've got to have correct references for the\n","witnesses.  We can't simply just go to the page in the transcript.\n","Frequently our page numbers don't necessarily coincide here in court, and\n","without reference to the witnesses it's very difficult to pick it up\n","later.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in\n","pinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you're referring.  Now,\n","\n","\n","\n","Judge Kwon has already corrected you once, and apparently there is another\n","mistake in the reference.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, perhaps there might be a\n","mistake with the name, but there is no mistake with the quotation from the\n","transcript, and my question relates to the material facts which are being\n","mentioned here.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, we have to follow it, Mr. Milosevic.  There\n","is duty on you to be more careful.\n","Please proceed.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. Robinson.  And I'll\n","check this out to see whether indeed it is the same witness from\n","page 20352, the transcript line and page, the quotation that I mentioned\n","earlier on or, rather, 20351 is the exact number.  I'll check that out\n","during the break.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript\n","said that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of\n","March, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan's men took part as well as\n","Seselj's men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the\n","occupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on\n","the 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of\n","your volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?\n","A.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What\n","happened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between\n","the JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The\n","\n","\n","\n","Muslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.\n","However, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went\n","on for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting\n","the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was\n","there, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my\n","knowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of\n","the local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to\n","establish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the\n","ground there.\n","I know -- have reliable information that the commands and the\n","officers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan's and\n","the Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a\n","great deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very\n","rarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.\n","As far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,\n","over there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did\n","appear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the\n","call of Biljana Plavsic.  I can't prove that, but I do know that Biljana\n","Plavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly\n","meeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The\n","volunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina\n","were not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the\n","Serbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were\n","residents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the\n","conflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves\n","\n","\n","\n","and Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan's right-hand man.  And in\n","Serbia we didn't send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something\n","for me in relation to the Prosecution's case.  In the Bosnia indictment\n","the allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other\n","members of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the\n","Prosecution case unfolded, you're not saying, are you, that he acted\n","alone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with\n","other members of the joint criminal enterprise.\n","MR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven't reviewed each and every allegation\n","to check that there isn't one there that may be susceptible to individual\n","perpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he's working with others.\n","MR. NICE:  Yes.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually\n","your case.  It's not that he acted alone.\n","MR. NICE:  Subject to the point I've just made.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you've made, yes.\n","MR. NICE:  Yes.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Very well, Mr. Seselj.  You've just heard that explanation too.\n","Now, since you know the relationships very well between people at that\n","time, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and\n","Zvornik yourself.  Now, did I or any organs of power and authority have\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","anything to do with Arkan's volunteer guard?\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet.\n","MR. NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and\n","I think perhaps there's this qualification, although I don't think it is a\n","qualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this\n","accused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top\n","political level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are\n","criminal in nature.  It's the standard method of generation of\n","genocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar\n","[phoen].\n","Now, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other\n","people.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may\n","be minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in\n","those circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting\n","alone in certain circumstances, but that's the only qualification I think\n","I should make.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it's a point that will warrant some\n","consideration later on, yes.\n","Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   So Arkan is mentioned here as well as Mauzer.  Did I or anybody\n","else from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all\n","and with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?\n","A.   I'm quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.\n","On the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open\n","\n","\n","\n","contacts with Arkan.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many\n","questions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the\n","evidence he's giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,\n","how is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan\n","or Mauzer?\n","He's giving evidence.  He's saying that you had nothing to do with\n","him.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to\n","establish how he's in a position to make that statement.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that\n","cannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from\n","the authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or\n","relationship with Arkan or Mauzer?\n","A.   In Belgrade you couldn't hide anything like that.  It would be\n","impossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is\n","that kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become\n","public.\n","Second, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts\n","only with Zoran Djindjic.  And I've already spoken about the relationship\n","between Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic's vice-president and the\n","president of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his\n","pre-electoral campaign.\n","Q.   Let's clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did\n","you have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be\n","\n","\n","\n","able to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in\n","Bijeljina?\n","A.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina\n","sufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,\n","including Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this\n","trial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events\n","that went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in\n","Bijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements\n","and held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and\n","severely criticised Mauzer's conduct, especially Mauzer's conduct towards\n","the Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am\n","preparing them for my own trial, which doesn't seem to be starting.\n","Q.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack\n","on the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the\n","JNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by\n","the Red Berets or, rather, Arkan's and Seselj's men.  So that's the\n","quotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan's\n","and Seselj's men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red\n","Berets were they?  What Arkan's men were they, Seselj's men were they\n","around Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?\n","A.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the\n","witness don't seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened\n","to see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red\n","cap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.\n","And then he -- the witness doesn't know whether they were Seselj's men or\n","\n","\n","\n","Arkan's men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it's\n","highly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of\n","his head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify\n","so-called Seselj's men and Arkan's men and these alleged Red Berets.\n","As for the Red Berets, I've already given you reliable facts about\n","them and said that name appeared in different situations relating to\n","different military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina\n","area where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then\n","the army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of\n","the intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until\n","the special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of\n","Serbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this\n","misunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed\n","to people with -- which they had nothing to do with.\n","Q.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the\n","following:  \"Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia\n","who were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done.\"\n","That's when this witness claims.\n","A.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He's a colonel by\n","rank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff\n","of the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the\n","number two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that's the same\n","Osman Selak that you're referring to.\n","Q.   Well, I can't tell you that.\n","A.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of\n","\n","\n","\n","Republika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a\n","statement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,\n","what the circumstances were in which I said it.\n","I did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the\n","secession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia\n","seceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,\n","and for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he\n","personally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.\n","As far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from\n","Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of\n","Yugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and\n","Raska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of\n","examples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army\n","perform their duty very honourably.\n","So the citizens --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are\n","saying that you did make such a statement or you didn't make such a\n","statement.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if\n","you don't show me something like that here, where and when.  Let us see\n","the statement concerned.  Let me identify it.  I gave thousands and\n","thousands of statements in public.  They were publicly recorded.  They\n","were published.  So let's see.\n","My objection is precisely in that.  Why did this Osman Selak not\n","\n","\n","\n","say where and when?\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  That's helpful to some extent.  Does it follow from\n","the answer you've just given that you could have said it?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I could have said it along the\n","following lines, that those in the army who came from the renegade\n","republics in principle should not remain at positions in the Yugoslav\n","army.  You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live\n","in Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in\n","the army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as\n","officers?\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  That's simply confusing me further.  The quote was\n","that you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims\n","and Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that\n","you could possibly have made that statement in these terms?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not saying that I made that kind\n","of statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak\n","testified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise\n","lines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman\n","Selak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be\n","established.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the\n","Prosecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly\n","what I said.\n","I am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,\n","but it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you're asking me to do is\n","to comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman\n","\n","\n","\n","Selak's view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make\n","my statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm\n","trying to understand the answer you've given to the question asked by\n","Mr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you've just said, the problem is\n","that you've been studying this yourself, and you're trying to justify a\n","position of your own without really dealing specifically with the question\n","that's being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears\n","now to be that you couldn't possibly have made a statement of that nature,\n","although you might have said something much more specific about different\n","people but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.\n","Now, is that a fair summary of your position?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I'm not sure, by think you're\n","very close.  However, in order to help you, I'm going to give you an\n","example.\n","Throughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were\n","informed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,\n","escaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of\n","confidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998\n","we had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of\n","the military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his\n","family abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives\n","there.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn't remotely sound as if it's\n","going to be at all helpful to me, so we'll proceed with Mr. Milosevic's\n","\n","\n","\n","questions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you\n","was about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist\n","statement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple\n","issue I'm not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further\n","if he wishes.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in\n","no uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that\n","any statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never\n","in my life have I made a racist statement.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  There's nothing for you to respond to.\n","Mr. Milosevic, the next question.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, I'm afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I\n","put a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific\n","terms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated\n","\n","\n","\n","here that \"Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia\n","who were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed.\"  Did you ever state\n","that?\n","A.   No, I didn't say it that way.\n","Q.   So you didn't say it that way --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... matter.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  And why on earth it should take all this time to\n","establish that simple issue, I do not know.\n","Perhaps it would help, Mr. Seselj, if you just listened to the\n","questions and answer the question that's actually asked rather than try to\n","make political statements about your own position.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not making political statements,\n","Mr. Bonomy.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He\n","mentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether\n","those facts are correct.  And first of all, I'm interested in the\n","circumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  \"Just after\n","the bombing Seselj came to Pale.\"  And then on page 26762 he\n","says:  \"Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to\n","support the Bosnian Serbs.\"  These are a few facts that referred to.\n","Could you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this\n","actually all about?\n","A.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of\n","\n","\n","\n","Republika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the\n","leadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly\n","engaged in an anti-Serb policy.\n","As for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market\n","itself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the\n","street of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these\n","are explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of\n","whether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar\n","shells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.\n","This was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the\n","Serbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the\n","threats that were made, and so on and so forth.\n","Q.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there\n","you did so only to give political support to the leadership of\n","Republika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and\n","bombing.\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  \"In January or February\n","1992\" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, \"Arkan's\n","and Seselj's units arrived in Doboj.\"\n","Is this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?\n","A.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,\n","there were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.\n","Secondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to\n","Doboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan's Tigers never\n","\n","\n","\n","operated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.\n","Q.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to\n","this question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on\n","transcript page 27738, quite explicitly, \"Mirko Blagojevic,\" that is to\n","say, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he\n","says:  \"Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,\n","and he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with\n","Seselj.\"\n","I am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical\n","Party or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that\n","Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So\n","please deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the\n","transcript.  Is it correct or not?\n","A.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is\n","organised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A\n","conflict occurs when two armed formations clash.\n","Mirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in\n","Bijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim\n","formations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any\n","conflicts.  And I guarantee with my own life that he took part in no\n","looting, no persecutions, no maltreatment of the civilian population and\n","so on and so forth.  I'm absolutely certain of that.\n","Q.   Thank you.\n","A.   I can fully identify with everything that Mirko Blagojevic did.\n","It is to that degree that I'm certain that he never did anything against\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the law.\n","Q.   Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  \"Seselj's\n","men tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm.\"\n","A.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?\n","Q.   My understanding is it's somewhere near Zvornik.\n","A.   That's quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","Party took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there\n","in brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on\n","for a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the\n","Muslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to\n","an end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","withdrew.\n","I preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on\n","guarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing\n","happened, I would have had to know about it.\n","Q.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you\n","personally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following\n","circumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  \"Seselj,\n","on Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired\n","it at Muslims in Sarajevo.\"  This was shown on television, and he said\n","that you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.\n","A.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at\n","Grbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called\n","international observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go\n","around the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the\n","\n","\n","\n","Serb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was\n","an apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I\n","used a Browning machine-gun from there.  It's a heavy machine-gun.  I\n","couldn't carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry\n","it around.\n","Q.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.\n","A.   You cannot carry it.  It's too long.  It was installed in that\n","building, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches\n","below the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of\n","the volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was\n","firing from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and\n","the top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is\n","something I don't know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who\n","could have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this\n","small participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.\n","A Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that\n","case, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been\n","forced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of\n","those who in violation of international law of war brought him out there\n","to dig trenches, not those who --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,\n","that at the beginning of April Seselj's men arrived in the area of\n","Bratunac and Zvornik.\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic's part.  He knows\n","full well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing\n","who he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and\n","making this sweeping statement Seselj's men arrived in Bratunac and\n","Zvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it's as if they were in Bratunac\n","too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so\n","Deronjic invented that.\n","In Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the\n","Bratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was\n","commander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he\n","was not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,\n","then a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.  I think the interpreter is having\n","some difficulty.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will.\n","You could have noticed, Mr. Robinson, that I have been trying as\n","of late to speak slowly, but sometimes, every now and then, I may forget\n","what you cautioned me about.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, I had noticed, and the -- we are\n","appreciative of the effort you are making.  You have answered the\n","question.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the meantime --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think you have answered that question.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   So they were not in Bratunac at all?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in\n","Bratunac.\n","Q.   All right.  So you are saying that he's not telling the truth.\n","The same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not\n","agree that Seselj was a true opposition.\n","A.   The Hague OTP and Judge Schomburg on several occasions caught\n","Deronjic lying.  And even in Deronjic's judgement you can find about seven\n","different points as ascertained by Judge Schomburg, namely that Deronjic\n","was lying.\n","Secondly, in the case of people who are inclined to a pro-Western\n","policy or are mercenaries of Western intelligence agencies, or in order to\n","save their own skin they go into plea bargaining with the OTP and\n","therefore appear as witnesses in the trials of other people, it can often\n","be heard that those who are really opposition but are not prepared to\n","serve the West --\n","MR. NICE:  I'm not sure this is responsive to any question --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Are you interrupting me?\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet, Mr. Seselj, and he's\n","entitled to make an objection if he wishes.\n","MR. NICE:  He was simply asked if the man was telling the truth.\n","We have his answer and he's now gone on to a long comment basically.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, you have moved into the area of comment.\n","It's now time for the break.\n","Mr. Nice, I should say the question that I asked earlier related\n","to the Bosnia indictment.\n","\n","\n","\n","We will break for 20 minutes.\n","--- Recess taken at 3.41 p.m.\n","--- On resuming at 4.08 p.m.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, you told me to check\n","the pages that Mr. Nice mentioned, 35 -- 20352 and 20351, that is.  This\n","was Witness 1070.\n","On page 20351 he says that Seselj's men were in Bratunac and that\n","there was no difference between them and Seselj's men, the White Eagles,\n","that is.\n","And on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April\n","Seselj's and Arkan's men were in Bratunac together when some people were\n","deported.  And Mr. Seselj answered questions about this.  In the meantime,\n","the liaison officer had the transcript, and I have received a note saying\n","that both references are correct, both as regards page 20351 and 20352,\n","and these refer to Witness 1070.  There was no error.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  All right, Mr. Milosevic.  We'll do our own\n","check.  Thank you for checking anyhow.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, this is the testimony of Miroslav Deronjic, who said\n","that you were not truly an opposition politician or, rather, that you\n","cooperated with the government and that therefore this idea of a joint\n","criminal enterprise is thereby confirmed.  Were you in the opposition or\n","not?\n","THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.\n","\n","\n","\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it\n","on.\n","Both the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time\n","were distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as\n","it's possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by\n","Deronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the\n","opposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint\n","often expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various\n","government and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person\n","of the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or\n","Miles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery\n","and so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while\n","criticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition\n","politicians, and this logic is completely upside down.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Witness Ahmet Zulic says, and that's on page 30000 of the\n","transcript, he says that Seselj's men were stationed in the partisan\n","cemetery in Pobrezje, that doesn't matter so much but what matters is the\n","following, that they had come there to kill the Muslims.\n","A.   Where is this place?  Pobrezje?  Where is it?\n","Q.   I have a note here in Pobrezje.  I can't be more specific than\n","that.\n","But let me put a question to you:  Did your volunteers go anywhere\n","to kill all Muslims?\n","A.   No.  Nowhere did the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party go to\n","\n","\n","\n","kill Muslims or Croats or any kind of civilians.  Wherever they went, they\n","were part of the JNA, and they went there to fight against the\n","paramilitary units that wanted to break up Yugoslavia.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, it's important to know the\n","location.  I'm not sure whether Mr. Nice or Mr. Kay can help.  Your note\n","doesn't identify clearly the name of this place?\n","MR. NICE:  I tried to make an electronic search but for various\n","reasons it doesn't work at the moment or doesn't work for this witness on\n","this particular part of his evidence.  I'll try again.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","JUDGE KWON:  You said Pobrezje.\n","Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   The same witness, Ahmet Zulic, on page 30047, says in Sanski Most\n","there was no fighting, but the civilians fled because Seselj's men were\n","there.\n","Your men caused fear among civilians, although there was no\n","fighting there, as he says, in Sanski Most.\n","A.   That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,\n","throughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did\n","not fight in any location.\n","This reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a\n","certain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying\n","that sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.\n","Somebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is\n","\n","\n","\n","arriving, and he spread panic.\n","THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that the Serbian word for\n","sugar resembles Mr. Seselj's name.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere\n","in that area.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  \"From the\n","1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan\n","Milosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint\n","criminal,\" and so on,\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise\n","aided and abetted,\" and so on and so forth, all these phrases, \"the\n","planning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories\n","of Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,\n","Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.\"\n","Tell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in\n","this joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged\n","crimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made\n","here?\n","A.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from\n","Serbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia\n","and Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted\n","to proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the\n","will of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the\n","West who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or\n","execution or extermination.  There was no plan.\n","\n","\n","\n","When the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in\n","many places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only\n","where the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats\n","were in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,\n","not a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the\n","majority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They\n","had already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.\n","Q.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we\n","have already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the\n","other places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,\n","Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in\n","any kind of military activities?\n","A.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in\n","January, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but\n","the UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,\n","although they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was\n","established, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be\n","\n","disarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.\n","The Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian\n","villages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there\n","were two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active\n","in the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces\n","in the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the\n","only activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica\n","area.  It was in the beginning of 1993.\n","\n","\n","\n","As for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,\n","I don't know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up\n","only in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all\n","over Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army\n","of the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska\n","Krajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his\n","volunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars\n","there, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed\n","and what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy\n","that we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in\n","whole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and\n","Herzegovina?\n","A.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and\n","there was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen\n","happened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on\n","their own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit\n","murders or anything of the kind.\n","Q.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war\n","in Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the\n","other participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by\n","Mr. Nice.\n","Look at paragraph 33.  We've just been discussing paragraph 32.  I\n","won't read the beginning of paragraph 33 because it's the same:  \"From on\n","or about the 1st of March, 1992,\" and so on and so forth, and then it\n","\n","\n","\n","says:  \"On the territory of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa,\n","Bosanski Novi, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Sarajevo (Ilijas), Kljuc,\n","Kalinovik, Kotor Varos, Nevesinje, Sarajevo, Novi Grad, Sarajevo, Novo\n","Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Rudo, Sanski Most, Srebrenica\n","again, Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\"  Please --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  You are finished reading that list.  Let me\n","remind you, Mr. Milosevic, that the Rule 98 bis decision found that there\n","was not enough evidence to support the allegation in paragraph 32 in\n","relation to some of the villages or municipalities mentioned.  In fact, as\n","far as paragraph 32 is concerned, you need only concern yourself with\n","Brcko, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Bijeljina, Kotor Varos, Kljuc,\n","Bosanski Novi.  And I am checking to see whether the decision affected\n","paragraph 33.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, could you please let\n","me know what evidence, as you say there was no evidence for these places,\n","but what was the evidence that Mr. Nice presented here about the other\n","places linking me --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.  Mr. Milosevic, the Rule 98 bis\n","decision was published and was available to you.  But I bring that to your\n","attention so we don't waste time.  And I'll ask the legal officer to give\n","me the information in relation to paragraph 33.\n","Go ahead, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   As I was saying, Mr. Seselj, I read out a list here.  It's a long\n","paragraph with all the names of the towns where I, together with others,\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","am charged with working for the extermination of Muslims and Croats.  You\n","know the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that\n","referred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded\n","in any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?\n","A.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted\n","to, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A\n","civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally\n","wanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a\n","constituent people.\n","And the question arises from there where are the Serbs from\n","Mostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from\n","Travnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from\n","many other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats\n","during that civil war?\n","After the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the\n","population, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did\n","take place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,\n","in figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I\n","can put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes\n","crimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,\n","sometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,\n","criminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and\n","revenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes\n","did not exist.  That did not happen.\n","Q.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the\n","\n","\n","\n","joint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I'd like\n","to draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of\n","December, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33\n","and indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns\n","are repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns\n","too.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.\n","So what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during\n","that period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of\n","December 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring\n","Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n","A.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia\n","or, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of\n","Yugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It\n","did not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help\n","materially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs\n","living over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different\n","political relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership\n","of Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in\n","which those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep\n","conflicts, and they didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues.\n","So throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the\n","indictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,\n","the leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered\n","in looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far\n","accepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists\n","\n","\n","\n","attacked ourselves for our part.\n","So I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy\n","dating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact\n","that that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all\n","costs.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no\n","alternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at\n","the price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept\n","because they were not able to take such great concessions.\n","Q.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities\n","of that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these\n","towns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I\n","personally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,\n","et cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason\n","explanation?\n","A.   Yes, I do, and that's explanation is the following and the fact\n","that through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,\n","and --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not\n","an explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.\n","So please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,\n","Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac\n","again, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in\n","Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,\n","\n","\n","\n","Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with\n","regard to that point of the indictment?\n","A.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised\n","crime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don't know whether in all the\n","places enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took\n","place in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each\n","individual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the\n","motives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are\n","still living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can\n","be established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side\n","and the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to\n","investigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to\n","strike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the\n","number of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.\n","Q.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you've said when you said\n","that some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let's look at\n","that for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of\n","Yugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or\n","formations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes\n","that you know of?  Are there any links?\n","A.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of\n","power and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as\n","well, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,\n","the Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the\n","Academy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,\n","\n","\n","\n","everybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out\n","against them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for\n","freedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were\n","being perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes\n","should be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind\n","via the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political\n","parties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which\n","strove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors\n","spoke out against crimes.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Now, we -- let's look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful\n","confinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,\n","Bosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the\n","territories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,\n","Samac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,\n","Kotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,\n","Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\n","Tell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these\n","people in these towns did we take part in?\n","A.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have\n","had anything to do with any such thing.\n","First of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What\n","the confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of\n","civilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is\n","\n","\n","\n","unlawful, and there were such cases.\n","Now, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of\n","all, there were individual instances in some of these places through the\n","self-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance\n","of Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.\n","And then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of\n","their own because they couldn't influence him.  He appeared as a factor,\n","and there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his\n","motives were of a criminal nature.\n","There were other such cases in some of these places whereby\n","somebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in\n","order to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive\n","money and then release them once they received money for that.  There were\n","also instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,\n","somebody's family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or\n","Croats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often\n","were not able to prevent revenge of that kind.\n","Q.   Which authorities?\n","A.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.\n","Q.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian\n","authorities intervene?\n","A.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn't influence or involve\n","themselves in any such matters.\n","So as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one\n","should take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to\n","\n","\n","\n","those cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and\n","what the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.\n","Now, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places\n","where possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of\n","context and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse\n","top-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian\n","Yugoslavia as well.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has\n","become a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you\n","say that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing\n","like the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged\n","by the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn't understand me correctly,\n","Mr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,\n","but there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top\n","echelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely\n","impossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like\n","that, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is\n","impossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such\n","thing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did\n","commit crimes.  And it wasn't only individuals who committed crimes.\n","There was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.\n","And I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my\n","information, but I can't be well-versed in everything, but I can in\n","basics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It\n","\n","\n","\n","wasn't the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit\n","crimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn't the policy of the\n","leadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.\n","Now, --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn't the policy of this accused in\n","concert with other --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of\n","Mr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,\n","continuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such\n","crimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the\n","most serious form of war crimes.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There's an enormous\n","list of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,\n","and the subject here is deportation.\n","Now, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let's clarify that.  Albeit in\n","Serbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,\n","Muslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\n","70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle\n","of non-discrimination like anybody else.\n","Now, I can't clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is\n","being accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it\n","stated here -- it says:  \"Milosevic, acting alone or together with other\n","members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,\n","\n","\n","\n","committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or\n","execution of the unlawful forcible transfer...\"\n","Now, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic\n","of Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or\n","unlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful\n","movement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one\n","individual?\n","A.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with\n","anything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these\n","phenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what\n","did happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group\n","to leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that\n","desire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were\n","instances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,\n","that people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,\n","something afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind\n","what had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to\n","move out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or\n","perhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they\n","were the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and\n","in some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established\n","in some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete\n","example, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from\n","Prijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a\n","convoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --\n","\n","\n","\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I'm stopping you because you have\n","answered the question.  You are becoming a little too expansive.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think that this would be very\n","important.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, what example do you know of personally?\n","A.   I'm talking about one example when Muslims were transported\n","because they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And\n","then the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose\n","name is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is\n","called Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large\n","group of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the\n","authorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part\n","of Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army\n","of Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.\n","Then he tried to explain this in a completely different way:\n","Somebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he's\n","trying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.\n","Such people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,\n","entered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and\n","then they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed\n","although they are invariably false because --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm stopping you.  Mr. Seselj, no doubt you're a\n","man of many virtues.  Is omniscience one of them?  How do you happen to\n","know all these things?  I have to ask myself that question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","\n","\n","\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Where is your knowledge coming from?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, all my life I have\n","been learning, learning, learning, and constantly learning.  Even now in\n","prison I read eight to ten hours a day, although the conditions under\n","which I live are very poor because they want to prevent me from preparing\n","my defence case properly.  But I'm a constant learner, and I wish others\n","were too.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  It would help my appreciation of your evidence if\n","only occasionally we were told of the basis for the information that you\n","have about specific matters.\n","Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of\n","Serbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and\n","that as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon\n","what do you base this statement?\n","A.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I\n","base my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent\n","statements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.\n","Secondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.\n","They never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never\n","discriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the\n","authorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in\n","Bosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.\n","So there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic\n","whatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution\n","of Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in\n","Serbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal\n","of money.  Perhaps not all of them were happy with what they got, but this\n","involved major expenditure on the part of the state.\n","Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  But did the authorities of Serbia allow\n","discrimination over any Muslim Croat or the member of any other ethnic\n","group in Serbia during the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia?\n","A.   No.  Even if there were any incidents on ethnic grounds, the\n","authorities acted in accordance with the law and brought such matters to\n","trial.  They simply did not allow things like that to happen.\n","Q.   Please look at paragraph 42 now.  Again it says here:  \"Slobodan\n","Milosevic,\" and so on and so forth, on or about the 1st of March, 1992,\n","until 391st of December, 1995, acting alone or in concert with members of\n","the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or\n","otherwise aided and abetted the planning preparation or execution of\n","wanton destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the\n","Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations and then\" --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, too fast.  Too fast.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   So I, Mr. Seselj, according to this paragraph 42, aided and\n","abetted the planning, preparation or execution, I executed this.  It\n","wasn't that I only aided and abetted others, but I committed wanton\n","\n","\n","\n","destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the Bosnian\n","Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations, and again all these\n","municipalities are listed here where I committed wanton looting of\n","property belonging to Muslims and Croats.\n","Please tell us not only what you know about this but also on the\n","basis of what you know what you know.\n","A.   This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in\n","any way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of\n","private and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three\n","sides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything\n","under control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.\n","What happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims\n","would loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have\n","their own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar\n","way in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no\n","official authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No\n","one personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,\n","et cetera.\n","There were paramilitary formations that had looting as their\n","primary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also\n","from Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People\n","travelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize\n","their car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were\n","such cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial\n","Chamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of\n","\n","\n","\n","looting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions\n","that were rather chaotic.\n","There was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.\n","Not only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika\n","Srpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.\n","Q.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in\n","a military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto\n","civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and\n","wounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.\n","You were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please\n","explain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,\n","tell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of\n","Yugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.\n","A.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a\n","dissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict\n","in Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of\n","the duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case\n","elsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on\n","both sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less\n","casualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what\n","Judge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I\n","read.\n","I was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the\n","killing of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted\n","intentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the\n","\n","\n","\n","Muslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present\n","this in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,\n","Vasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not\n","take part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official\n","factors from Serbia, that is.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.  On the transcript it's a double\n","negative.\n","Yes, Mr. --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] There is a double negative in the\n","Serbian language and it does not change the meaning of the statement.  In\n","English it might mean something different.  I'm sorry I don't know English\n","and I cannot really adjust to this.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or\n","deny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took\n","part in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you\n","confirm that?\n","A.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.\n","Q.   All right.  Thank you.\n","A.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The\n","Muslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the\n","liberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.\n","Q.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his\n","witness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,\n","including women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only\n","logical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee\n","from war.  They're fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.\n","Very often in this war and in any other war civilians would get\n","killed by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from\n","the conflict.\n","Q.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the\n","Serbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it's supposed\n","to seem?\n","A.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray\n","this, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their\n","victims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We\n","are faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is\n","based and anti-Serb grounds.\n","Q.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings\n","happened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all\n","of that can be found here in this indictment that I've been quoting to\n","you, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to\n","give.  Ask another question.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a\n","question to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that\n","he can give an answer.  He's a politician, an intellectual, a university\n","professor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,\n","and he is in a position to give an answer to this question.\n","\n","\n","\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  And I've already ruled that he is not to answer\n","it.  So proceed.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the\n","JNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know\n","about that?  This is on transcript page 20408.\n","A.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The\n","two sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the\n","bridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric\n","power plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to\n","destroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old\n","hydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the\n","paramilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The\n","conflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can't say exactly, I\n","wasn't there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And\n","then also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.\n","Q.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units\n","committed crimes in Zvornik.\n","A.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there\n","that can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but\n","who it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are\n","ascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to\n","Karadzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.\n","In Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of\n","\n","\n","\n","people for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing\n","them, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They\n","are mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided\n","by Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,\n","Drinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you\n","heard anything about this and what do you know about it?\n","A.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my\n","knowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but\n","once the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very\n","simply, who the victims were and who the executors were.\n","Q.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the\n","cultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many\n","persons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force\n","there is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I'll just go\n","on.\n","A.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were\n","committed.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn't the JNA that\n","took part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take\n","part in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully\n","investigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims\n","are still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether\n","there was enough will to investigate this matter, and I've already\n","\n","\n","\n","referred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect\n","a great deal from that.\n","Q.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?\n","A.   No, I don't know anything about it.  I wasn't there.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj and Mr. Milosevic, you are not\n","observing the pause between question and answer, and you are thereby\n","creating difficulties for the interpreter.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, this is the first time\n","you have warned us about this today.  As you see, Mr. Seselj and I are\n","bearing this in mind.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We're practising.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment\n","in this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your\n","units.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan's men.  Do\n","you have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your\n","units were there?  You've already explained you didn't have any units of\n","yours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers\n","were there?\n","A.   I'm not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik\n","area.  I know that Arkan's Tigers were active there but to what extent and\n","in what locations I couldn't say because I wasn't there.\n","All the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I\n","do not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and\n","misfortunes he talked about, but evidently he's very confused when\n","\n","\n","\n","identifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He's mixing up Seselj's\n","men, the White Eagles, Arkan's men, and this shows that he's very confused\n","and unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers\n","of the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to\n","everything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very\n","often it's beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn't be easy to\n","establish who actually perpetrated this.\n","Q.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a\n","certain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the\n","transcript.  Do you know anything about this?\n","A.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","committed any crimes in that place.\n","Q.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb\n","Radical Party?\n","A.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party\n","sent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,\n","and as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me\n","had any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I'm sure of it.\n","Q.   Would other volunteers have reported this?\n","A.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and\n","they would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,\n","because this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about\n","the conducts of the volunteers?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn't say the reports were\n","\n","\n","\n","regular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out\n","how the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All\n","the problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of\n","indiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers\n","to be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline\n","of the other men.\n","I was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the\n","conclusion that none occurred.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral\n","conversations.\n","I'm convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written\n","reports would have been sent to me.  I'm sure that the competent command\n","would have told me had something like this happened.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, if you can't recall it doesn't matter, but is it true\n","that in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,\n","1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of\n","Seselj's men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?\n","A.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj's men, then\n","should be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell\n","you whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group\n","of Seselj's men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he's\n","the leader if they don't know his name?  What does the term \"leader\" mean?\n","\n","\n","\n","Was he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times\n","that volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in\n","units larger than a company.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I\n","have a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I\n","wanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the\n","indictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no\n","such instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","Party.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such\n","instances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various\n","allegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of\n","time.\n","Please tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about\n","the events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men\n","participated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\n","A.   First of all --\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is that reference?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I quoted about half an hour ago, but\n","it wasn't sufficiently clear.  I will try to find it again.  I'm simply\n","trying to establish whether the witness knows anything about\n","Bosanski Samac.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have some knowledge but --\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  The answer -- the question I have is --  what do\n","you mean by \"because it says,\" it says, \"that your men participated in\n","taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\"  What is \"it\"?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj something about\n","Samac before, but right now I can't find it.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  I take it it's not another reference to the\n","indictment against Mr. Seselj.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I don't think it is.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have Bosanski Samac mentioned in\n","several places on your indictment, if I can be of assistance, and I can\n","tell you what I know about the events in Bosanski Samac.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Well, that's the only reason I asked you whether you knew\n","anything.\n","A.   In paragraph 42 Bosanski Samac is ascribed to you.\n","Q.   Well, all the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are\n","ascribed to me.  There aren't any which are not ascribed to me.  But what\n","do you know about the events there?\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I don't understand this question.  You\n","can't just ask a question, take a municipality and say, \"What do you know\n","about events there?\"  There's got to be some point to the question.\n","Now, what is this dealing with?\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Very well.  I won't ask you anything about that, then, because I\n","\n","\n","\n","can't find the reference now.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, Mr. Milosevic.  If you find the\n","reference, you can come back to it, but bear in mind that you undertook to\n","complete the evidence in chief today.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I'm doing my best, Mr. Robinson, but\n","there are many, many witnesses who mentioned Mr. Seselj, and I want to see\n","whether there's any truth in anything they said.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, you may -- Mr. Milosevic, you may have\n","other witnesses who may be in a better position to contradict the\n","assertions in the Prosecution case than Mr. Seselj himself.  Don't assume\n","that because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he's the\n","best person to contradict it.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   On page 23520 of the transcript.  I'll skip over the witness's\n","name because I can't recall at present whether or not he was protected,\n","Mr. Robinson.  I don't think he was, because I don't have any note to that\n","effect, but he says:  \"In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the\n","White Wolves, and the JNA participated.\"\n","Do you know anything about this?\n","A.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,\n","there was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from\n","Eastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the\n","indictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.\n","His name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA\n","\n","\n","\n","helicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was\n","accompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","Party, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for\n","sure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also\n","Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as\n","the Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was\n","charged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in\n","Banja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical\n","Party.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and\n","the party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.\n","Q.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don't know that Kragujevac\n","is not in Bosnia.\n","A.   That's correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I'm getting ready\n","to obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was\n","expelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan\n","Savic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the\n","Serb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave\n","my legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial\n","and all the accompanying materials.\n","As for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to\n","me certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man\n","Radovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his\n","participation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.\n","Those are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members\n","of the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know\n","\n","\n","\n","had previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even\n","called him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was\n","Srecko Radovanovic.\n","There was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was\n","certainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was\n","certainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been\n","he would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that\n","unit was called the Grey Wolves.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I've understood\n","from that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions\n","in Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you've said?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,\n","yes.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called\n","the Grey Wolves active there?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it's very problematic to say\n","paramilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means\n","outside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial\n","Defence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I'm not\n","sure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,\n","I think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good\n","fighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what\n","happened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called\n","Crkvina or something like that.  I can't recall it all off the top of my\n","head, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in\n","\n","\n","\n","Banja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven't dealt with.  Did\n","they participate?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What\n","Red Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  That's a perfectly legitimate answer for you to\n","give, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the\n","Red Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the\n","quotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,\n","which on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they've got\n","nothing to do with the question.  So all I'm doing now is trying to find\n","out what the real answer to that question is.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the\n","Red Berets.\n","--- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.\n","--- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the\n","technical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary\n","resulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected\n","witness.\n","Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey\n","\n","\n","\n","Wolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also\n","mentioned.  Now, the witness, I don't know whether he was protected or\n","not, I don't want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the\n","transcript says that he saw 20 locals, and it's about Samac, wearing\n","uniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed\n","they were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned\n","to Samac.  Do you know anything about that?\n","A.   Well, I don't have any information to that effect, and that is\n","quite impossible.  I'd like to point out once again that in different\n","places they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had\n","found some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have\n","been various units, especially as we're talking about locals in this\n","particular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What\n","does it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some\n","warehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they\n","were some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the\n","Red Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of\n","the State Security in 1996.\n","So quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term\n","applies to different concepts.\n","Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I\n","think that is in the indictment against you but you'll put me right if I'm\n","wrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,\n","that is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,\n","wherein amongst others you said:  \"Dear brother Chetniks, especially you\n","\n","\n","\n","across the Drina, you're the bravest, and we're going to clear up Bosnia\n","from the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong.\"  Is\n","it true that you said that?\n","A.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and\n","partially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,\n","because -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don't always know\n","the Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an\n","artificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the\n","Croats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian\n","variation \"pogan\" means \"pagan,\" where as in the Serb language \"pogan\"\n","means \"waste\" or \"faeces.\"  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and\n","pan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called\n","them \"pogani,\" which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the\n","Muslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I'm not a stupid\n","man.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have\n","nothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more\n","than I do to all the Christians afterwards, let's make that point clear,\n","but I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --\n","greatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims\n","to be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.\n","So here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion\n","is being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,\n","and I've been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,\n","Islamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they\n","first appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.\n","\n","\n","\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.  Well, if you\n","haven't got if it in my books then the Prosecution probably has a copy\n","because most of my speeches were published in my books, in my works so, if\n","a speech does not happen to be there, if --\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Was this one published in your books?  I apologise.\n","I haven't read them all.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson [sic], two years ago I\n","handed over to The Hague Tribunal 80 of my printed works.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Is this speech in any of them?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Most probably, but it would be up to\n","the Prosecution to find it, not me.  I can't look through that whole\n","matter myself, because I didn't make the statement only in one place.  I\n","made the statement in several places, on several occasions.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Well, normally the party presenting the evidence is\n","responsible for getting it to court in some -- as official as is possible,\n","but you're not aware of a copy of it being available for us as part of the\n","papers in connection with your evidence.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Bonomy, the side that has\n","referred to my alleged speech is the Prosecution's side.  So I'm just\n","telling you where they made a mistake.  So they can find the original of\n","the speech and present it here.  I can't do the work of the Prosecution.\n","I can't be expected to do that.  I am testifying to the facts and\n","circumstances about which I have knowledge.  I'm not here to help the\n","\n","\n","\n","Prosecution out in its work.  And for my part, I have contributed\n","sufficiently by handing over all my books.  They have far greater\n","resources than I do.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Nice, can you help?  Where do I locate the\n","evidence, readily locate the evidence in relation to this?\n","MR. NICE:  I'm not sure you can locate it readily at the moment\n","from our own database.  It may be possible.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  It appears Mr. Seselj is suggesting that there is\n","evidence of this speech led by the Prosecution in this case.\n","MR. NICE:  It may be in this case or it may be in the pre-trial\n","brief of his own case.  I'll deal with it as soon as I can.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  All right.  Thank you.\n","MR. NICE:  We can't of course be guided in the way we are going to\n","present our questions through his observations.  We'll make our own\n","decisions.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  No, no, no.  That's nothing to the point.  I'm just\n","trying to clarify where I can read this speech, but if no one's going to\n","help me, that's okay.\n","MR. NICE:  We certainly will help you when we can.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Witness B1643 who testified pursuant to 92 bis, I assume you know\n","the written part, mentioned torture and capture of civilians in the SUP\n","building of the Territorial Defence in the primary school and secondary\n","school in Crkvina, the warehouse there.  Do you know anything about that?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   Well, I already mentioned something about this.  I said that the\n","Crkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey\n","Wolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was\n","arrested, but I don't have any details about how the trial proceeded and\n","the upshot.  I asked my legal advisors to find the complete dossier of\n","that trial, but I do know for certain that he was arrested and taken to\n","trial in Banja Luka, prosecuted in Banja Luka.\n","Q.   The indictment against you, in the indictment you are accused of\n","an act on the 7th of May, 1992, which allegedly happened there which says\n","that two leaders of your group under your command killed 18 males at the\n","agricultural farm in Crkvina.  Is that the event you are referring to?\n","A.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn't there\n","nor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical\n","Party.\n","Q.   That's all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your\n","answer suffices.\n","You are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when\n","allegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated\n","killed 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating\n","on the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was\n","quoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.\n","So it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this\n","question of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that\n","\n","\n","\n","concept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he\n","stands accused, because he's testifying here.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily\n","relevant for that purpose.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I'm not going to\n","insist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993\n","some members of your alleged --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have\n","continued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not\n","see at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial\n","here.  I know that he's alleged to be a member of the joint criminal\n","enterprise.  I'm well aware of that.  But that doesn't let in any and all\n","kind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see\n","here that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,\n","then that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren't true\n","either, and he has refuted a number of witnesses' statements here that I\n","quoted.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know\n","you know that.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, witness William Thomas Francis Roy on page 28882 of\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the transcript stated here that the Muslim snipers killed three pregnant\n","women and only then did the Serb snipers respond by opening fire.  Do you\n","know anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked\n","to killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?\n","A.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire\n","in Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front\n","line stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part\n","under Muslim control and another part under Serb control.\n","Now, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind\n","the following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from\n","rifles which wasn't a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because\n","sniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with\n","optic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the\n","Serb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to\n","come by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black\n","market.  I don't exclude the possibility of individual cases there being\n","the need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was\n","opened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain\n","control of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two\n","sides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn't\n","change for many years, and one or the other side would take control of\n","certain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.\n","On the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional\n","killing of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims\n","killed about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,\n","\n","\n","\n","in Kazani and so on.\n","Q.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the\n","Sarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present\n","on both sides.  Is that true?\n","A.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in\n","Sarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The\n","real snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far\n","more than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more\n","sophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more\n","favourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I've forgotten the evidence which I\n","think there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How\n","much personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the\n","conflict there.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to\n","the Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that\n","is.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.\n","At Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and\n","I met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh\n","shipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my\n","colleagues from university and also people whom I'd been to school with,\n","Muslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire\n","going on?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my\n","\n","\n","\n","stay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some\n","dangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you\n","had to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but\n","there were no more serious conflicts at that time.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,\n","referred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on\n","page 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs\n","fired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in\n","Sarajevo?\n","A.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open\n","fire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be\n","ascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused\n","protected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction\n","from the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo\n","they would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at\n","Serb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off\n","in the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,\n","then they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at\n","hospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,\n","who were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the\n","hospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw\n","quickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived\n","they didn't come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening\n","\n","\n","\n","fire in retaliation.\n","Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited\n","Bijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --\n","page 8258 of Alija Gusalic's -- 18258, and I link this up with your\n","indictment and Alija Gusalic's testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina\n","and members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to\n","takeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?\n","A.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite\n","correct.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just\n","nonsense.\n","Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there\n","were Arkan's men and Seselj's men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything\n","about that?\n","A.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb\n","Radical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I'm absolutely certain\n","of that.\n","Q.   The same witness says on page 18260, \"Seselj's men had beards and\n","cockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to\n","distribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party.\"\n","A.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb\n","Radical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly\n","clean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not\n","bring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot\n","be synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for\n","ideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was\n","\n","\n","\n","not a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier\n","having a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not\n","distribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role\n","in these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.\n","Members of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but\n","exclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.\n","Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now\n","I'm asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were\n","not Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were\n","held at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you\n","know anything about that?\n","A.   I don't know about those particular localities, but I've already\n","talked about Mauzer's and Arkan's conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for\n","that reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often\n","attacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.\n","Q.   I'm sorry that I didn't draw your attention to this on time,\n","Mr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you\n","are being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in\n","Batkovic.\n","A.   I've already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb\n","Radical Party there.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic\n","testified here, and he made those assertions here, and I'm linking that up\n","with --\n","\n","\n","\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness\n","made the allegations here.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp\n","near Bijeljina.  And I've linked that up to what the indictment against\n","Mr. Seselj says.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that's not relevant.  Move on.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused\n","Mr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a\n","hundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it's not relevant to\n","this case.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the\n","basis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks\n","about Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in\n","Mr. Seselj's indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane\n","treatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in\n","Seselj's indictment?\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the\n","International Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything\n","about this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?\n","A.   I don't know anything about the visit of the International Red\n","\n","\n","\n","Cross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.\n","Also, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of\n","prisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not\n","take part in any such thing.\n","As for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and\n","if there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would\n","have to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.\n","Q.   All right.  I'm not going to ask you about this anymore.  You\n","mentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is\n","that right?\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the\n","activity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the\n","situation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,\n","do you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?\n","A.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no\n","paramilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in\n","Mostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,\n","from the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical\n","Party were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them\n","as highly disciplined on Belgrade television.\n","If there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have\n","been members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention\n","platoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not\n","preclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this\n","\n","\n","\n","was not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.\n","Q.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp\n","there were Seselj's Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;\n","transcript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?\n","A.   That is absolutely impossible.  I've never heard of the White\n","Eagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven't heard of this Buna\n","camp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","Party, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared\n","in Buna.  I don't know anything about this, but there should be proper\n","records to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White\n","Eagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any\n","Red Berets.\n","Q.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in\n","Nevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?\n","A.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I\n","was in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and\n","in the Neretva valley.\n","Q.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?\n","A.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in\n","Nevesinje.\n","Q.   That will do.\n","A.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable\n","number of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no\n","conflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large\n","number of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they\n","\n","\n","\n","were put up at various facilities there.\n","Q.   Do you know anything about a lake, Boracko Jezero, and a rest\n","house there where about 19 persons were killed, according to the\n","allegations made?\n","A.   I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers\n","of the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That's close to\n","Konjic.  I've already said that there were members of the Serb guard\n","there.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was\n","there, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was\n","operating.\n","Q.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan's Serb\n","volunteer guard?\n","A.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.\n","Q.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?\n","A.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared\n","elsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities\n","had a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because\n","they stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then\n","they appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a\n","lot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic's.  As far as I\n","know, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj --\n","A.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav\n","Lajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.\n","Q.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   The Serb guard.\n","Q.   Of Vuk Draskovic?\n","A.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from\n","Novi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made\n","to the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.  I've forgotten\n","his first name.\n","A.   Jovan.\n","Q.   Jovan Dulovic who testified here.  Mr. Robinson instructed me to\n","find the original documents that can be linked up to your submissions\n","since they refused to admit your submissions.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I am sorry, Mr. Robinson.  If you're\n","telling me to have copies made I will do that, but I've just received\n","these copies.  This is a series of photocopies of articles written by\n","Jovan Dulovic and published in Ekspres Politika from the 16th of November,\n","the 26th of November, all of that in 1991.  Then the 18th of November, the\n","2nd of November.  So from November 1991.\n","In these articles, he speaks very favourably of the JNA and\n","commends their behaviour in the fighting around Vukovar.  For example, he\n","says that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats, saw the light of\n","the day after having stayed in cellars for many --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, what is the question?\n","MR. NICE:  And, Your Honour, if I may interrupt, if there's going\n","to be a reference to and quotation from a newspaper article, it has to be\n","on the overhead projector.  It then has to be available to us to read it\n","\n","\n","\n","in full should we wish to.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's -- that's the practice, Mr. Milosevic.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, since I have only one copy of these articles and I've\n","just received that, could the usher please place them on the ELMO, and\n","then you can have a look at least at some of the parts that have been\n","marked.  Reference is made to Major Sljivancanin here, too, in a very\n","favourable light.  Gratitude for assistance to civilians, Croats, at that,\n","and so on and so forth.  Please look at this series of articles.\n","In order to answer my question, are these at least partly articles\n","that you relied on when you wrote those submissions to the other side\n","about the untruthful testimony of Jovan Dulovic or, rather, the difference\n","in -- between his reporting then and his testimony here about Vukovar?\n","MR. NICE:  Your Honour, that was a leading but nevertheless it's\n","interesting to see what the articles actually say.  And if it becomes\n","relevant to consider their admissibility as evidence, I know the Chamber\n","will have in mind its open recent ruling in respect of the documents of\n","Jasovic and the potential evidential value or not as evidence of these\n","documents, but I'm most interested frankly in seeing what they actually\n","say.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let's get it on the overhead projector.\n","There appears to be a technical problem.  We're not seeing\n","anything.\n","Mr. Milosevic, the technician is being called.  He's coming in.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","So move on to another question.  We'll come back to this.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am sorry, but my\n","next question also has to do with something that Mr. Seselj already\n","testified about and the document that I obtained in the meantime and that\n","would also have to be placed on the ELMO.  That is --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,\n","because the overhead projector is not working.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further\n","questions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except\n","for this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a\n","decision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were\n","presented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal\n","government said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was\n","known who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.\n","The 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.  So it is about\n","40 days after the coup d'etat of the 5th of October, 2000.  It was then\n","that they were all released, set free.\n","So wanted to show you this document, and I wanted to hand out\n","copies to you.  I've just received this.  They are all in the Serbian\n","language but they can be placed on the ELMO to show what the government\n","spokesman had said was completely disregarded, and these persons mentioned\n","in the criminal report against Erdemovic were set free.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  The ELMO is working now, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, please take a look at this.  This is a series of\n","\n","\n","\n","articles from Ekspres Politika.  Can you see the date of the newspaper?\n","A.   It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of\n","November.\n","Q.   1991; right?\n","A.   1991.\n","Q.   Unless this is a leading question.\n","A.   It's illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one\n","of the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when\n","preparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.\n","That is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of\n","Evidence and Procedure.\n","Q.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the\n","subheading?\n","A.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both\n","Serbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars\n","for a long time.  \"Light finally,\" is the heading.  And then in the\n","subheading:  \"Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas.\"  And then there's\n","another bit saying, \"In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,\"\n","and then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, \"I cannot believe\n","that we are alive,\" and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated\n","the town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.\n","THE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of\n","the question was not heard by the interpreters.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.  The interpreters have\n","indicated that you're overlapping and so she did not hear the beginning of\n","\n","\n","\n","the last question.  Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","And please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.\n","Perhaps it's easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text\n","is.\n","A.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as\n","follows:  \"A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total\n","of 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity.\"\n","That's what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and\n","Croats equally.  Civilians, that is.\n","I can't read the first paragraph because it's quite illegible, but\n","it seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,\n","that several ambulances were waiting to help.  \"It would not be a good\n","thing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now.\"\n","So Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of\n","Vukovar before the fighting had stopped.\n","Q.   Can you see the subtitle which says \"The cruel major\"?\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this\n","refers to and what it says about this cruel major.\n","A.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians\n","very nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that\n","surprised this Croat woman, and he says:  \"No knows what she as a Croat\n","heard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers.\"  So he's describing the\n","\n","\n","\n","behaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what\n","Croatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very\n","bad way.\n","And then Major Sljivancanin says:  \"Whenever you need anything,\n","look for me and I'll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to\n","go, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full\n","of gratitude.\"  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  \"He had\n","followed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude.\"\n","All this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now\n","Colonel Veselin Sljivancanin.\n","Q.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic\n","describes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, \"Take this\n","child to hospital immediately.\"\n","A.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, \"Take this child to the\n","hospital in Negoslavci right away,\" Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing\n","the ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  \"Let her be given\n","assistance and medicine.\"\n","A little later Vlatka's mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for\n","her daughter in the crowd.  \"Where is my child?  What have they done to\n","her?  Where have they taken her,\" Verica was crying out.\n","\"Don't be afraid.  She is in hospital,\" Sljivancanin said.  The\n","frightened woman didn't believe it.\"  This is followed by Dulovic's\n","comment:  \"Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA\n","soldiers.\"\n","Q.   And what does it say then?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   \"Get into my car.  I'll take you to the hospital so you can see\n","your child and reassure yourself that everything is all right.  They both\n","entered the vehicle.  In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and\n","dressed Vlatka's wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the\n","daughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them.\"\n","Q.   So this is Dulovic's report from the Vukovar war theatre.\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on\n","the following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points\n","are.  This large title, this heading, that is.\n","A.   Yes.  Now it's been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a\n","statement, \"I believed in the army.\"  And what's in the subtitle.  \"A\n","little less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in\n","Vukovar.\"  And then there's a quotation.\n","A.   \"We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the\n","guards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the\n","hospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims.\"\n","Q.   And look what it says in the article.\n","A.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the\n","following:  \"In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and\n","barricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house\n","number 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,\n","Milos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.  A few days\n","later, the members of the guards burst into the cellar.  These were\n","members of the Croatian National Guard Corps.  Get out or we'll throw a\n","\n","\n","\n","bomb in.  The Chetniks are coming.  They're cutting everyone's throats.\n","We're taking you to a shelter.\"\n","Q.   It's quite illegible.  Could you put some light on it?\n","Look at the passages marked in yellow.  You don't have to read it\n","all out, just a few passages.\n","A.    \"Several of us -- or, rather, above us on the cemetery the guards\n","members were stationed.  Milka Vidovic said, 'When they visited us in the\n","cellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone's throats.  We\n","Serbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the\n","only thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.  I\n","believed in our army and I believed they would arrive.'\"\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  What's the question in relation to this,\n","Mr. Milosevic?\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, what is the signature marked in yellow here?\n","A.   Jovan Dulovic.  The same Jovan Dulovic who four or five years\n","later changed his version by -- he turned around by 180 degrees because he\n","has become a mercenary of the Western intelligence services, and he writes\n","for the magazine Vreme which is the Belgrade branch of Western\n","intelligence agencies.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, when you glanced through this article and you dealt\n","with it in your submission, is there a single word here which does not\n","speak favourably of the JNA and the people who fought in Vukovar?\n","A.   No.  The texts are all exceptionally favourable, full of praise\n","for the soldiers and officers of the JNA during the fighting for Vukovar.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   Would you look at the next page, please.  Let's just see what the\n","date is.\n","A.   The 18th, I suppose.  The 18th of November.\n","Q.   Well, move on.  Move on.\n","A.   Mr. Milosevic, Dulovic says here one day with volunteers and tank\n","crews in the street fighting for the liberation of Vukovar.  He praises\n","the volunteers who participated in the fighting for Vukovar as part of the\n","JNA.  So this should be noted.\n","Next page, please.  I think that it's very important to point this\n","out.\n","Q.   And the signature is Jovan Dulovic.  What's the title of this\n","article?\n","A.   The title of this article is \"The Knights of Vukovar.\"\n","Q.   And who does it refer to?\n","A.   The units of Major Borivoje Tesic on the front line in Vukovar.\n","Major Borivoje Tesic I think -- says: \"I think this is the last stage of\n","the fighting.  Crews carrying out their tasks successfully and the help of\n","brave people is indispensable.\"  It speaks of Croatian Ustasha and so on.\n","Q.   Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?\n","A.   Yes.\n","JUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic\n","said volunteers as part of JNA.  Could you show us the passage where\n","Mr. Dulovic said so?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He says here:  \"One day with\n","volunteers and tank crews in the street fighting for the liberation of\n","\n","\n","\n","Vukovar.\"  This is above the headline.\n","Then he goes on to say:  \"Speaking favourably of Stanko Vujanovic,\n","he says the commander of the 1st Company of the Territorial Defence of\n","Vukovar who is said to be a man who knows no fear.\" It's quite difficult\n","to read this.  My eyesight is not so good and this is not very legible.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Can it be enlarged?\n","A.   \"With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making\n","openings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze\n","through and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.

And what does it say in this last passage?\n","A.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- \"The inhabitants of the\n","Crepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,\n","who with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village\n","and one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the\n","highest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages.\"\n","Q.   And he was killed?\n","A.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives\n","him.  Next page.\n","Q.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a\n","look?  I haven't had time to look at it all carefully.\n","A.   Yes.  There's a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of\n","November.  \"Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate\n","Vukovar.\"\n","In these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate\n","Vukovar, and five years later he's saying something completely different.\n","\"Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in\n","Vukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb.\"  And then it\n","says:  \"The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back,\" and so on\n","and so forth.\n","So this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the\n","JNA.\n","Q.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It's been circled.\n","A.   Yes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   Very well.\n","A.   The 4th of November, 1991.  \"For two days fierce fighting has not\n","stopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in\n","flames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of\n","Njusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the\n","Territorial Defence.  Advances by Territorial Defence units and volunteers\n","from the direction of Trpinja stopped on the edge of Borovo Naselje.\"\n","He then speaks of a Croatian mortar attack on Bobota [phoen] and\n","so on.\n","Q.   Is this another report by Dulovic?\n","A.   Yes, it's signed by Jovan Dulovic.\n","Q.   Is there anything else, any other report?\n","A.   I'm looking at another text here but I can't see whether it's by\n","Dulovic or not because it's not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian\n","volunteer guard but again a very favourable text.  I couldn't see -- I\n","can't see the name of the author here.  I can't see it on this page.\n","Q.   Is there anything else underneath, another report?\n","A.   \"Who are the volunteers,\" is the next title.\n","Q.   Well, I can't see anything anymore.\n","A.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced\n","through the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is \"Through the holes\n","to the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?\n","Unknown ammunition with inhumane bullets.\"\n","What happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used\n","weapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds\n","\n","\n","\n","because the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal\n","organs.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, I can't see what it says here in yellow, highlighted\n","in yellow.\n","A.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It's Major Radic now\n","who also stands accused in The Hague.  \"Throughout the month of October,\n","the fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in\n","the clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least\n","one person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja\n","[phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in\n","that way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had\n","taken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.\n","The snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own\n","control and then a solution was found to move through the houses.\"\n","Q.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic's article\n","again?\n","A.   Well, it's not legible but it is a series of articles by him.  We\n","can't find a signature here but quite obviously it is a series of articles\n","by him.\n","Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  Is that a series of articles to which you\n","referred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect\n","to Dulovic's testimony?\n","A.   Yes.  But this isn't the complete material.  My legal advisors\n","found many more texts of this kind and they quote them in extenso, and in\n","my submission I state my intention to disclose them in keeping with\n","\n","\n","\n","Rule 67 of the rules of evidence.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, I have one more question\n","[as interpreted] -- Robinson, I have a question for you.  As my associates\n","have managed to come by a set of these or at least photocopies of the\n","papers from 1991 which Mr. Seselj refers to in his submission to the other\n","side, the presentation of these photocopies, is that sufficient grounds\n","for my request that they be accepted as exhibits, that Mr. Seselj's\n","submission be accepted as an exhibit?\n","MR. NICE:  Rather interesting issues, I think, arise on the\n","validity of these documents as exhibits, and it may be necessary to go\n","back and remind ourselves of what Mr. Dulovic himself said about these\n","matters.

[Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some\n","<P>22    questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian\n","<P>23    indictment, that have to do with the \"Rump Presidency\" as it's called\n","<P>24    here.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  \"The Rump Presidency\n","<P>25    carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies,\" and so on and so forth, \"had\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    effect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief.\"\n","<P> 2            I'm not going to ask you to repeat what you've already said, but\n","<P> 3    in relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of\n","<P> 4    Serbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they\n","<P> 5    not take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency\n","<P> 6    of the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any\n","<P> 7    objective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from\n","<P> 8    carrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?\n","<P> 9            The question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,\n","<P>10    Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the\n","<P>11    SFRY Presidency in Belgrade?\n","<P>12       A.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,\n","<P>13    staying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was\n","<P>14    never a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from\n","<P>15    carrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped\n","<P>16    coming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had\n","<P>17    practically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe\n","<P>18    Mesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying\n","<P>19    that they could not come because they could not strike a balance in\n","<P>20    relation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and\n","<P>21    Montenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.\n","<P>22            The representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were\n","<P>23    not expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was\n","<P>24    actually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display\n","<P>25    such feelings at the time.  It's only when he left Belgrade and when he\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    came back to the Croatian parliament that he said, \"I've completed my\n","<P> 2    duty.  Yugoslavia is no more.\"\n","<P> 3            He pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.\n","<P> 4    Also, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him\n","<P> 5    sufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he\n","<P> 6    condemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most\n","<P> 7    cooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was\n","<P> 8    what he was.\n","<P> 9            I already said that according to the constitution of the then\n","<P>10    Yugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one\n","<P>11    single member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been\n","<P>12    prevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could\n","<P>13    have gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could\n","<P>14    have refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the\n","<P>15    Presidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the\n","<P>16    Presidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed\n","<P>17    within the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably\n","<P>18    before Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a\n","<P>19    Rump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of\n","<P>20    a rump Presidency.\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>23       Q.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  \"Slobodan Milosevic,\n","<P>24    in his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that\n","<P>25    Yugoslavia was finished.\"\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            Please, you've got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I'm not\n","<P> 2    going to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much\n","<P> 3    time.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to\n","<P> 4    here or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that\n","<P> 5    Yugoslavia was finished?\n","<P> 6       A.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say\n","<P> 7    that Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you\n","<P> 8    never said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I\n","<P> 9    remember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the\n","<P>10    behaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went\n","<P>11    through a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,\n","<P>12    constitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,\n","<P>13    but then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional\n","<P>14    provision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases\n","<P>15    to exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the\n","<P>16    matter.\n","<P>17            The leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never\n","<P>18    did it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and\n","<P>19    Croatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and\n","<P>20    Macedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro\n","<P>21    proclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting\n","<P>22    of two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration\n","<P>23    on your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   \"In March 1991 the collective Presidency of the SFRY reached a\n","<P> 2    deadlock on several issues.\"  That is paragraph 56.\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... that sentence\n","<P> 4    which is at the beginning of the paragraph.  There's another allegation in\n","<P> 5    that last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no\n","<P> 6    longer be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask\n","<P> 7    Mr. Seselj whether that is so.\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember\n","<P> 9    at that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian\n","<P>10    public, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the\n","<P>11    decisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that\n","<P>12    Serbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation\n","<P>13    when the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.\n","<P>14            I would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there\n","<P>15    was a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the\n","<P>16    headquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long\n","<P>17    debate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the\n","<P>18    demand of the military to declare a state of emergency.\n","<P>19            The top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the\n","<P>20    behaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a\n","<P>21    vote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.  As far as I can\n","<P>22    remember --\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You have answered the question I asked, thanks.\n","<P>24            Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>25            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   That is what is referred to here.  It says the representatives on\n","<P> 2    the Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,\n","<P> 3    the autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of\n","<P> 4    Kosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what\n","<P> 5    was so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the\n","<P> 6    Presidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?\n","<P> 7       A.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also\n","<P> 8    start the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven't got the document here\n","<P> 9    so I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were\n","<P>10    actually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already\n","<P>11    started putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the\n","<P>12    Presidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the\n","<P>13    Presidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not\n","<P>14    very constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the\n","<P>15    Presidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,\n","<P>16    or Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.\n","<P>17    I think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been\n","<P>18    recalled in the meantime.\n","<P>19       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that\n","<P>20    session or before that session or in relation to that session I never\n","<P>21    declared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did\n","<P>22    they declare that Yugoslavia was finished?\n","<P>23       A.   I've already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian\n","<P>24    politicians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was\n","<P>25    one of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    hard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.\n","<P> 2            As for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in\n","<P> 3    Montenegro either.\n","<P> 4       Q.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to\n","<P> 5    normal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic\n","<P> 6    was elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented\n","<P> 7    Vojvodina at the time.\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the\n","<P> 9    Presidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started\n","<P>10    working again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its\n","<P>11    work.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of\n","<P>12    Bosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil\n","<P>13    Tupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new\n","<P>14    crisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be\n","<P>15    elected president of the Presidency.\n","<P>16            There was a principle involved that the president of the\n","<P>17    Presidency was elected from a different republican province every year but\n","<P>18    nobody's election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic\n","<P>19    did not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European\n","<P>20    envoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to\n","<P>21    elect him nevertheless.\n","<P>22       Q.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?\n","<P>23       A.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting\n","<P>24    the preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from\n","<P>25    those positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says\n","<P> 2    that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and\n","<P> 3    discussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between\n","<P> 4    Serbia and Croatia?\n","<P> 5       A.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I\n","<P> 6    remember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what\n","<P> 7    was skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching\n","<P> 8    agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the\n","<P> 9    Bosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a\n","<P>10    situation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it\n","<P>11    increasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the\n","<P>12    country at the time.\n","<P>13            At that time, I -- as I've already said, the presidents of the\n","<P>14    presidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys\n","<P>15    had actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach\n","<P>16    agreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia\n","<P>17    increasingly so.\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through\n","<P>19    what medium?\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully\n","<P>21    being bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media\n","<P>22    this kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were\n","<P>23    already at that time being financed from the West by different Western\n","<P>24    intelligence agencies, so that's the kind of media I'm talking about.  In\n","<P>25    Belgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    federal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic\n","<P> 2    government, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government\n","<P> 3    in Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the\n","<P> 4    Western powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante\n","<P> 5    Markovic's government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible\n","<P> 6    agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia\n","<P> 7    together under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been\n","<P> 8    eliminated.\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>11       Q.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at\n","<P>12    one stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence\n","<P>13    counsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest\n","<P>14    collaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This\n","<P>15    denies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of\n","<P>16    Bosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted\n","<P>17    into evidence and if not we will find this transcript.\n","<P>18            However, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with\n","<P>19    you as you were an active participant in all political events.  This\n","<P>20    meeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the\n","<P>21    division of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any\n","<P>22    member of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning\n","<P>23    of which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way\n","<P>24    even indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?\n","<P>25       A.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    if Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia\n","<P> 2    as an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as\n","<P> 3    a constituent nation as they had been before in the previous\n","<P> 4    constitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the\n","<P> 5    first president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it\n","<P> 6    was not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint\n","<P> 7    state.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans\n","<P> 8    persuaded him to call off the agreement.\n","<P> 9       Q.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It\n","<P>10    says:  \"On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY\n","<P>11    Presidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,\n","<P>12    Sejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY\n","<P>13    Presidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the\n","<P>14    Presidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and\n","<P>15    Macedonia.\"\n","<P>16            On the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.  Was this\n","<P>17    a kind of takeover of the function of the Presidency or were these\n","<P>18    functions being carried out by the legal representatives?\n","<P>19       A.   There was absolutely no takeover.  When four of the members of the\n","<P>20    Presidency withdrew and some of them officially gave notice that they were\n","<P>21    no longer members, like Drnovsek, for instance, while others simply\n","<P>22    stopped attending the sessions.  The Presidency continued working with the\n","<P>23    members who -- whom it was possible to gather together.\n","<P>24            I suggest that the Chamber get hold of this piece of legislation.\n","<P>25    I cannot quote it verbatim right now, but I'm absolutely sure it existed.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    And according to this piece of legislation, even if the majority of\n","<P> 2    members could not meet, the Presidency under certain circumstances would\n","<P> 3    continue working with the members who were present.\n","<P> 4            Let me remind you that in the spring of 1991 or in the early\n","<P> 5    summer, there was a vote taken to declare a imminent threat of war.\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 65 it says:  \"On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,\n","<P> 7    Slobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal\n","<P> 8    enterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from\n","<P> 9    Belgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the\n","<P>10    mobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay\n","<P>11    in Yugoslavia.\"\n","<P>12            First of all, let's establish when I began advocating a unitary\n","<P>13    Serb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And\n","<P>14    secondly, was this anyone's idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,\n","<P>15    and is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever\n","<P>16    been a unitary state?\n","<P>17       A.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally\n","<P>19    and your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt\n","<P>20    the new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the\n","<P>21    autonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the\n","<P>22    Serb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of\n","<P>23    autonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an\n","<P>24    option.\n","<P>25            Furthermore, when the four former federal units had already been\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    recognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the\n","<P> 2    Montenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be\n","<P> 3    promulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump\n","<P> 4    Yugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would\n","<P> 5    have been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -\n","<P> 6    because that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary\n","<P> 7    Serbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this\n","<P> 8    but didn't want to, and I am sorry that you didn't do that, because up to\n","<P> 9    the point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --\n","<P>10    in Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It\n","<P>11    appeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.\n","<P>12       Q.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any\n","<P>13    of my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who\n","<P>14    were allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had\n","<P>15    any kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?\n","<P>16       A.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated\n","<P>17    with you advocated such an idea.\n","<P>18       Q.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it\n","<P>19    says here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of\n","<P>20    reservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the\n","<P>21    reasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was\n","<P>22    called for?\n","<P>23       A.   I'm not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation\n","<P>24    of reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to\n","<P>25    mobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    to take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the\n","<P> 2    territorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that\n","<P> 3    this mobilisation didn't go well.  The response was very poor, because\n","<P> 4    Veljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn't want to remove the\n","<P> 5    communist insignia from the military uniforms.\n","<P> 6            The Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the\n","<P> 7    Presidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was\n","<P> 8    Prime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in\n","<P> 9    Slovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of\n","<P>10    such an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops\n","<P>11    into Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then\n","<P>12    leadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as\n","<P>13    I know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership\n","<P>14    which had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.\n","<P>15       Q.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your\n","<P>16    name, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask\n","<P>17    you now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of\n","<P>18    April, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan's and\n","<P>19    Seselj's men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you\n","<P>20    know anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and\n","<P>21    cart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of\n","<P>22    cooperation with Arkan's volunteer guard?\n","<P>23       A.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","<P>24    did not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert\n","<P>25    that, I'm saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    organised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as\n","<P> 2    much as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.\n","<P> 3    That's a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb\n","<P> 4    Radical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty\n","<P> 5    to Serbia.  I guarantee that.\n","<P> 6            The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict\n","<P> 7    instructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb\n","<P> 8    volunteer guard up to the --\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm asking why was that instruction given to the\n","<P>10    volunteers of the Serb Radical Party?\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.\n","<P>12    We didn't want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn't\n","<P>13    want people's awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.\n","<P>14            As I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,\n","<P>15    long before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had\n","<P>16    quarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was\n","<P>17    in danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this\n","<P>18    in the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding\n","<P>20    that instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with\n","<P>21    Arkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You're\n","<P>22    not there with them.\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can't say that not a single\n","<P>24    volunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There's one\n","<P>25    instance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    teacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical\n","<P> 2    Party.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of\n","<P> 3    about 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back\n","<P> 4    but, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of\n","<P> 5    Arkan's men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.\n","<P> 6            So, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint\n","<P> 7    military activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with\n","<P> 8    Arkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a\n","<P> 9    distance from Arkan.\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.\n","<P>11            Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>13       Q.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on\n","<P>14    transcript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia\n","<P>15    took place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj's\n","<P>16    White Eagles.\n","<P>17            First of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and\n","<P>18    secondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj's White Eagles?\n","<P>19       A.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb\n","<P>20    people organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have\n","<P>21    already said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of\n","<P>22    volunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After\n","<P>23    that, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we\n","<P>24    had volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never\n","<P>25    had anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            There was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo\n","<P> 2    Selo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he\n","<P> 3    was killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not\n","<P> 4    carrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no\n","<P> 5    joint military activities.\n","<P> 6       Q.   Let's clarify this.  It doesn't say here that you cooperated.  It\n","<P> 7    says here:  \"With infiltration of Seselj's White Eagles.\"  So the White\n","<P> 8    Eagles are being ascribed to you.\n","<P> 9       A.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the\n","<P>10    Prosecutor bringing witnesses here who don't no anything about what\n","<P>11    happened on the ground.  It's simply nonsense to talk of a group called\n","<P>12    Seselj's White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and\n","<P>13    the Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn't know\n","<P>14    what he was talking about.\n","<P>15       Q.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,\n","<P>16    2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that \"Seselj collected men in\n","<P>17    Erdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia.\"  Is that\n","<P>18    true, Mr. Seselj?\n","<P>19            JUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493\n","<P>20    who testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake\n","<P>22    in my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that\n","<P>23    particular page, and the page is 19003.\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    them to Bosnia?\n","<P> 2       A.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in\n","<P> 3    Erdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,\n","<P> 4    nicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only\n","<P> 5    time.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --\n","<P> 6    we never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there\n","<P> 7    either, and I can state that quite categorically.\n","<P> 8            The people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the\n","<P> 9    war and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were\n","<P>10    exclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I\n","<P>11    absolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan's centre in Erdut\n","<P>12    later on.  We never had anything to do with it.\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is\n","<P>14    20294, says that Arkan's and Seselj's men shot above the heads of the\n","<P>15    civilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in\n","<P>16    Bratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who\n","<P>17    mistreated and abused the civilians?\n","<P>18       A.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian\n","<P>19    Radical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my\n","<P>20    knowledge Arkan didn't appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in\n","<P>21    Zvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in\n","<P>22    Bratunac either.  And I've already said that in Bratunac there was\n","<P>23    Deronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there\n","<P>24    I was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have\n","<P>25    very certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj's men were\n","<P> 2    in Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj's\n","<P> 3    mean there is no difference, says he.\n","<P> 4       A.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can't see any\n","<P> 5    difference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the\n","<P> 6    White Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at\n","<P> 7    all.  And that's not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some\n","<P> 8    judgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to\n","<P> 9    see in some other places Seselj's White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the\n","<P>10    problem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses\n","<P>11    which it manipulates.\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on\n","<P>13    several occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven't been able to check this myself\n","<P>15    because the accused hasn't been getting the references correct, and it's\n","<P>16    quite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I'm grateful to\n","<P>17    Ms. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came\n","<P>18    (redacted).\n","<P>19    But, really, I'm afraid we've got to have correct references for the\n","<P>20    witnesses.  We can't simply just go to the page in the transcript.\n","<P>21    Frequently our page numbers don't necessarily coincide here in court, and\n","<P>22    without reference to the witnesses it's very difficult to pick it up\n","<P>23    later.\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in\n","<P>25    pinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you're referring.  Now,\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Judge Kwon has already corrected you once, and apparently there is another\n","<P> 2    mistake in the reference.\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, perhaps there might be a\n","<P> 4    mistake with the name, but there is no mistake with the quotation from the\n","<P> 5    transcript, and my question relates to the material facts which are being\n","<P> 6    mentioned here.\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, we have to follow it, Mr. Milosevic.  There\n","<P> 8    is duty on you to be more careful.\n","<P> 9            Please proceed.\n","<P>10            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. Robinson.  And I'll\n","<P>11    check this out to see whether indeed it is the same witness from\n","<P>12    page 20352, the transcript line and page, the quotation that I mentioned\n","<P>13    earlier on or, rather, 20351 is the exact number.  I'll check that out\n","<P>14    during the break.\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>16       Q.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript\n","<P>17    said that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of\n","<P>18    March, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan's men took part as well as\n","<P>19    Seselj's men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the\n","<P>20    occupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on\n","<P>21    the 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of\n","<P>22    your volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?\n","<P>23       A.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What\n","<P>24    happened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between\n","<P>25    the JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Muslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.\n","<P> 2    However, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went\n","<P> 3    on for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting\n","<P> 4    the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was\n","<P> 5    there, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my\n","<P> 6    knowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of\n","<P> 7    the local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to\n","<P> 8    establish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the\n","<P> 9    ground there.\n","<P>10            I know -- have reliable information that the commands and the\n","<P>11    officers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan's and\n","<P>12    the Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a\n","<P>13    great deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very\n","<P>14    rarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.\n","<P>15            As far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,\n","<P>16    over there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did\n","<P>17    appear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the\n","<P>18    call of Biljana Plavsic.  I can't prove that, but I do know that Biljana\n","<P>19    Plavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly\n","<P>20    meeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The\n","<P>21    volunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina\n","<P>22    were not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the\n","<P>23    Serbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were\n","<P>24    residents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the\n","<P>25    conflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    and Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan's right-hand man.  And in\n","<P> 2    Serbia we didn't send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something\n","<P> 4    for me in relation to the Prosecution's case.  In the Bosnia indictment\n","<P> 5    the allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other\n","<P> 6    members of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the\n","<P> 7    Prosecution case unfolded, you're not saying, are you, that he acted\n","<P> 8    alone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with\n","<P> 9    other members of the joint criminal enterprise.\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven't reviewed each and every allegation\n","<P>11    to check that there isn't one there that may be susceptible to individual\n","<P>12    perpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he's working with others.\n","<P>14            MR. NICE:  Yes.\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually\n","<P>16    your case.  It's not that he acted alone.\n","<P>17            MR. NICE:  Subject to the point I've just made.\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you've made, yes.\n","<P>19            MR. NICE:  Yes.\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Thank you.\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>22       Q.   Very well, Mr. Seselj.  You've just heard that explanation too.\n","<P>23    Now, since you know the relationships very well between people at that\n","<P>24    time, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and\n","<P>25    Zvornik yourself.  Now, did I or any organs of power and authority have\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    anything to do with Arkan's volunteer guard?\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet.\n","<P> 3            MR. NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and\n","<P> 4    I think perhaps there's this qualification, although I don't think it is a\n","<P> 5    qualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this\n","<P> 6    accused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top\n","<P> 7    political level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are\n","<P> 8    criminal in nature.  It's the standard method of generation of\n","<P> 9    genocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar\n","<P>10    [phoen].\n","<P>11            Now, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other\n","<P>12    people.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may\n","<P>13    be minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in\n","<P>14    those circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting\n","<P>15    alone in certain circumstances, but that's the only qualification I think\n","<P>16    I should make.\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it's a point that will warrant some\n","<P>18    consideration later on, yes.\n","<P>19            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>20            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>21       Q.   So Arkan is mentioned here as well as Mauzer.  Did I or anybody\n","<P>22    else from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all\n","<P>23    and with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?\n","<P>24       A.   I'm quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.\n","<P>25    On the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    contacts with Arkan.\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many\n","<P> 3    questions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the\n","<P> 4    evidence he's giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,\n","<P> 5    how is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan\n","<P> 6    or Mauzer?\n","<P> 7            He's giving evidence.  He's saying that you had nothing to do with\n","<P> 8    him.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to\n","<P> 9    establish how he's in a position to make that statement.\n","<P>10            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>11       Q.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that\n","<P>12    cannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from\n","<P>13    the authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or\n","<P>14    relationship with Arkan or Mauzer?\n","<P>15       A.   In Belgrade you couldn't hide anything like that.  It would be\n","<P>16    impossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is\n","<P>17    that kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become\n","<P>18    public.\n","<P>19            Second, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts\n","<P>20    only with Zoran Djindjic.  And I've already spoken about the relationship\n","<P>21    between Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic's vice-president and the\n","<P>22    president of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his\n","<P>23    pre-electoral campaign.\n","<P>24       Q.   Let's clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did\n","<P>25    you have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    able to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in\n","<P> 2    Bijeljina?\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina\n","<P> 4    sufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,\n","<P> 5    including Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this\n","<P> 6    trial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events\n","<P> 7    that went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in\n","<P> 8    Bijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements\n","<P> 9    and held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and\n","<P>10    severely criticised Mauzer's conduct, especially Mauzer's conduct towards\n","<P>11    the Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am\n","<P>12    preparing them for my own trial, which doesn't seem to be starting.\n","<P>13       Q.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack\n","<P>14    on the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the\n","<P>15    JNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by\n","<P>16    the Red Berets or, rather, Arkan's and Seselj's men.  So that's the\n","<P>17    quotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan's\n","<P>18    and Seselj's men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red\n","<P>19    Berets were they?  What Arkan's men were they, Seselj's men were they\n","<P>20    around Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?\n","<P>21       A.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the\n","<P>22    witness don't seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened\n","<P>23    to see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red\n","<P>24    cap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.\n","<P>25    And then he -- the witness doesn't know whether they were Seselj's men or\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Arkan's men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it's\n","<P> 2    highly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of\n","<P> 3    his head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify\n","<P> 4    so-called Seselj's men and Arkan's men and these alleged Red Berets.\n","<P> 5            As for the Red Berets, I've already given you reliable facts about\n","<P> 6    them and said that name appeared in different situations relating to\n","<P> 7    different military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina\n","<P> 8    area where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then\n","<P> 9    the army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of\n","<P>10    the intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until\n","<P>11    the special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of\n","<P>12    Serbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this\n","<P>13    misunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed\n","<P>14    to people with -- which they had nothing to do with.\n","<P>15       Q.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the\n","<P>16    following:  \"Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia\n","<P>17    who were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done.\"\n","<P>18    That's when this witness claims.\n","<P>19       A.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He's a colonel by\n","<P>20    rank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff\n","<P>21    of the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the\n","<P>22    number two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that's the same\n","<P>23    Osman Selak that you're referring to.\n","<P>24       Q.   Well, I can't tell you that.\n","<P>25       A.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a\n","<P> 2    statement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,\n","<P> 3    what the circumstances were in which I said it.\n","<P> 4            I did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the\n","<P> 5    secession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia\n","<P> 6    seceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,\n","<P> 7    and for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he\n","<P> 8    personally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.\n","<P> 9            As far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from\n","<P>10    Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of\n","<P>11    Yugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and\n","<P>12    Raska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of\n","<P>13    examples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army\n","<P>14    perform their duty very honourably.\n","<P>15            So the citizens --\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","<P>17            JUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are\n","<P>18    saying that you did make such a statement or you didn't make such a\n","<P>19    statement.\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if\n","<P>21    you don't show me something like that here, where and when.  Let us see\n","<P>22    the statement concerned.  Let me identify it.  I gave thousands and\n","<P>23    thousands of statements in public.  They were publicly recorded.  They\n","<P>24    were published.  So let's see.\n","<P>25            My objection is precisely in that.  Why did this Osman Selak not\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    say where and when?\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's helpful to some extent.  Does it follow from\n","<P> 3    the answer you've just given that you could have said it?\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I could have said it along the\n","<P> 5    following lines, that those in the army who came from the renegade\n","<P> 6    republics in principle should not remain at positions in the Yugoslav\n","<P> 7    army.  You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live\n","<P> 8    in Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in\n","<P> 9    the army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as\n","<P>10    officers?\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's simply confusing me further.  The quote was\n","<P>12    that you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims\n","<P>13    and Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that\n","<P>14    you could possibly have made that statement in these terms?\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not saying that I made that kind\n","<P>16    of statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak\n","<P>17    testified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise\n","<P>18    lines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman\n","<P>19    Selak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be\n","<P>20    established.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the\n","<P>21    Prosecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly\n","<P>22    what I said.\n","<P>23            I am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,\n","<P>24    but it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you're asking me to do is\n","<P>25    to comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Selak's view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make\n","<P> 2    my statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.\n","<P> 3            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm\n","<P> 4    trying to understand the answer you've given to the question asked by\n","<P> 5    Mr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you've just said, the problem is\n","<P> 6    that you've been studying this yourself, and you're trying to justify a\n","<P> 7    position of your own without really dealing specifically with the question\n","<P> 8    that's being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears\n","<P> 9    now to be that you couldn't possibly have made a statement of that nature,\n","<P>10    although you might have said something much more specific about different\n","<P>11    people but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.\n","<P>12            Now, is that a fair summary of your position?\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I'm not sure, by think you're\n","<P>14    very close.  However, in order to help you, I'm going to give you an\n","<P>15    example.\n","<P>16            Throughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were\n","<P>17    informed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,\n","<P>18    escaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of\n","<P>19    confidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998\n","<P>20    we had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of\n","<P>21    the military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his\n","<P>22    family abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives\n","<P>23    there.\n","<P>24            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn't remotely sound as if it's\n","<P>25    going to be at all helpful to me, so we'll proceed with Mr. Milosevic's\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    questions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you\n","<P> 2    was about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist\n","<P> 3    statement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple\n","<P> 4    issue I'm not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further\n","<P> 5    if he wishes.\n","<P> 6            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --\n","<P> 7            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.\n","<P> 8            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in\n","<P>11    no uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that\n","<P>12    any statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never\n","<P>13    in my life have I made a racist statement.\n","<P>14            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.\n","<P>16            JUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>18       Q.   Mr. Seselj --\n","<P>19            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  There's nothing for you to respond to.\n","<P>21            Mr. Milosevic, the next question.\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>23       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I'm afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I\n","<P>24    put a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific\n","<P>25    terms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    here that \"Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia\n","<P> 2    who were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed.\"  Did you ever state\n","<P> 3    that?\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I didn't say it that way.\n","<P> 5       Q.   So you didn't say it that way --\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... matter.\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  And why on earth it should take all this time to\n","<P> 8    establish that simple issue, I do not know.\n","<P> 9            Perhaps it would help, Mr. Seselj, if you just listened to the\n","<P>10    questions and answer the question that's actually asked rather than try to\n","<P>11    make political statements about your own position.\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic --\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not making political statements,\n","<P>14    Mr. Bonomy.\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>16       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He\n","<P>17    mentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether\n","<P>18    those facts are correct.  And first of all, I'm interested in the\n","<P>19    circumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  \"Just after\n","<P>20    the bombing Seselj came to Pale.\"  And then on page 26762 he\n","<P>21    says:  \"Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to\n","<P>22    support the Bosnian Serbs.\"  These are a few facts that referred to.\n","<P>23    Could you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this\n","<P>24    actually all about?\n","<P>25       A.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Republika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the\n","<P> 2    leadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly\n","<P> 3    engaged in an anti-Serb policy.\n","<P> 4            As for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market\n","<P> 5    itself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the\n","<P> 6    street of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these\n","<P> 7    are explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of\n","<P> 8    whether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar\n","<P> 9    shells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.\n","<P>10            This was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the\n","<P>11    Serbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the\n","<P>12    threats that were made, and so on and so forth.\n","<P>13       Q.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there\n","<P>14    you did so only to give political support to the leadership of\n","<P>15    Republika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and\n","<P>16    bombing.\n","<P>17       A.   Yes.\n","<P>18       Q.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  \"In January or February\n","<P>19    1992\" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, \"Arkan's\n","<P>20    and Seselj's units arrived in Doboj.\"\n","<P>21            Is this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?\n","<P>22       A.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,\n","<P>23    there were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.\n","<P>24            Secondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to\n","<P>25    Doboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan's Tigers never\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    operated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to\n","<P> 3    this question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on\n","<P> 4    transcript page 27738, quite explicitly, \"Mirko Blagojevic,\" that is to\n","<P> 5    say, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he\n","<P> 6    says:  \"Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,\n","<P> 7    and he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with\n","<P> 8    Seselj.\"\n","<P> 9            I am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical\n","<P>10    Party or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that\n","<P>11    Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So\n","<P>12    please deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the\n","<P>13    transcript.  Is it correct or not?\n","<P>14       A.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is\n","<P>15    organised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A\n","<P>16    conflict occurs when two armed formations clash.\n","<P>17            Mirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in\n","<P>18    Bijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim\n","<P>19    formations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any\n","<P>20    conflicts.  And I guarantee with my own life that he took part in no\n","<P>21    looting, no persecutions, no maltreatment of the civilian population and\n","<P>22    so on and so forth.  I'm absolutely certain of that.\n","<P>23       Q.   Thank you.\n","<P>24       A.   I can fully identify with everything that Mirko Blagojevic did.\n","<P>25    It is to that degree that I'm certain that he never did anything against\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the law.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  \"Seselj's\n","<P> 3    men tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm.\"\n","<P> 4       A.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?\n","<P> 5       Q.   My understanding is it's somewhere near Zvornik.\n","<P> 6       A.   That's quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","<P> 7    Party took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there\n","<P> 8    in brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on\n","<P> 9    for a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the\n","<P>10    Muslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to\n","<P>11    an end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","<P>12    withdrew.\n","<P>13            I preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on\n","<P>14    guarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing\n","<P>15    happened, I would have had to know about it.\n","<P>16       Q.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you\n","<P>17    personally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following\n","<P>18    circumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  \"Seselj,\n","<P>19    on Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired\n","<P>20    it at Muslims in Sarajevo.\"  This was shown on television, and he said\n","<P>21    that you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.\n","<P>22       A.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at\n","<P>23    Grbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called\n","<P>24    international observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go\n","<P>25    around the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Serb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was\n","<P> 2    an apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I\n","<P> 3    used a Browning machine-gun from there.  It's a heavy machine-gun.  I\n","<P> 4    couldn't carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry\n","<P> 5    it around.\n","<P> 6       Q.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.\n","<P> 7       A.   You cannot carry it.  It's too long.  It was installed in that\n","<P> 8    building, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches\n","<P> 9    below the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of\n","<P>10    the volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was\n","<P>11    firing from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and\n","<P>12    the top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is\n","<P>13    something I don't know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who\n","<P>14    could have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this\n","<P>15    small participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.\n","<P>16            A Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that\n","<P>17    case, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been\n","<P>18    forced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of\n","<P>19    those who in violation of international law of war brought him out there\n","<P>20    to dig trenches, not those who --\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>23       Q.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,\n","<P>24    that at the beginning of April Seselj's men arrived in the area of\n","<P>25    Bratunac and Zvornik.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic's part.  He knows\n","<P> 2    full well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing\n","<P> 3    who he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and\n","<P> 4    making this sweeping statement Seselj's men arrived in Bratunac and\n","<P> 5    Zvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it's as if they were in Bratunac\n","<P> 6    too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so\n","<P> 7    Deronjic invented that.\n","<P> 8            In Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the\n","<P> 9    Bratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was\n","<P>10    commander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he\n","<P>11    was not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,\n","<P>12    then a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.  I think the interpreter is having\n","<P>14    some difficulty.\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will.\n","<P>16            You could have noticed, Mr. Robinson, that I have been trying as\n","<P>17    of late to speak slowly, but sometimes, every now and then, I may forget\n","<P>18    what you cautioned me about.\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, I had noticed, and the -- we are\n","<P>20    appreciative of the effort you are making.  You have answered the\n","<P>21    question.\n","<P>22            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the meantime --\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think you have answered that question.\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>25       Q.   So they were not in Bratunac at all?\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in\n","<P> 2    Bratunac.\n","<P> 3       Q.   All right.  So you are saying that he's not telling the truth.\n","<P> 4            The same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not\n","<P> 5    agree that Seselj was a true opposition.\n","<P> 6       A.   The Hague OTP and Judge Schomburg on several occasions caught\n","<P> 7    Deronjic lying.  And even in Deronjic's judgement you can find about seven\n","<P> 8    different points as ascertained by Judge Schomburg, namely that Deronjic\n","<P> 9    was lying.\n","<P>10            Secondly, in the case of people who are inclined to a pro-Western\n","<P>11    policy or are mercenaries of Western intelligence agencies, or in order to\n","<P>12    save their own skin they go into plea bargaining with the OTP and\n","<P>13    therefore appear as witnesses in the trials of other people, it can often\n","<P>14    be heard that those who are really opposition but are not prepared to\n","<P>15    serve the West --\n","<P>16            MR. NICE:  I'm not sure this is responsive to any question --\n","<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Are you interrupting me?\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet, Mr. Seselj, and he's\n","<P>19    entitled to make an objection if he wishes.\n","<P>20            MR. NICE:  He was simply asked if the man was telling the truth.\n","<P>21    We have his answer and he's now gone on to a long comment basically.\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, you have moved into the area of comment.\n","<P>23            It's now time for the break.\n","<P>24            Mr. Nice, I should say the question that I asked earlier related\n","<P>25    to the Bosnia indictment.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            We will break for 20 minutes.\n","<P> 2                          --- Recess taken at 3.41 p.m.\n","<P> 3                          --- On resuming at 4.08 p.m.\n","<P> 4            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, you told me to check\n","<P> 6    the pages that Mr. Nice mentioned, 35 -- 20352 and 20351, that is.  This\n","<P> 7    was Witness 1070.\n","<P> 8            On page 20351 he says that Seselj's men were in Bratunac and that\n","<P> 9    there was no difference between them and Seselj's men, the White Eagles,\n","<P>10    that is.\n","<P>11            And on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April\n","<P>12    Seselj's and Arkan's men were in Bratunac together when some people were\n","<P>13    deported.  And Mr. Seselj answered questions about this.  In the meantime,\n","<P>14    the liaison officer had the transcript, and I have received a note saying\n","<P>15    that both references are correct, both as regards page 20351 and 20352,\n","<P>16    and these refer to Witness 1070.  There was no error.\n","<P>17            JUDGE ROBINSON:  All right, Mr. Milosevic.  We'll do our own\n","<P>18    check.  Thank you for checking anyhow.\n","<P>19            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>20       Q.   Mr. Seselj, this is the testimony of Miroslav Deronjic, who said\n","<P>21    that you were not truly an opposition politician or, rather, that you\n","<P>22    cooperated with the government and that therefore this idea of a joint\n","<P>23    criminal enterprise is thereby confirmed.  Were you in the opposition or\n","<P>24    not?\n","<P>25            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it\n","<P> 2    on.\n","<P> 3            Both the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time\n","<P> 4    were distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as\n","<P> 5    it's possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by\n","<P> 6    Deronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the\n","<P> 7    opposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint\n","<P> 8    often expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various\n","<P> 9    government and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person\n","<P>10    of the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or\n","<P>11    Miles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery\n","<P>12    and so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while\n","<P>13    criticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition\n","<P>14    politicians, and this logic is completely upside down.\n","<P>15            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>16       Q.   Witness Ahmet Zulic says, and that's on page 30000 of the\n","<P>17    transcript, he says that Seselj's men were stationed in the partisan\n","<P>18    cemetery in Pobrezje, that doesn't matter so much but what matters is the\n","<P>19    following, that they had come there to kill the Muslims.\n","<P>20       A.   Where is this place?  Pobrezje?  Where is it?\n","<P>21       Q.   I have a note here in Pobrezje.  I can't be more specific than\n","<P>22    that.\n","<P>23            But let me put a question to you:  Did your volunteers go anywhere\n","<P>24    to kill all Muslims?\n","<P>25       A.   No.  Nowhere did the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party go to\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    kill Muslims or Croats or any kind of civilians.  Wherever they went, they\n","<P> 2    were part of the JNA, and they went there to fight against the\n","<P> 3    paramilitary units that wanted to break up Yugoslavia.\n","<P> 4            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, it's important to know the\n","<P> 5    location.  I'm not sure whether Mr. Nice or Mr. Kay can help.  Your note\n","<P> 6    doesn't identify clearly the name of this place?\n","<P> 7            MR. NICE:  I tried to make an electronic search but for various\n","<P> 8    reasons it doesn't work at the moment or doesn't work for this witness on\n","<P> 9    this particular part of his evidence.  I'll try again.\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  You said Pobrezje.\n","<P>12            Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>14       Q.   The same witness, Ahmet Zulic, on page 30047, says in Sanski Most\n","<P>15    there was no fighting, but the civilians fled because Seselj's men were\n","<P>16    there.\n","<P>17            Your men caused fear among civilians, although there was no\n","<P>18    fighting there, as he says, in Sanski Most.\n","<P>19       A.   That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,\n","<P>20    throughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did\n","<P>21    not fight in any location.\n","<P>22            This reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a\n","<P>23    certain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying\n","<P>24    that sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.\n","<P>25    Somebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    arriving, and he spread panic.\n","<P> 2            THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that the Serbian word for\n","<P> 3    sugar resembles Mr. Seselj's name.\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere\n","<P> 5    in that area.\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 7       Q.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  \"From the\n","<P> 8    1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan\n","<P> 9    Milosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint\n","<P>10    criminal,\" and so on,\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise\n","<P>11    aided and abetted,\" and so on and so forth, all these phrases, \"the\n","<P>12    planning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories\n","<P>13    of Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,\n","<P>14    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.\"\n","<P>15            Tell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in\n","<P>16    this joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged\n","<P>17    crimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made\n","<P>18    here?\n","<P>19       A.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from\n","<P>20    Serbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia\n","<P>21    and Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted\n","<P>22    to proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the\n","<P>23    will of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the\n","<P>24    West who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or\n","<P>25    execution or extermination.  There was no plan.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            When the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in\n","<P> 2    many places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only\n","<P> 3    where the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats\n","<P> 4    were in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,\n","<P> 5    not a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the\n","<P> 6    majority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They\n","<P> 7    had already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.\n","<P> 8       Q.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we\n","<P> 9    have already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the\n","<P>10    other places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,\n","<P>11    Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in\n","<P>12    any kind of military activities?\n","<P>13       A.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in\n","<P>14    January, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but\n","<P>15    the UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,\n","<P>16    although they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was\n","<P>17    established, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be\n","\n","<P>18    disarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.\n","<P>19            The Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian\n","<P>20    villages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there\n","<P>21    were two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active\n","<P>22    in the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces\n","<P>23    in the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the\n","<P>24    only activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica\n","<P>25    area.  It was in the beginning of 1993.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            As for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,\n","<P> 2    I don't know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up\n","<P> 3    only in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all\n","<P> 4    over Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army\n","<P> 5    of the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska\n","<P> 6    Krajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his\n","<P> 7    volunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars\n","<P> 8    there, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.\n","<P> 9       Q.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed\n","<P>10    and what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy\n","<P>11    that we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in\n","<P>12    whole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and\n","<P>13    Herzegovina?\n","<P>14       A.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and\n","<P>15    there was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen\n","<P>16    happened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on\n","<P>17    their own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit\n","<P>18    murders or anything of the kind.\n","<P>19       Q.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war\n","<P>20    in Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the\n","<P>21    other participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by\n","<P>22    Mr. Nice.\n","<P>23            Look at paragraph 33.  We've just been discussing paragraph 32.  I\n","<P>24    won't read the beginning of paragraph 33 because it's the same:  \"From on\n","<P>25    or about the 1st of March, 1992,\" and so on and so forth, and then it\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    says:  \"On the territory of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa,\n","<P> 2    Bosanski Novi, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Sarajevo (Ilijas), Kljuc,\n","<P> 3    Kalinovik, Kotor Varos, Nevesinje, Sarajevo, Novi Grad, Sarajevo, Novo\n","<P> 4    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Rudo, Sanski Most, Srebrenica\n","<P> 5    again, Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\"  Please --\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  You are finished reading that list.  Let me\n","<P> 7    remind you, Mr. Milosevic, that the Rule 98 bis decision found that there\n","<P> 8    was not enough evidence to support the allegation in paragraph 32 in\n","<P> 9    relation to some of the villages or municipalities mentioned.  In fact, as\n","<P>10    far as paragraph 32 is concerned, you need only concern yourself with\n","<P>11    Brcko, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Bijeljina, Kotor Varos, Kljuc,\n","<P>12    Bosanski Novi.  And I am checking to see whether the decision affected\n","<P>13    paragraph 33.\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, could you please let\n","<P>15    me know what evidence, as you say there was no evidence for these places,\n","<P>16    but what was the evidence that Mr. Nice presented here about the other\n","<P>17    places linking me --\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.  Mr. Milosevic, the Rule 98 bis\n","<P>19    decision was published and was available to you.  But I bring that to your\n","<P>20    attention so we don't waste time.  And I'll ask the legal officer to give\n","<P>21    me the information in relation to paragraph 33.\n","<P>22            Go ahead, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>23            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>24       Q.   As I was saying, Mr. Seselj, I read out a list here.  It's a long\n","<P>25    paragraph with all the names of the towns where I, together with others,\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    am charged with working for the extermination of Muslims and Croats.  You\n","<P> 2    know the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that\n","<P> 3    referred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded\n","<P> 4    in any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?\n","<P> 5       A.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted\n","<P> 6    to, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A\n","<P> 7    civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally\n","<P> 8    wanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a\n","<P> 9    constituent people.\n","<P>10            And the question arises from there where are the Serbs from\n","<P>11    Mostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from\n","<P>12    Travnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from\n","<P>13    many other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats\n","<P>14    during that civil war?\n","<P>15            After the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the\n","<P>16    population, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did\n","<P>17    take place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,\n","<P>18    in figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I\n","<P>19    can put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes\n","<P>20    crimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,\n","<P>21    sometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,\n","<P>22    criminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and\n","<P>23    revenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes\n","<P>24    did not exist.  That did not happen.\n","<P>25       Q.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    joint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I'd like\n","<P> 2    to draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of\n","<P> 3    December, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33\n","<P> 4    and indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns\n","<P> 5    are repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns\n","<P> 6    too.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.\n","<P> 7            So what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during\n","<P> 8    that period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of\n","<P> 9    December 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring\n","<P>10    Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n","<P>11       A.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia\n","<P>12    or, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It\n","<P>14    did not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help\n","<P>15    materially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs\n","<P>16    living over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different\n","<P>17    political relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership\n","<P>18    of Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in\n","<P>19    which those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep\n","<P>20    conflicts, and they didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues.\n","<P>21            So throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the\n","<P>22    indictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,\n","<P>23    the leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered\n","<P>24    in looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far\n","<P>25    accepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    attacked ourselves for our part.\n","<P> 2            So I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy\n","<P> 3    dating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact\n","<P> 4    that that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all\n","<P> 5    costs.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no\n","<P> 6    alternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at\n","<P> 7    the price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept\n","<P> 8    because they were not able to take such great concessions.\n","<P> 9       Q.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities\n","<P>10    of that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these\n","<P>11    towns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I\n","<P>12    personally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,\n","<P>13    et cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason\n","<P>14    explanation?\n","<P>15       A.   Yes, I do, and that's explanation is the following and the fact\n","<P>16    that through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,\n","<P>17    and --\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not\n","<P>19    an explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.\n","<P>20            So please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,\n","<P>23    Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac\n","<P>24    again, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in\n","<P>25    Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with\n","<P> 2    regard to that point of the indictment?\n","<P> 3       A.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised\n","<P> 4    crime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don't know whether in all the\n","<P> 5    places enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took\n","<P> 6    place in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each\n","<P> 7    individual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the\n","<P> 8    motives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are\n","<P> 9    still living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can\n","<P>10    be established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side\n","<P>11    and the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to\n","<P>12    investigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to\n","<P>13    strike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the\n","<P>14    number of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.\n","<P>15       Q.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you've said when you said\n","<P>16    that some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let's look at\n","<P>17    that for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of\n","<P>18    Yugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or\n","<P>19    formations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes\n","<P>20    that you know of?  Are there any links?\n","<P>21       A.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of\n","<P>22    power and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as\n","<P>23    well, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,\n","<P>24    the Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the\n","<P>25    Academy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    everybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out\n","<P> 2    against them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for\n","<P> 3    freedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were\n","<P> 4    being perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes\n","<P> 5    should be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind\n","<P> 6    via the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political\n","<P> 7    parties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which\n","<P> 8    strove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors\n","<P> 9    spoke out against crimes.\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","<P>11            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>12       Q.   Now, we -- let's look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful\n","<P>13    confinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,\n","<P>14    Bosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the\n","<P>15    territories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,\n","<P>16    Samac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,\n","<P>17    Kotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,\n","<P>18    Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\n","<P>19            Tell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these\n","<P>20    people in these towns did we take part in?\n","<P>21       A.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have\n","<P>22    had anything to do with any such thing.\n","<P>23            First of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What\n","<P>24    the confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of\n","<P>25    civilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    unlawful, and there were such cases.\n","<P> 2            Now, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of\n","<P> 3    all, there were individual instances in some of these places through the\n","<P> 4    self-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance\n","<P> 5    of Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.\n","<P> 6    And then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of\n","<P> 7    their own because they couldn't influence him.  He appeared as a factor,\n","<P> 8    and there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his\n","<P> 9    motives were of a criminal nature.\n","<P>10            There were other such cases in some of these places whereby\n","<P>11    somebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in\n","<P>12    order to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive\n","<P>13    money and then release them once they received money for that.  There were\n","<P>14    also instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,\n","<P>15    somebody's family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or\n","<P>16    Croats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often\n","<P>17    were not able to prevent revenge of that kind.\n","<P>18       Q.   Which authorities?\n","<P>19       A.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.\n","<P>20       Q.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian\n","<P>21    authorities intervene?\n","<P>22       A.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn't influence or involve\n","<P>23    themselves in any such matters.\n","<P>24            So as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one\n","<P>25    should take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    those cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and\n","<P> 2    what the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.\n","<P> 3            Now, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places\n","<P> 4    where possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of\n","<P> 5    context and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse\n","<P> 6    top-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian\n","<P> 7    Yugoslavia as well.\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has\n","<P> 9    become a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you\n","<P>10    say that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing\n","<P>11    like the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged\n","<P>12    by the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.\n","<P>13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn't understand me correctly,\n","<P>14    Mr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,\n","<P>15    but there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top\n","<P>16    echelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely\n","<P>17    impossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like\n","<P>18    that, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is\n","<P>19    impossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such\n","<P>20    thing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did\n","<P>21    commit crimes.  And it wasn't only individuals who committed crimes.\n","<P>22    There was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.\n","<P>23    And I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my\n","<P>24    information, but I can't be well-versed in everything, but I can in\n","<P>25    basics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    wasn't the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit\n","<P> 2    crimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn't the policy of the\n","<P> 3    leadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.\n","<P> 4            Now, --\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn't the policy of this accused in\n","<P> 6    concert with other --\n","<P> 7            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of\n","<P> 8    Mr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,\n","<P> 9    continuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such\n","<P>10    crimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the\n","<P>11    most serious form of war crimes.\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>14       Q.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There's an enormous\n","<P>15    list of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,\n","<P>16    and the subject here is deportation.\n","<P>17            Now, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let's clarify that.  Albeit in\n","<P>18    Serbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,\n","<P>19    Muslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\n","<P>20    70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle\n","<P>21    of non-discrimination like anybody else.\n","<P>22            Now, I can't clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is\n","<P>23    being accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it\n","<P>24    stated here -- it says:  \"Milosevic, acting alone or together with other\n","<P>25    members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or\n","<P> 2    execution of the unlawful forcible transfer...\"\n","<P> 3            Now, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic\n","<P> 4    of Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or\n","<P> 5    unlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful\n","<P> 6    movement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one\n","<P> 7    individual?\n","<P> 8       A.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with\n","<P> 9    anything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these\n","<P>10    phenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what\n","<P>11    did happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group\n","<P>12    to leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that\n","<P>13    desire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were\n","<P>14    instances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,\n","<P>15    that people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,\n","<P>16    something afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind\n","<P>17    what had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to\n","<P>18    move out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or\n","<P>19    perhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they\n","<P>20    were the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and\n","<P>21    in some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established\n","<P>22    in some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete\n","<P>23    example, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from\n","<P>24    Prijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a\n","<P>25    convoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I'm stopping you because you have\n","<P> 2    answered the question.  You are becoming a little too expansive.\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think that this would be very\n","<P> 4    important.\n","<P> 5            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 6       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what example do you know of personally?\n","<P> 7       A.   I'm talking about one example when Muslims were transported\n","<P> 8    because they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And\n","<P> 9    then the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose\n","<P>10    name is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is\n","<P>11    called Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large\n","<P>12    group of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the\n","<P>13    authorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part\n","<P>14    of Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army\n","<P>15    of Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.\n","<P>16            Then he tried to explain this in a completely different way:\n","<P>17    Somebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he's\n","<P>18    trying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.\n","<P>19            Such people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,\n","<P>20    entered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and\n","<P>21    then they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed\n","<P>22    although they are invariably false because --\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm stopping you.  Mr. Seselj, no doubt you're a\n","<P>24    man of many virtues.  Is omniscience one of them?  How do you happen to\n","<P>25    know all these things?  I have to ask myself that question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson --\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Where is your knowledge coming from?\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, all my life I have\n","<P> 4    been learning, learning, learning, and constantly learning.  Even now in\n","<P> 5    prison I read eight to ten hours a day, although the conditions under\n","<P> 6    which I live are very poor because they want to prevent me from preparing\n","<P> 7    my defence case properly.  But I'm a constant learner, and I wish others\n","<P> 8    were too.\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  It would help my appreciation of your evidence if\n","<P>10    only occasionally we were told of the basis for the information that you\n","<P>11    have about specific matters.\n","<P>12            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of\n","<P>15    Serbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and\n","<P>16    that as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon\n","<P>17    what do you base this statement?\n","<P>18       A.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I\n","<P>19    base my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent\n","<P>20    statements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.\n","<P>21            Secondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.\n","<P>22    They never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never\n","<P>23    discriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the\n","<P>24    authorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in\n","<P>25    Bosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    and treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.\n","<P> 2            So there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic\n","<P> 3    whatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution\n","<P> 4    of Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in\n","<P> 5    Serbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal\n","<P> 6    of money.  Perhaps not all of them were happy with what they got, but this\n","<P> 7    involved major expenditure on the part of the state.\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  But did the authorities of Serbia allow\n","<P> 9    discrimination over any Muslim Croat or the member of any other ethnic\n","<P>10    group in Serbia during the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia?\n","<P>11       A.   No.  Even if there were any incidents on ethnic grounds, the\n","<P>12    authorities acted in accordance with the law and brought such matters to\n","<P>13    trial.  They simply did not allow things like that to happen.\n","<P>14       Q.   Please look at paragraph 42 now.  Again it says here:  \"Slobodan\n","<P>15    Milosevic,\" and so on and so forth, on or about the 1st of March, 1992,\n","<P>16    until 391st of December, 1995, acting alone or in concert with members of\n","<P>17    the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or\n","<P>18    otherwise aided and abetted the planning preparation or execution of\n","<P>19    wanton destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the\n","<P>20    Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations and then\" --\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, too fast.  Too fast.\n","<P>22            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>23       Q.   So I, Mr. Seselj, according to this paragraph 42, aided and\n","<P>24    abetted the planning, preparation or execution, I executed this.  It\n","<P>25    wasn't that I only aided and abetted others, but I committed wanton\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the Bosnian\n","<P> 2    Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations, and again all these\n","<P> 3    municipalities are listed here where I committed wanton looting of\n","<P> 4    property belonging to Muslims and Croats.\n","<P> 5            Please tell us not only what you know about this but also on the\n","<P> 6    basis of what you know what you know.\n","<P> 7       A.   This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in\n","<P> 8    any way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of\n","<P> 9    private and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three\n","<P>10    sides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything\n","<P>11    under control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.\n","<P>12            What happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims\n","<P>13    would loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have\n","<P>14    their own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar\n","<P>15    way in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no\n","<P>16    official authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No\n","<P>17    one personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,\n","<P>18    et cetera.\n","<P>19            There were paramilitary formations that had looting as their\n","<P>20    primary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also\n","<P>21    from Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People\n","<P>22    travelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize\n","<P>23    their car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were\n","<P>24    such cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial\n","<P>25    Chamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    looting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions\n","<P> 2    that were rather chaotic.\n","<P> 3            There was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.\n","<P> 4    Not only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika\n","<P> 5    Srpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.\n","<P> 6       Q.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in\n","<P> 7    a military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto\n","<P> 8    civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and\n","<P> 9    wounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.\n","<P>10            You were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please\n","<P>11    explain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,\n","<P>12    tell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of\n","<P>13    Yugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.\n","<P>14       A.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a\n","<P>15    dissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict\n","<P>16    in Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of\n","<P>17    the duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case\n","<P>18    elsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on\n","<P>19    both sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less\n","<P>20    casualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what\n","<P>21    Judge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I\n","<P>22    read.\n","<P>23            I was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the\n","<P>24    killing of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted\n","<P>25    intentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Muslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present\n","<P> 2    this in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,\n","<P> 3    Vasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not\n","<P> 4    take part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official\n","<P> 5    factors from Serbia, that is.\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.  On the transcript it's a double\n","<P> 7    negative.\n","<P> 8            Yes, Mr. --\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] There is a double negative in the\n","<P>10    Serbian language and it does not change the meaning of the statement.  In\n","<P>11    English it might mean something different.  I'm sorry I don't know English\n","<P>12    and I cannot really adjust to this.\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>14       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or\n","<P>15    deny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took\n","<P>16    part in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you\n","<P>17    confirm that?\n","<P>18       A.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.\n","<P>19       Q.   All right.  Thank you.\n","<P>20       A.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The\n","<P>21    Muslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the\n","<P>22    liberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.\n","<P>23       Q.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his\n","<P>24    witness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,\n","<P>25    including women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only\n","<P> 2    logical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee\n","<P> 3    from war.  They're fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.\n","<P> 4            Very often in this war and in any other war civilians would get\n","<P> 5    killed by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from\n","<P> 6    the conflict.\n","<P> 7       Q.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the\n","<P> 8    Serbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it's supposed\n","<P> 9    to seem?\n","<P>10       A.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray\n","<P>11    this, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their\n","<P>12    victims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We\n","<P>13    are faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is\n","<P>14    based and anti-Serb grounds.\n","<P>15       Q.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings\n","<P>16    happened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all\n","<P>17    of that can be found here in this indictment that I've been quoting to\n","<P>18    you, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.\n","<P>19            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to\n","<P>20    give.  Ask another question.\n","<P>21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a\n","<P>22    question to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that\n","<P>23    he can give an answer.  He's a politician, an intellectual, a university\n","<P>24    professor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,\n","<P>25    and he is in a position to give an answer to this question.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  And I've already ruled that he is not to answer\n","<P> 2    it.  So proceed.\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 5       Q.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the\n","<P> 6    JNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know\n","<P> 7    about that?  This is on transcript page 20408.\n","<P> 8       A.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The\n","<P> 9    two sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the\n","<P>10    bridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric\n","<P>11    power plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to\n","<P>12    destroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old\n","<P>13    hydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the\n","<P>14    paramilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The\n","<P>15    conflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can't say exactly, I\n","<P>16    wasn't there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And\n","<P>17    then also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.\n","<P>18       Q.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units\n","<P>19    committed crimes in Zvornik.\n","<P>20       A.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there\n","<P>21    that can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but\n","<P>22    who it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are\n","<P>23    ascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to\n","<P>24    Karadzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.\n","<P>25            In Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    people for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 4       Q.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing\n","<P> 5    them, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They\n","<P> 6    are mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided\n","<P> 7    by Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,\n","<P> 8    Drinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you\n","<P> 9    heard anything about this and what do you know about it?\n","<P>10       A.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my\n","<P>11    knowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but\n","<P>12    once the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very\n","<P>13    simply, who the victims were and who the executors were.\n","<P>14       Q.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the\n","<P>15    cultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many\n","<P>16    persons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force\n","<P>17    there is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I'll just go\n","<P>18    on.\n","<P>19       A.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were\n","<P>20    committed.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn't the JNA that\n","<P>21    took part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take\n","<P>22    part in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully\n","<P>23    investigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims\n","<P>24    are still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether\n","<P>25    there was enough will to investigate this matter, and I've already\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    referred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect\n","<P> 2    a great deal from that.\n","<P> 3       Q.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?\n","<P> 4       A.   No, I don't know anything about it.  I wasn't there.\n","<P> 5            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj and Mr. Milosevic, you are not\n","<P> 6    observing the pause between question and answer, and you are thereby\n","<P> 7    creating difficulties for the interpreter.\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, this is the first time\n","<P> 9    you have warned us about this today.  As you see, Mr. Seselj and I are\n","<P>10    bearing this in mind.\n","<P>11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We're practising.\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment\n","<P>14    in this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your\n","<P>15    units.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan's men.  Do\n","<P>16    you have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your\n","<P>17    units were there?  You've already explained you didn't have any units of\n","<P>18    yours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers\n","<P>19    were there?\n","<P>20       A.   I'm not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik\n","<P>21    area.  I know that Arkan's Tigers were active there but to what extent and\n","<P>22    in what locations I couldn't say because I wasn't there.\n","<P>23            All the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I\n","<P>24    do not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and\n","<P>25    misfortunes he talked about, but evidently he's very confused when\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    identifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He's mixing up Seselj's\n","<P> 2    men, the White Eagles, Arkan's men, and this shows that he's very confused\n","<P> 3    and unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers\n","<P> 4    of the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to\n","<P> 5    everything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very\n","<P> 6    often it's beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn't be easy to\n","<P> 7    establish who actually perpetrated this.\n","<P> 8       Q.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a\n","<P> 9    certain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the\n","<P>10    transcript.  Do you know anything about this?\n","<P>11       A.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","<P>12    committed any crimes in that place.\n","<P>13       Q.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb\n","<P>14    Radical Party?\n","<P>15       A.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party\n","<P>16    sent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,\n","<P>17    and as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me\n","<P>18    had any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I'm sure of it.\n","<P>19       Q.   Would other volunteers have reported this?\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and\n","<P>21    they would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,\n","<P>22    because this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about\n","<P>24    the conducts of the volunteers?\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn't say the reports were\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    regular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out\n","<P> 2    how the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All\n","<P> 3    the problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of\n","<P> 4    indiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers\n","<P> 5    to be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline\n","<P> 6    of the other men.\n","<P> 7            I was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the\n","<P> 8    conclusion that none occurred.\n","<P> 9            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral\n","<P>11    conversations.\n","<P>12            I'm convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written\n","<P>13    reports would have been sent to me.  I'm sure that the competent command\n","<P>14    would have told me had something like this happened.\n","<P>15            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>16            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>17       Q.   Mr. Seselj, if you can't recall it doesn't matter, but is it true\n","<P>18    that in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,\n","<P>19    1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of\n","<P>20    Seselj's men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?\n","<P>21       A.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj's men, then\n","<P>22    should be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell\n","<P>23    you whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group\n","<P>24    of Seselj's men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he's\n","<P>25    the leader if they don't know his name?  What does the term \"leader\" mean?\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Was he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times\n","<P> 2    that volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in\n","<P> 3    units larger than a company.\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I\n","<P> 6    have a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I\n","<P> 7    wanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the\n","<P> 8    indictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no\n","<P> 9    such instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","<P>10    Party.\n","<P>11            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>12            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>13       Q.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such\n","<P>14    instances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various\n","<P>15    allegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of\n","<P>16    time.\n","<P>17            Please tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about\n","<P>18    the events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men\n","<P>19    participated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\n","<P>20       A.   First of all --\n","<P>21            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is that reference?\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I quoted about half an hour ago, but\n","<P>23    it wasn't sufficiently clear.  I will try to find it again.  I'm simply\n","<P>24    trying to establish whether the witness knows anything about\n","<P>25    Bosanski Samac.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have some knowledge but --\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  The answer -- the question I have is --  what do\n","<P> 3    you mean by \"because it says,\" it says, \"that your men participated in\n","<P> 4    taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\"  What is \"it\"?\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj something about\n","<P> 6    Samac before, but right now I can't find it.\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  I take it it's not another reference to the\n","<P> 8    indictment against Mr. Seselj.\n","<P> 9            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I don't think it is.\n","<P>10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have Bosanski Samac mentioned in\n","<P>11    several places on your indictment, if I can be of assistance, and I can\n","<P>12    tell you what I know about the events in Bosanski Samac.\n","<P>13            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>14       Q.   Well, that's the only reason I asked you whether you knew\n","<P>15    anything.\n","<P>16       A.   In paragraph 42 Bosanski Samac is ascribed to you.\n","<P>17       Q.   Well, all the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are\n","<P>18    ascribed to me.  There aren't any which are not ascribed to me.  But what\n","<P>19    do you know about the events there?\n","<P>20            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I don't understand this question.  You\n","<P>21    can't just ask a question, take a municipality and say, \"What do you know\n","<P>22    about events there?\"  There's got to be some point to the question.\n","<P>23            Now, what is this dealing with?\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>25       Q.   Very well.  I won't ask you anything about that, then, because I\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    can't find the reference now.\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, Mr. Milosevic.  If you find the\n","<P> 3    reference, you can come back to it, but bear in mind that you undertook to\n","<P> 4    complete the evidence in chief today.\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I'm doing my best, Mr. Robinson, but\n","<P> 6    there are many, many witnesses who mentioned Mr. Seselj, and I want to see\n","<P> 7    whether there's any truth in anything they said.\n","<P> 8            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, you may -- Mr. Milosevic, you may have\n","<P> 9    other witnesses who may be in a better position to contradict the\n","<P>10    assertions in the Prosecution case than Mr. Seselj himself.  Don't assume\n","<P>11    that because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he's the\n","<P>12    best person to contradict it.\n","<P>13            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>15       Q.   On page 23520 of the transcript.  I'll skip over the witness's\n","<P>16    name because I can't recall at present whether or not he was protected,\n","<P>17    Mr. Robinson.  I don't think he was, because I don't have any note to that\n","<P>18    effect, but he says:  \"In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the\n","<P>19    White Wolves, and the JNA participated.\"\n","<P>20            Do you know anything about this?\n","<P>21       A.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,\n","<P>22    there was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from\n","<P>23    Eastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the\n","<P>24    indictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.\n","<P>25    His name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    helicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was\n","<P> 2    accompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","<P> 3    Party, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for\n","<P> 4    sure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also\n","<P> 5    Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as\n","<P> 6    the Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was\n","<P> 7    charged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in\n","<P> 8    Banja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical\n","<P> 9    Party.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and\n","<P>10    the party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.\n","<P>11       Q.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don't know that Kragujevac\n","<P>12    is not in Bosnia.\n","<P>13       A.   That's correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I'm getting ready\n","<P>14    to obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was\n","<P>15    expelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan\n","<P>16    Savic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the\n","<P>17    Serb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave\n","<P>18    my legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial\n","<P>19    and all the accompanying materials.\n","<P>20            As for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to\n","<P>21    me certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man\n","<P>22    Radovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his\n","<P>23    participation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.\n","<P>24            Those are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members\n","<P>25    of the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    had previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even\n","<P> 2    called him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was\n","<P> 3    Srecko Radovanovic.\n","<P> 4            There was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was\n","<P> 5    certainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was\n","<P> 6    certainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been\n","<P> 7    he would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that\n","<P> 8    unit was called the Grey Wolves.\n","<P> 9            JUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I've understood\n","<P>10    from that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions\n","<P>11    in Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you've said?\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,\n","<P>13    yes.\n","<P>14            JUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called\n","<P>15    the Grey Wolves active there?\n","<P>16            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it's very problematic to say\n","<P>17    paramilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means\n","<P>18    outside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial\n","<P>19    Defence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I'm not\n","<P>20    sure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,\n","<P>21    I think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good\n","<P>22    fighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what\n","<P>23    happened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called\n","<P>24    Crkvina or something like that.  I can't recall it all off the top of my\n","<P>25    head, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Banja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven't dealt with.  Did\n","<P> 3    they participate?\n","<P> 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What\n","<P> 5    Red Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?\n","<P> 6            JUDGE BONOMY:  That's a perfectly legitimate answer for you to\n","<P> 7    give, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the\n","<P> 8    Red Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the\n","<P> 9    quotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,\n","<P>10    which on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they've got\n","<P>11    nothing to do with the question.  So all I'm doing now is trying to find\n","<P>12    out what the real answer to that question is.\n","<P>13            JUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the\n","<P>15    Red Berets.\n","<P>16                          --- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.\n","<P>17                          --- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.\n","<P>18            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the\n","<P>19    technical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary\n","<P>20    resulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected\n","<P>21    witness.\n","<P>22            Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>23            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>25       Q.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Wolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also\n","<P> 2    mentioned.  Now, the witness, I don't know whether he was protected or\n","<P> 3    not, I don't want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the\n","<P> 4    transcript says that he saw 20 locals, and it's about Samac, wearing\n","<P> 5    uniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed\n","<P> 6    they were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned\n","<P> 7    to Samac.  Do you know anything about that?\n","<P> 8       A.   Well, I don't have any information to that effect, and that is\n","<P> 9    quite impossible.  I'd like to point out once again that in different\n","<P>10    places they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had\n","<P>11    found some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have\n","<P>12    been various units, especially as we're talking about locals in this\n","<P>13    particular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What\n","<P>14    does it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some\n","<P>15    warehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they\n","<P>16    were some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the\n","<P>17    Red Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of\n","<P>18    the State Security in 1996.\n","<P>19            So quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term\n","<P>20    applies to different concepts.\n","<P>21       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I\n","<P>22    think that is in the indictment against you but you'll put me right if I'm\n","<P>23    wrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,\n","<P>24    that is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,\n","<P>25    wherein amongst others you said:  \"Dear brother Chetniks, especially you\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    across the Drina, you're the bravest, and we're going to clear up Bosnia\n","<P> 2    from the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong.\"  Is\n","<P> 3    it true that you said that?\n","<P> 4       A.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and\n","<P> 5    partially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,\n","<P> 6    because -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don't always know\n","<P> 7    the Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an\n","<P> 8    artificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the\n","<P> 9    Croats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian\n","<P>10    variation \"pogan\" means \"pagan,\" where as in the Serb language \"pogan\"\n","<P>11    means \"waste\" or \"faeces.\"  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and\n","<P>12    pan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called\n","<P>13    them \"pogani,\" which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the\n","<P>14    Muslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I'm not a stupid\n","<P>15    man.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have\n","<P>16    nothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more\n","<P>17    than I do to all the Christians afterwards, let's make that point clear,\n","<P>18    but I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --\n","<P>19    greatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims\n","<P>20    to be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.\n","<P>21            So here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion\n","<P>22    is being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,\n","<P>23    and I've been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,\n","<P>24    Islamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they\n","<P>25    first appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","<P> 2            JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?\n","<P> 3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.  Well, if you\n","<P> 4    haven't got if it in my books then the Prosecution probably has a copy\n","<P> 5    because most of my speeches were published in my books, in my works so, if\n","<P> 6    a speech does not happen to be there, if --\n","<P> 7            JUDGE BONOMY:  Was this one published in your books?  I apologise.\n","<P> 8    I haven't read them all.\n","<P> 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson [sic], two years ago I\n","<P>10    handed over to The Hague Tribunal 80 of my printed works.\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  Is this speech in any of them?\n","<P>12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Most probably, but it would be up to\n","<P>13    the Prosecution to find it, not me.  I can't look through that whole\n","<P>14    matter myself, because I didn't make the statement only in one place.  I\n","<P>15    made the statement in several places, on several occasions.\n","<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  Well, normally the party presenting the evidence is\n","<P>17    responsible for getting it to court in some -- as official as is possible,\n","<P>18    but you're not aware of a copy of it being available for us as part of the\n","<P>19    papers in connection with your evidence.\n","<P>20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Bonomy, the side that has\n","<P>21    referred to my alleged speech is the Prosecution's side.  So I'm just\n","<P>22    telling you where they made a mistake.  So they can find the original of\n","<P>23    the speech and present it here.  I can't do the work of the Prosecution.\n","<P>24    I can't be expected to do that.  I am testifying to the facts and\n","<P>25    circumstances about which I have knowledge.  I'm not here to help the\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Prosecution out in its work.  And for my part, I have contributed\n","<P> 2    sufficiently by handing over all my books.  They have far greater\n","<P> 3    resources than I do.\n","<P> 4            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Nice, can you help?  Where do I locate the\n","<P> 5    evidence, readily locate the evidence in relation to this?\n","<P> 6            MR. NICE:  I'm not sure you can locate it readily at the moment\n","<P> 7    from our own database.  It may be possible.\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  It appears Mr. Seselj is suggesting that there is\n","<P> 9    evidence of this speech led by the Prosecution in this case.\n","<P>10            MR. NICE:  It may be in this case or it may be in the pre-trial\n","<P>11    brief of his own case.  I'll deal with it as soon as I can.\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  All right.  Thank you.\n","<P>13            MR. NICE:  We can't of course be guided in the way we are going to\n","<P>14    present our questions through his observations.  We'll make our own\n","<P>15    decisions.\n","<P>16            JUDGE BONOMY:  No, no, no.  That's nothing to the point.  I'm just\n","<P>17    trying to clarify where I can read this speech, but if no one's going to\n","<P>18    help me, that's okay.\n","<P>19            MR. NICE:  We certainly will help you when we can.\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>22       Q.   Witness B1643 who testified pursuant to 92 bis, I assume you know\n","<P>23    the written part, mentioned torture and capture of civilians in the SUP\n","<P>24    building of the Territorial Defence in the primary school and secondary\n","<P>25    school in Crkvina, the warehouse there.  Do you know anything about that?\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   Well, I already mentioned something about this.  I said that the\n","<P> 2    Crkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey\n","<P> 3    Wolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was\n","<P> 4    arrested, but I don't have any details about how the trial proceeded and\n","<P> 5    the upshot.  I asked my legal advisors to find the complete dossier of\n","<P> 6    that trial, but I do know for certain that he was arrested and taken to\n","<P> 7    trial in Banja Luka, prosecuted in Banja Luka.\n","<P> 8       Q.   The indictment against you, in the indictment you are accused of\n","<P> 9    an act on the 7th of May, 1992, which allegedly happened there which says\n","<P>10    that two leaders of your group under your command killed 18 males at the\n","<P>11    agricultural farm in Crkvina.  Is that the event you are referring to?\n","<P>12       A.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn't there\n","<P>13    nor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical\n","<P>14    Party.\n","<P>15       Q.   That's all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your\n","<P>16    answer suffices.\n","<P>17            You are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when\n","<P>18    allegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated\n","<P>19    killed 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating\n","<P>21    on the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?\n","<P>22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was\n","<P>23    quoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.\n","<P>24    So it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this\n","<P>25    question of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    concept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he\n","<P> 2    stands accused, because he's testifying here.\n","<P> 3            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily\n","<P> 4    relevant for that purpose.\n","<P> 5            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I'm not going to\n","<P> 6    insist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.\n","<P> 7            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 8       Q.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993\n","<P> 9    some members of your alleged --\n","<P>10            JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have\n","<P>11    continued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not\n","<P>12    see at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial\n","<P>13    here.  I know that he's alleged to be a member of the joint criminal\n","<P>14    enterprise.  I'm well aware of that.  But that doesn't let in any and all\n","<P>15    kind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.\n","<P>16            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see\n","<P>17    here that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,\n","<P>18    then that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren't true\n","<P>19    either, and he has refuted a number of witnesses' statements here that I\n","<P>20    quoted.\n","<P>21            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know\n","<P>22    you know that.\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, witness William Thomas Francis Roy on page 28882 of\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the transcript stated here that the Muslim snipers killed three pregnant\n","<P> 2    women and only then did the Serb snipers respond by opening fire.  Do you\n","<P> 3    know anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked\n","<P> 4    to killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire\n","<P> 6    in Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front\n","<P> 7    line stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part\n","<P> 8    under Muslim control and another part under Serb control.\n","<P> 9            Now, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind\n","<P>10    the following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from\n","<P>11    rifles which wasn't a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because\n","<P>12    sniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with\n","<P>13    optic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the\n","<P>14    Serb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to\n","<P>15    come by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black\n","<P>16    market.  I don't exclude the possibility of individual cases there being\n","<P>17    the need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was\n","<P>18    opened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain\n","<P>19    control of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two\n","<P>20    sides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn't\n","<P>21    change for many years, and one or the other side would take control of\n","<P>22    certain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.\n","<P>23            On the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional\n","<P>24    killing of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims\n","<P>25    killed about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    in Kazani and so on.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the\n","<P> 3    Sarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present\n","<P> 4    on both sides.  Is that true?\n","<P> 5       A.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in\n","<P> 6    Sarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The\n","<P> 7    real snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far\n","<P> 8    more than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more\n","<P> 9    sophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more\n","<P>10    favourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.\n","<P>11            JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I've forgotten the evidence which I\n","<P>12    think there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How\n","<P>13    much personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the\n","<P>14    conflict there.\n","<P>15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to\n","<P>16    the Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that\n","<P>17    is.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.\n","<P>18    At Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and\n","<P>19    I met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh\n","<P>20    shipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my\n","<P>21    colleagues from university and also people whom I'd been to school with,\n","<P>22    Muslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.\n","<P>23            JUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire\n","<P>24    going on?\n","<P>25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    stay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some\n","<P> 2    dangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you\n","<P> 3    had to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but\n","<P> 4    there were no more serious conflicts at that time.\n","<P> 5            JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 7       Q.   Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,\n","<P> 8    referred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on\n","<P> 9    page 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs\n","<P>10    fired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in\n","<P>11    Sarajevo?\n","<P>12       A.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open\n","<P>13    fire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be\n","<P>14    ascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused\n","<P>15    protected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction\n","<P>16    from the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo\n","<P>17    they would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at\n","<P>18    Serb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off\n","<P>19    in the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,\n","<P>20    then they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at\n","<P>21    hospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,\n","<P>22    who were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the\n","<P>23    hospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw\n","<P>24    quickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived\n","<P>25    they didn't come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    fire in retaliation.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited\n","<P> 3    Bijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --\n","<P> 4    page 8258 of Alija Gusalic's -- 18258, and I link this up with your\n","<P> 5    indictment and Alija Gusalic's testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina\n","<P> 6    and members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to\n","<P> 7    takeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?\n","<P> 8       A.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite\n","<P> 9    correct.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just\n","<P>10    nonsense.\n","<P>11       Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there\n","<P>12    were Arkan's men and Seselj's men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything\n","<P>13    about that?\n","<P>14       A.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb\n","<P>15    Radical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I'm absolutely certain\n","<P>16    of that.\n","<P>17       Q.   The same witness says on page 18260, \"Seselj's men had beards and\n","<P>18    cockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to\n","<P>19    distribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party.\"\n","<P>20       A.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb\n","<P>21    Radical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly\n","<P>22    clean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not\n","<P>23    bring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot\n","<P>24    be synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for\n","<P>25    ideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    not a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier\n","<P> 2    having a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not\n","<P> 3    distribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role\n","<P> 4    in these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.\n","<P> 5            Members of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but\n","<P> 6    exclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.\n","<P> 7       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now\n","<P> 8    I'm asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were\n","<P> 9    not Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were\n","<P>10    held at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you\n","<P>11    know anything about that?\n","<P>12       A.   I don't know about those particular localities, but I've already\n","<P>13    talked about Mauzer's and Arkan's conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for\n","<P>14    that reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often\n","<P>15    attacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.\n","<P>16       Q.   I'm sorry that I didn't draw your attention to this on time,\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you\n","<P>18    are being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in\n","<P>19    Batkovic.\n","<P>20       A.   I've already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb\n","<P>21    Radical Party there.\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.\n","<P>23            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic\n","<P>24    testified here, and he made those assertions here, and I'm linking that up\n","<P>25    with --\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness\n","<P> 2    made the allegations here.\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp\n","<P> 4    near Bijeljina.  And I've linked that up to what the indictment against\n","<P> 5    Mr. Seselj says.\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that's not relevant.  Move on.\n","<P> 7            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.\n","<P> 8            JUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused\n","<P> 9    Mr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a\n","<P>10    hundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?\n","<P>11            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.\n","<P>12            JUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it's not relevant to\n","<P>13    this case.\n","<P>14            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the\n","<P>15    basis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks\n","<P>16    about Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in\n","<P>17    Mr. Seselj's indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane\n","<P>18    treatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in\n","<P>19    Seselj's indictment?\n","<P>20            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>21            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the\n","<P>23    International Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything\n","<P>24    about this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?\n","<P>25       A.   I don't know anything about the visit of the International Red\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Cross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.\n","<P> 2    Also, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of\n","<P> 3    prisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not\n","<P> 4    take part in any such thing.\n","<P> 5            As for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and\n","<P> 6    if there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would\n","<P> 7    have to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.\n","<P> 8       Q.   All right.  I'm not going to ask you about this anymore.  You\n","<P> 9    mentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is\n","<P>10    that right?\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.\n","<P>12       Q.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the\n","<P>13    activity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the\n","<P>14    situation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,\n","<P>15    do you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?\n","<P>16       A.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no\n","<P>17    paramilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in\n","<P>18    Mostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,\n","<P>19    from the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical\n","<P>20    Party were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them\n","<P>21    as highly disciplined on Belgrade television.\n","<P>22            If there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have\n","<P>23    been members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention\n","<P>24    platoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not\n","<P>25    preclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    was not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp\n","<P> 3    there were Seselj's Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;\n","<P> 4    transcript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?\n","<P> 5       A.   That is absolutely impossible.  I've never heard of the White\n","<P> 6    Eagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven't heard of this Buna\n","<P> 7    camp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","<P> 8    Party, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared\n","<P> 9    in Buna.  I don't know anything about this, but there should be proper\n","<P>10    records to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White\n","<P>11    Eagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any\n","<P>12    Red Berets.\n","<P>13       Q.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in\n","<P>14    Nevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?\n","<P>15       A.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I\n","<P>16    was in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and\n","<P>17    in the Neretva valley.\n","<P>18       Q.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?\n","<P>19       A.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in\n","<P>20    Nevesinje.\n","<P>21       Q.   That will do.\n","<P>22       A.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable\n","<P>23    number of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no\n","<P>24    conflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large\n","<P>25    number of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    were put up at various facilities there.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Do you know anything about a lake, Boracko Jezero, and a rest\n","<P> 3    house there where about 19 persons were killed, according to the\n","<P> 4    allegations made?\n","<P> 5       A.   I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers\n","<P> 6    of the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That's close to\n","<P> 7    Konjic.  I've already said that there were members of the Serb guard\n","<P> 8    there.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was\n","<P> 9    there, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was\n","<P>10    operating.\n","<P>11       Q.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan's Serb\n","<P>12    volunteer guard?\n","<P>13       A.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.\n","<P>14       Q.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?\n","<P>15       A.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared\n","<P>16    elsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities\n","<P>17    had a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because\n","<P>18    they stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then\n","<P>19    they appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a\n","<P>20    lot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic's.  As far as I\n","<P>21    know, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.\n","<P>22       Q.   Mr. Seselj --\n","<P>23       A.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav\n","<P>24    Lajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.\n","<P>25       Q.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   The Serb guard.\n","<P> 2       Q.   Of Vuk Draskovic?\n","<P> 3       A.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from\n","<P> 4    Novi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made\n","<P> 6    to the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.  I've forgotten\n","<P> 7    his first name.\n","<P> 8       A.   Jovan.\n","<P> 9       Q.   Jovan Dulovic who testified here.  Mr. Robinson instructed me to\n","<P>10    find the original documents that can be linked up to your submissions\n","<P>11    since they refused to admit your submissions.\n","<P>12            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I am sorry, Mr. Robinson.  If you're\n","<P>13    telling me to have copies made I will do that, but I've just received\n","<P>14    these copies.  This is a series of photocopies of articles written by\n","<P>15    Jovan Dulovic and published in Ekspres Politika from the 16th of November,\n","<P>16    the 26th of November, all of that in 1991.  Then the 18th of November, the\n","<P>17    2nd of November.  So from November 1991.\n","<P>18            In these articles, he speaks very favourably of the JNA and\n","<P>19    commends their behaviour in the fighting around Vukovar.  For example, he\n","<P>20    says that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats, saw the light of\n","<P>21    the day after having stayed in cellars for many --\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, what is the question?\n","<P>23            MR. NICE:  And, Your Honour, if I may interrupt, if there's going\n","<P>24    to be a reference to and quotation from a newspaper article, it has to be\n","<P>25    on the overhead projector.  It then has to be available to us to read it\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    in full should we wish to.\n","<P> 2            JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's -- that's the practice, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P> 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.\n","<P> 4            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 5       Q.   Mr. Seselj, since I have only one copy of these articles and I've\n","<P> 6    just received that, could the usher please place them on the ELMO, and\n","<P> 7    then you can have a look at least at some of the parts that have been\n","<P> 8    marked.  Reference is made to Major Sljivancanin here, too, in a very\n","<P> 9    favourable light.  Gratitude for assistance to civilians, Croats, at that,\n","<P>10    and so on and so forth.  Please look at this series of articles.\n","<P>11            In order to answer my question, are these at least partly articles\n","<P>12    that you relied on when you wrote those submissions to the other side\n","<P>13    about the untruthful testimony of Jovan Dulovic or, rather, the difference\n","<P>14    in -- between his reporting then and his testimony here about Vukovar?\n","<P>15            MR. NICE:  Your Honour, that was a leading but nevertheless it's\n","<P>16    interesting to see what the articles actually say.  And if it becomes\n","<P>17    relevant to consider their admissibility as evidence, I know the Chamber\n","<P>18    will have in mind its open recent ruling in respect of the documents of\n","<P>19    Jasovic and the potential evidential value or not as evidence of these\n","<P>20    documents, but I'm most interested frankly in seeing what they actually\n","<P>21    say.\n","<P>22            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let's get it on the overhead projector.\n","<P>23            There appears to be a technical problem.  We're not seeing\n","<P>24    anything.\n","<P>25            Mr. Milosevic, the technician is being called.  He's coming in.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    So move on to another question.  We'll come back to this.\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am sorry, but my\n","<P> 3    next question also has to do with something that Mr. Seselj already\n","<P> 4    testified about and the document that I obtained in the meantime and that\n","<P> 5    would also have to be placed on the ELMO.  That is --\n","<P> 6            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,\n","<P> 7    because the overhead projector is not working.\n","<P> 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further\n","<P> 9    questions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except\n","<P>10    for this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a\n","<P>11    decision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were\n","<P>12    presented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal\n","<P>13    government said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was\n","<P>14    known who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.\n","<P>15    The 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.  So it is about\n","<P>16    40 days after the coup d'etat of the 5th of October, 2000.  It was then\n","<P>17    that they were all released, set free.\n","<P>18            So wanted to show you this document, and I wanted to hand out\n","<P>19    copies to you.  I've just received this.  They are all in the Serbian\n","<P>20    language but they can be placed on the ELMO to show what the government\n","<P>21    spokesman had said was completely disregarded, and these persons mentioned\n","<P>22    in the criminal report against Erdemovic were set free.\n","<P>23            JUDGE ROBINSON:  The ELMO is working now, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>24            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>25       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please take a look at this.  This is a series of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    articles from Ekspres Politika.  Can you see the date of the newspaper?\n","<P> 2       A.   It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of\n","<P> 3    November.\n","<P> 4       Q.   1991; right?\n","<P> 5       A.   1991.\n","<P> 6       Q.   Unless this is a leading question.\n","<P> 7       A.   It's illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one\n","<P> 8    of the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when\n","<P> 9    preparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.\n","<P>10    That is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of\n","<P>11    Evidence and Procedure.\n","<P>12       Q.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the\n","<P>13    subheading?\n","<P>14       A.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both\n","<P>15    Serbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars\n","<P>16    for a long time.  \"Light finally,\" is the heading.  And then in the\n","<P>17    subheading:  \"Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas.\"  And then there's\n","<P>18    another bit saying, \"In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,\"\n","<P>19    and then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, \"I cannot believe\n","<P>20    that we are alive,\" and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated\n","<P>21    the town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.\n","<P>22            THE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of\n","<P>23    the question was not heard by the interpreters.\n","<P>24            JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.  The interpreters have\n","<P>25    indicated that you're overlapping and so she did not hear the beginning of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    the last question.  Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P> 2            And please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.\n","<P> 3            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 4       Q.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.\n","<P> 5    Perhaps it's easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text\n","<P> 6    is.\n","<P> 7       A.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as\n","<P> 8    follows:  \"A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total\n","<P> 9    of 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity.\"\n","<P>10    That's what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and\n","<P>11    Croats equally.  Civilians, that is.\n","<P>12            I can't read the first paragraph because it's quite illegible, but\n","<P>13    it seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,\n","<P>14    that several ambulances were waiting to help.  \"It would not be a good\n","<P>15    thing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now.\"\n","<P>16            So Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of\n","<P>17    Vukovar before the fighting had stopped.\n","<P>18       Q.   Can you see the subtitle which says \"The cruel major\"?\n","<P>19       A.   Yes.\n","<P>20       Q.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this\n","<P>21    refers to and what it says about this cruel major.\n","<P>22       A.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians\n","<P>23    very nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that\n","<P>24    surprised this Croat woman, and he says:  \"No knows what she as a Croat\n","<P>25    heard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers.\"  So he's describing the\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    behaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what\n","<P> 2    Croatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very\n","<P> 3    bad way.\n","<P> 4            And then Major Sljivancanin says:  \"Whenever you need anything,\n","<P> 5    look for me and I'll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to\n","<P> 6    go, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full\n","<P> 7    of gratitude.\"  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  \"He had\n","<P> 8    followed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude.\"\n","<P> 9            All this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now\n","<P>10    Colonel Veselin Sljivancanin.\n","<P>11       Q.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic\n","<P>12    describes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, \"Take this\n","<P>13    child to hospital immediately.\"\n","<P>14       A.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, \"Take this child to the\n","<P>15    hospital in Negoslavci right away,\" Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing\n","<P>16    the ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  \"Let her be given\n","<P>17    assistance and medicine.\"\n","<P>18            A little later Vlatka's mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for\n","<P>19    her daughter in the crowd.  \"Where is my child?  What have they done to\n","<P>20    her?  Where have they taken her,\" Verica was crying out.\n","<P>21            \"Don't be afraid.  She is in hospital,\" Sljivancanin said.  The\n","<P>22    frightened woman didn't believe it.\"  This is followed by Dulovic's\n","<P>23    comment:  \"Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA\n","<P>24    soldiers.\"\n","<P>25       Q.   And what does it say then?\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   \"Get into my car.  I'll take you to the hospital so you can see\n","<P> 2    your child and reassure yourself that everything is all right.  They both\n","<P> 3    entered the vehicle.  In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and\n","<P> 4    dressed Vlatka's wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the\n","<P> 5    daughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them.\"\n","<P> 6       Q.   So this is Dulovic's report from the Vukovar war theatre.\n","<P> 7       A.   Yes.\n","<P> 8       Q.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on\n","<P> 9    the following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points\n","<P>10    are.  This large title, this heading, that is.\n","<P>11       A.   Yes.  Now it's been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a\n","<P>12    statement, \"I believed in the army.\"  And what's in the subtitle.  \"A\n","<P>13    little less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in\n","<P>14    Vukovar.\"  And then there's a quotation.\n","<P>15       A.   \"We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the\n","<P>16    guards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the\n","<P>17    hospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims.\"\n","<P>18       Q.   And look what it says in the article.\n","<P>19       A.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the\n","<P>20    following:  \"In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and\n","<P>21    barricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house\n","<P>22    number 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,\n","<P>23    Milos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.  A few days\n","<P>24    later, the members of the guards burst into the cellar.  These were\n","<P>25    members of the Croatian National Guard Corps.  Get out or we'll throw a\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    bomb in.  The Chetniks are coming.  They're cutting everyone's throats.\n","<P> 2    We're taking you to a shelter.\"\n","<P> 3       Q.   It's quite illegible.  Could you put some light on it?\n","<P> 4            Look at the passages marked in yellow.  You don't have to read it\n","<P> 5    all out, just a few passages.\n","<P> 6       A.    \"Several of us -- or, rather, above us on the cemetery the guards\n","<P> 7    members were stationed.  Milka Vidovic said, 'When they visited us in the\n","<P> 8    cellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone's throats.  We\n","<P> 9    Serbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the\n","<P>10    only thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.  I\n","<P>11    believed in our army and I believed they would arrive.'\"\n","<P>12            JUDGE ROBINSON:  What's the question in relation to this,\n","<P>13    Mr. Milosevic?\n","<P>14            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>15       Q.   Mr. Seselj, what is the signature marked in yellow here?\n","<P>16       A.   Jovan Dulovic.  The same Jovan Dulovic who four or five years\n","<P>17    later changed his version by -- he turned around by 180 degrees because he\n","<P>18    has become a mercenary of the Western intelligence services, and he writes\n","<P>19    for the magazine Vreme which is the Belgrade branch of Western\n","<P>20    intelligence agencies.\n","<P>21       Q.   Mr. Seselj, when you glanced through this article and you dealt\n","<P>22    with it in your submission, is there a single word here which does not\n","<P>23    speak favourably of the JNA and the people who fought in Vukovar?\n","<P>24       A.   No.  The texts are all exceptionally favourable, full of praise\n","<P>25    for the soldiers and officers of the JNA during the fighting for Vukovar.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Would you look at the next page, please.  Let's just see what the\n","<P> 2    date is.\n","<P> 3       A.   The 18th, I suppose.  The 18th of November.\n","<P> 4       Q.   Well, move on.  Move on.\n","<P> 5       A.   Mr. Milosevic, Dulovic says here one day with volunteers and tank\n","<P> 6    crews in the street fighting for the liberation of Vukovar.  He praises\n","<P> 7    the volunteers who participated in the fighting for Vukovar as part of the\n","<P> 8    JNA.  So this should be noted.\n","<P> 9            Next page, please.  I think that it's very important to point this\n","<P>10    out.\n","<P>11       Q.   And the signature is Jovan Dulovic.  What's the title of this\n","<P>12    article?\n","<P>13       A.   The title of this article is \"The Knights of Vukovar.\"\n","<P>14       Q.   And who does it refer to?\n","<P>15       A.   The units of Major Borivoje Tesic on the front line in Vukovar.\n","<P>16    Major Borivoje Tesic I think -- says: \"I think this is the last stage of\n","<P>17    the fighting.  Crews carrying out their tasks successfully and the help of\n","<P>18    brave people is indispensable.\"  It speaks of Croatian Ustasha and so on.\n","<P>19       Q.   Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic\n","<P>22    said volunteers as part of JNA.  Could you show us the passage where\n","<P>23    Mr. Dulovic said so?\n","<P>24            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He says here:  \"One day with\n","<P>25    volunteers and tank crews in the street fighting for the liberation of\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Vukovar.\"  This is above the headline.\n","<P> 2            Then he goes on to say:  \"Speaking favourably of Stanko Vujanovic,\n","<P> 3    he says the commander of the 1st Company of the Territorial Defence of\n","<P> 4    Vukovar who is said to be a man who knows no fear.\" It's quite difficult\n","<P> 5    to read this.  My eyesight is not so good and this is not very legible.\n","<P> 6            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P> 7       Q.   Can it be enlarged?\n","<P> 8       A.   \"With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making\n","<P> 9    openings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze\n","<P>10    through and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.  The house in\n","<P>11    which they stopped in Prugomijska [phoen] Street near the Brdo cafe is\n","<P>12    under constant fire by snipers whose positionings are very difficult to\n","<P>13    discern.\"\n","<P>14            JUDGE KWON:  Now, Mr. Seselj, I would like see to see the passage\n","<P>15    which shows that they were part of JNA as you indicated.  Or was it your\n","<P>16    comment?\n","<P>17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  Please.  In the entire text the\n","<P>18    volunteers are spoken of as members of the JNA.  We have passage here in\n","<P>19    the third column where it says it's in the late afternoon and the fighting\n","<P>20    is dying down.  The volunteers --\n","<P>21            JUDGE KWON:  Could you use the pointer.  And you indicate on the\n","<P>22    newspaper on the ELMO, not your monitor.  Yes.\n","<P>23            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] \"It's late in the afternoon and the\n","<P>24    fighting is dying down.  The volunteers have pierced deep, and they have\n","<P>25    conquered territory between the enemy forces.  The fighters will stay here\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    until the morning.  There were no casualties today except for one soldier\n","<P> 2    who was killed, and his name was Vignjevic.\"\n","<P> 3            He then says:  \"We are going back while shells are flying over our\n","<P> 4    heads and Howitzer shells and so on.\"\n","<P> 5            This whole text implies that the volunteers why part of the JNA.\n","<P> 6    Mr. Kwon, you have here an order showing that these volunteers joined the\n","<P> 7    1st Guards Brigade.  The order was delivered to the OTP from Belgrade and\n","<P> 8    it's beyond dispute.\n","<P> 9            In the Vukovar, there were no troops outside the JNA.  There were\n","<P>10    no paramilitary units.\n","<P>11            JUDGE KWON:  It is your comment.  I really didn't see any\n","<P>12    concrete -- the description these volunteers as part of JNA by\n","<P>13    Mr. Dulovic.\n","<P>14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have to read the whole text and\n","<P>15    everything will become clear to you.\n","<P>16            JUDGE KWON:  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","<P>17            MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","<P>18       Q.   Look at the next page, please.  The following text or this one\n","<P>19    again says the Knights of Vukovar, Major Borivoje Tesic's units on the\n","<P>20    front line, and this is a large article which seems not to be by Dulovic,\n","<P>21    but on the left-hand side there is a small one:  \"Brave commander falls,\n","<P>22    Borovo Selo.\"  Would you look at the signature?  I believe it's by\n","<P>23    Dulovic.  Could you scroll up?\n","<P>24       A.   Yes.\n","<P>25       Q.   What does it say in the passage marked by yellow?\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       A.   The initials \"JD\" mean Jovan Dulovic.\n","<P> 2       Q.   And what does it say in this last passage?\n","<P> 3       A.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- \"The inhabitants of the\n","<P> 4    Crepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,\n","<P> 5    who with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village\n","<P> 6    and one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the\n","<P> 7    highest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages.\"\n","<P> 8       Q.   And he was killed?\n","<P> 9       A.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives\n","<P>10    him.  Next page.\n","<P>11       Q.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a\n","<P>12    look?  I haven't had time to look at it all carefully.\n","<P>13       A.   Yes.  There's a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of\n","<P>14    November.  \"Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate\n","<P>15    Vukovar.\"\n","<P>16            In these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate\n","<P>17    Vukovar, and five years later he's saying something completely different.\n","<P>18             \"Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in\n","<P>19    Vukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb.\"  And then it\n","<P>20    says:  \"The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back,\" and so on\n","<P>21    and so forth.\n","<P>22            So this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the\n","<P>23    JNA.\n","<P>24       Q.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It's been circled.\n","<P>25       A.   Yes.\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1       Q.   Very well.\n","<P> 2       A.   The 4th of November, 1991.  \"For two days fierce fighting has not\n","<P> 3    stopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in\n","<P> 4    flames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of\n","<P> 5    Njusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the\n","<P> 6    Territorial Defence.  Advances by Territorial Defence units and volunteers\n","<P> 7    from the direction of Trpinja stopped on the edge of Borovo Naselje.\"\n","<P> 8            He then speaks of a Croatian mortar attack on Bobota [phoen] and\n","<P> 9    so on.\n","<P>10       Q.   Is this another report by Dulovic?\n","<P>11       A.   Yes, it's signed by Jovan Dulovic.\n","<P>12       Q.   Is there anything else, any other report?\n","<P>13       A.   I'm looking at another text here but I can't see whether it's by\n","<P>14    Dulovic or not because it's not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian\n","<P>15    volunteer guard but again a very favourable text.  I couldn't see -- I\n","<P>16    can't see the name of the author here.  I can't see it on this page.\n","<P>17       Q.   Is there anything else underneath, another report?\n","<P>18       A.   \"Who are the volunteers,\" is the next title.\n","<P>19       Q.   Well, I can't see anything anymore.\n","<P>20       A.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced\n","<P>21    through the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is \"Through the holes\n","<P>22    to the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?\n","<P>23    Unknown ammunition with inhumane bullets.\"\n","<P>24            What happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used\n","<P>25    weapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    because the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal\n","<P> 2    organs.\n","<P> 3       Q.   Mr. Seselj, I can't see what it says here in yellow, highlighted\n","<P> 4    in yellow.\n","<P> 5       A.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It's Major Radic now\n","<P> 6    who also stands accused in The Hague.  \"Throughout the month of October,\n","<P> 7    the fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in\n","<P> 8    the clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least\n","<P> 9    one person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja\n","<P>10    [phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in\n","<P>11    that way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had\n","<P>12    taken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.\n","<P>13    The snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own\n","<P>14    control and then a solution was found to move through the houses.\"\n","<P>15       Q.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic's article\n","<P>16    again?\n","<P>17       A.   Well, it's not legible but it is a series of articles by him.  We\n","<P>18    can't find a signature here but quite obviously it is a series of articles\n","<P>19    by him.\n","<P>20       Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  Is that a series of articles to which you\n","<P>21    referred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect\n","<P>22    to Dulovic's testimony?\n","<P>23       A.   Yes.  But this isn't the complete material.  My legal advisors\n","<P>24    found many more texts of this kind and they quote them in extenso, and in\n","<P>25    my submission I state my intention to disclose them in keeping with\n","\n","\n","\n","<P> 1    Rule 67 of the rules of evidence.\n","<P> 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, I have one more question\n","<P> 3    [as interpreted] -- Robinson, I have a question for you.

[Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some\n","questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian\n","indictment, that have to do with the \"Rump Presidency\" as it's called\n","here.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  \"The Rump Presidency\n","carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies,\" and so on and so forth, \"had\n","\n","\n","\n","effect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief.\"\n","I'm not going to ask you to repeat what you've already said, but\n","in relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of\n","Serbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they\n","not take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency\n","of the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any\n","objective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from\n","carrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?\n","The question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,\n","Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the\n","SFRY Presidency in Belgrade?\n","A.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,\n","staying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was\n","never a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from\n","carrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped\n","coming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had\n","practically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe\n","Mesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying\n","that they could not come because they could not strike a balance in\n","relation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and\n","Montenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.\n","The representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were\n","not expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was\n","actually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display\n","such feelings at the time.  It's only when he left Belgrade and when he\n","\n","\n","\n","came back to the Croatian parliament that he said, \"I've completed my\n","duty.  Yugoslavia is no more.\"\n","He pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.\n","Also, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him\n","sufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he\n","condemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most\n","cooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was\n","what he was.\n","I already said that according to the constitution of the then\n","Yugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one\n","single member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been\n","prevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could\n","have gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could\n","have refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the\n","Presidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the\n","Presidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed\n","within the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably\n","before Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a\n","Rump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of\n","a rump Presidency.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  \"Slobodan Milosevic,\n","in his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that\n","Yugoslavia was finished.\"\n","\n","\n","\n","Please, you've got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I'm not\n","going to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much\n","time.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to\n","here or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that\n","Yugoslavia was finished?\n","A.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say\n","that Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you\n","never said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I\n","remember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the\n","behaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went\n","through a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,\n","constitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,\n","but then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional\n","provision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases\n","to exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the\n","matter.\n","The leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never\n","did it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and\n","Croatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and\n","Macedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro\n","proclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting\n","of two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration\n","on your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   \"In March 1991 the collective Presidency of the SFRY reached a\n","deadlock on several issues.\"  That is paragraph 56.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... that sentence\n","which is at the beginning of the paragraph.  There's another allegation in\n","that last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no\n","longer be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask\n","Mr. Seselj whether that is so.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember\n","at that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian\n","public, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the\n","decisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that\n","Serbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation\n","when the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.\n","I would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there\n","was a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the\n","headquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long\n","debate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the\n","demand of the military to declare a state of emergency.\n","The top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the\n","behaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a\n","vote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.  As far as I can\n","remember --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  You have answered the question I asked, thanks.\n","Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   That is what is referred to here.  It says the representatives on\n","the Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,\n","the autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of\n","Kosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what\n","was so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the\n","Presidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?\n","A.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also\n","start the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven't got the document here\n","so I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were\n","actually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already\n","started putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the\n","Presidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the\n","Presidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not\n","very constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the\n","Presidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,\n","or Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.\n","I think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been\n","recalled in the meantime.\n","Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that\n","session or before that session or in relation to that session I never\n","declared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did\n","they declare that Yugoslavia was finished?\n","A.   I've already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian\n","politicians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was\n","one of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be\n","\n","\n","\n","hard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.\n","As for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in\n","Montenegro either.\n","Q.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to\n","normal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic\n","was elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented\n","Vojvodina at the time.\n","A.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the\n","Presidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started\n","working again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its\n","work.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of\n","Bosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil\n","Tupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new\n","crisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be\n","elected president of the Presidency.\n","There was a principle involved that the president of the\n","Presidency was elected from a different republican province every year but\n","nobody's election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic\n","did not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European\n","envoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to\n","elect him nevertheless.\n","Q.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?\n","A.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting\n","the preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from\n","those positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says\n","that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and\n","discussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between\n","Serbia and Croatia?\n","A.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I\n","remember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what\n","was skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching\n","agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the\n","Bosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a\n","situation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it\n","increasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the\n","country at the time.\n","At that time, I -- as I've already said, the presidents of the\n","presidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys\n","had actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach\n","agreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia\n","increasingly so.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through\n","what medium?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully\n","being bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media\n","this kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were\n","already at that time being financed from the West by different Western\n","intelligence agencies, so that's the kind of media I'm talking about.  In\n","Belgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a\n","\n","\n","\n","federal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic\n","government, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government\n","in Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the\n","Western powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante\n","Markovic's government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible\n","agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia\n","together under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been\n","eliminated.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at\n","one stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence\n","counsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest\n","collaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This\n","denies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of\n","Bosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted\n","into evidence and if not we will find this transcript.\n","However, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with\n","you as you were an active participant in all political events.  This\n","meeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the\n","division of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any\n","member of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning\n","of which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way\n","even indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?\n","A.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even\n","\n","\n","\n","if Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia\n","as an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as\n","a constituent nation as they had been before in the previous\n","constitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the\n","first president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it\n","was not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint\n","state.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans\n","persuaded him to call off the agreement.\n","Q.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It\n","says:  \"On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY\n","Presidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,\n","Sejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY\n","Presidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the\n","Presidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and\n","Macedonia.\"\n","On the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.  Was this\n","a kind of takeover of the function of the Presidency or were these\n","functions being carried out by the legal representatives?\n","A.   There was absolutely no takeover.  When four of the members of the\n","Presidency withdrew and some of them officially gave notice that they were\n","no longer members, like Drnovsek, for instance, while others simply\n","stopped attending the sessions.  The Presidency continued working with the\n","members who -- whom it was possible to gather together.\n","I suggest that the Chamber get hold of this piece of legislation.\n","I cannot quote it verbatim right now, but I'm absolutely sure it existed.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","And according to this piece of legislation, even if the majority of\n","members could not meet, the Presidency under certain circumstances would\n","continue working with the members who were present.\n","Let me remind you that in the spring of 1991 or in the early\n","summer, there was a vote taken to declare a imminent threat of war.\n","Q.   In paragraph 65 it says:  \"On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,\n","Slobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal\n","enterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from\n","Belgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the\n","mobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay\n","in Yugoslavia.\"\n","First of all, let's establish when I began advocating a unitary\n","Serb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And\n","secondly, was this anyone's idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,\n","and is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever\n","been a unitary state?\n","A.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as\n","Yugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally\n","and your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt\n","the new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the\n","autonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the\n","Serb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of\n","autonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an\n","option.\n","Furthermore, when the four former federal units had already been\n","\n","\n","\n","recognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the\n","Montenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be\n","promulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump\n","Yugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would\n","have been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -\n","because that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary\n","Serbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this\n","but didn't want to, and I am sorry that you didn't do that, because up to\n","the point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --\n","in Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It\n","appeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.\n","Q.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any\n","of my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who\n","were allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had\n","any kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?\n","A.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated\n","with you advocated such an idea.\n","Q.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it\n","says here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of\n","reservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the\n","reasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was\n","called for?\n","A.   I'm not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation\n","of reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to\n","mobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA\n","\n","\n","\n","to take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the\n","territorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that\n","this mobilisation didn't go well.  The response was very poor, because\n","Veljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn't want to remove the\n","communist insignia from the military uniforms.\n","The Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the\n","Presidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was\n","Prime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in\n","Slovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of\n","such an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops\n","into Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then\n","leadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as\n","I know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership\n","which had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.\n","Q.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your\n","name, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask\n","you now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of\n","April, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan's and\n","Seselj's men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you\n","know anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and\n","cart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of\n","cooperation with Arkan's volunteer guard?\n","A.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","did not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert\n","that, I'm saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no\n","\n","\n","\n","organised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as\n","much as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.\n","That's a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb\n","Radical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty\n","to Serbia.  I guarantee that.\n","The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict\n","instructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb\n","volunteer guard up to the --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm asking why was that instruction given to the\n","volunteers of the Serb Radical Party?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.\n","We didn't want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn't\n","want people's awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.\n","As I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,\n","long before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had\n","quarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was\n","in danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this\n","in the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding\n","that instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with\n","Arkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You're\n","not there with them.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can't say that not a single\n","volunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There's one\n","instance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a\n","\n","\n","\n","teacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical\n","Party.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of\n","about 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back\n","but, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of\n","Arkan's men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.\n","So, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint\n","military activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with\n","Arkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a\n","distance from Arkan.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.\n","Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on\n","transcript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia\n","took place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj's\n","White Eagles.\n","First of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and\n","secondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj's White Eagles?\n","A.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb\n","people organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have\n","already said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of\n","volunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After\n","that, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we\n","had volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never\n","had anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.\n","\n","\n","\n","There was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo\n","Selo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he\n","was killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not\n","carrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no\n","joint military activities.\n","Q.   Let's clarify this.  It doesn't say here that you cooperated.  It\n","says here:  \"With infiltration of Seselj's White Eagles.\"  So the White\n","Eagles are being ascribed to you.\n","A.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the\n","Prosecutor bringing witnesses here who don't no anything about what\n","happened on the ground.  It's simply nonsense to talk of a group called\n","Seselj's White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and\n","the Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn't know\n","what he was talking about.\n","Q.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,\n","2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that \"Seselj collected men in\n","Erdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia.\"  Is that\n","true, Mr. Seselj?\n","JUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493\n","who testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake\n","in my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that\n","particular page, and the page is 19003.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send\n","\n","\n","\n","them to Bosnia?\n","A.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in\n","Erdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,\n","nicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only\n","time.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --\n","we never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there\n","either, and I can state that quite categorically.\n","The people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the\n","war and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were\n","exclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I\n","absolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan's centre in Erdut\n","later on.  We never had anything to do with it.\n","Q.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is\n","20294, says that Arkan's and Seselj's men shot above the heads of the\n","civilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in\n","Bratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who\n","mistreated and abused the civilians?\n","A.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian\n","Radical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my\n","knowledge Arkan didn't appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in\n","Zvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in\n","Bratunac either.  And I've already said that in Bratunac there was\n","Deronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there\n","I was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have\n","very certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj's men were\n","in Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj's\n","mean there is no difference, says he.\n","A.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can't see any\n","difference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the\n","White Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at\n","all.  And that's not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some\n","judgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to\n","see in some other places Seselj's White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the\n","problem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses\n","which it manipulates.\n","Q.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on\n","several occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --\n","MR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven't been able to check this myself\n","because the accused hasn't been getting the references correct, and it's\n","quite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I'm grateful to\n","Ms. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came\n","(redacted).\n","But, really, I'm afraid we've got to have correct references for the\n","witnesses.  We can't simply just go to the page in the transcript.\n","Frequently our page numbers don't necessarily coincide here in court, and\n","without reference to the witnesses it's very difficult to pick it up\n","later.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in\n","pinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you're referring.  Now,\n","\n","\n","\n","Judge Kwon has already corrected you once, and apparently there is another\n","mistake in the reference.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, perhaps there might be a\n","mistake with the name, but there is no mistake with the quotation from the\n","transcript, and my question relates to the material facts which are being\n","mentioned here.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, we have to follow it, Mr. Milosevic.  There\n","is duty on you to be more careful.\n","Please proceed.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. Robinson.  And I'll\n","check this out to see whether indeed it is the same witness from\n","page 20352, the transcript line and page, the quotation that I mentioned\n","earlier on or, rather, 20351 is the exact number.  I'll check that out\n","during the break.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript\n","said that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of\n","March, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan's men took part as well as\n","Seselj's men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the\n","occupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on\n","the 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of\n","your volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?\n","A.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What\n","happened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between\n","the JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The\n","\n","\n","\n","Muslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.\n","However, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went\n","on for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting\n","the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was\n","there, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my\n","knowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of\n","the local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to\n","establish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the\n","ground there.\n","I know -- have reliable information that the commands and the\n","officers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan's and\n","the Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a\n","great deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very\n","rarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.\n","As far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,\n","over there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did\n","appear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the\n","call of Biljana Plavsic.  I can't prove that, but I do know that Biljana\n","Plavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly\n","meeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The\n","volunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina\n","were not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the\n","Serbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were\n","residents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the\n","conflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves\n","\n","\n","\n","and Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan's right-hand man.  And in\n","Serbia we didn't send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something\n","for me in relation to the Prosecution's case.  In the Bosnia indictment\n","the allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other\n","members of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the\n","Prosecution case unfolded, you're not saying, are you, that he acted\n","alone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with\n","other members of the joint criminal enterprise.\n","MR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven't reviewed each and every allegation\n","to check that there isn't one there that may be susceptible to individual\n","perpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he's working with others.\n","MR. NICE:  Yes.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually\n","your case.  It's not that he acted alone.\n","MR. NICE:  Subject to the point I've just made.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you've made, yes.\n","MR. NICE:  Yes.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Very well, Mr. Seselj.  You've just heard that explanation too.\n","Now, since you know the relationships very well between people at that\n","time, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and\n","Zvornik yourself.  Now, did I or any organs of power and authority have\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","anything to do with Arkan's volunteer guard?\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet.\n","MR. NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and\n","I think perhaps there's this qualification, although I don't think it is a\n","qualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this\n","accused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top\n","political level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are\n","criminal in nature.  It's the standard method of generation of\n","genocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar\n","[phoen].\n","Now, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other\n","people.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may\n","be minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in\n","those circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting\n","alone in certain circumstances, but that's the only qualification I think\n","I should make.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it's a point that will warrant some\n","consideration later on, yes.\n","Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   So Arkan is mentioned here as well as Mauzer.  Did I or anybody\n","else from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all\n","and with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?\n","A.   I'm quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.\n","On the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open\n","\n","\n","\n","contacts with Arkan.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many\n","questions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the\n","evidence he's giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,\n","how is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan\n","or Mauzer?\n","He's giving evidence.  He's saying that you had nothing to do with\n","him.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to\n","establish how he's in a position to make that statement.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that\n","cannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from\n","the authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or\n","relationship with Arkan or Mauzer?\n","A.   In Belgrade you couldn't hide anything like that.  It would be\n","impossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is\n","that kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become\n","public.\n","Second, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts\n","only with Zoran Djindjic.  And I've already spoken about the relationship\n","between Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic's vice-president and the\n","president of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his\n","pre-electoral campaign.\n","Q.   Let's clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did\n","you have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be\n","\n","\n","\n","able to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in\n","Bijeljina?\n","A.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina\n","sufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,\n","including Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this\n","trial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events\n","that went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in\n","Bijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements\n","and held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and\n","severely criticised Mauzer's conduct, especially Mauzer's conduct towards\n","the Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am\n","preparing them for my own trial, which doesn't seem to be starting.\n","Q.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack\n","on the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the\n","JNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by\n","the Red Berets or, rather, Arkan's and Seselj's men.  So that's the\n","quotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan's\n","and Seselj's men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red\n","Berets were they?  What Arkan's men were they, Seselj's men were they\n","around Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?\n","A.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the\n","witness don't seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened\n","to see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red\n","cap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.\n","And then he -- the witness doesn't know whether they were Seselj's men or\n","\n","\n","\n","Arkan's men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it's\n","highly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of\n","his head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify\n","so-called Seselj's men and Arkan's men and these alleged Red Berets.\n","As for the Red Berets, I've already given you reliable facts about\n","them and said that name appeared in different situations relating to\n","different military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina\n","area where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then\n","the army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of\n","the intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until\n","the special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of\n","Serbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this\n","misunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed\n","to people with -- which they had nothing to do with.\n","Q.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the\n","following:  \"Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia\n","who were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done.\"\n","That's when this witness claims.\n","A.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He's a colonel by\n","rank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff\n","of the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the\n","number two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that's the same\n","Osman Selak that you're referring to.\n","Q.   Well, I can't tell you that.\n","A.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of\n","\n","\n","\n","Republika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a\n","statement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,\n","what the circumstances were in which I said it.\n","I did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the\n","secession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia\n","seceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,\n","and for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he\n","personally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.\n","As far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from\n","Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of\n","Yugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and\n","Raska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of\n","examples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army\n","perform their duty very honourably.\n","So the citizens --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are\n","saying that you did make such a statement or you didn't make such a\n","statement.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if\n","you don't show me something like that here, where and when.  Let us see\n","the statement concerned.  Let me identify it.  I gave thousands and\n","thousands of statements in public.  They were publicly recorded.  They\n","were published.  So let's see.\n","My objection is precisely in that.  Why did this Osman Selak not\n","\n","\n","\n","say where and when?\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  That's helpful to some extent.  Does it follow from\n","the answer you've just given that you could have said it?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I could have said it along the\n","following lines, that those in the army who came from the renegade\n","republics in principle should not remain at positions in the Yugoslav\n","army.  You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live\n","in Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in\n","the army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as\n","officers?\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  That's simply confusing me further.  The quote was\n","that you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims\n","and Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that\n","you could possibly have made that statement in these terms?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not saying that I made that kind\n","of statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak\n","testified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise\n","lines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman\n","Selak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be\n","established.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the\n","Prosecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly\n","what I said.\n","I am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,\n","but it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you're asking me to do is\n","to comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman\n","\n","\n","\n","Selak's view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make\n","my statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm\n","trying to understand the answer you've given to the question asked by\n","Mr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you've just said, the problem is\n","that you've been studying this yourself, and you're trying to justify a\n","position of your own without really dealing specifically with the question\n","that's being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears\n","now to be that you couldn't possibly have made a statement of that nature,\n","although you might have said something much more specific about different\n","people but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.\n","Now, is that a fair summary of your position?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I'm not sure, by think you're\n","very close.  However, in order to help you, I'm going to give you an\n","example.\n","Throughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were\n","informed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,\n","escaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of\n","confidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998\n","we had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of\n","the military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his\n","family abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives\n","there.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn't remotely sound as if it's\n","going to be at all helpful to me, so we'll proceed with Mr. Milosevic's\n","\n","\n","\n","questions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you\n","was about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist\n","statement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple\n","issue I'm not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further\n","if he wishes.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in\n","no uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that\n","any statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never\n","in my life have I made a racist statement.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  There's nothing for you to respond to.\n","Mr. Milosevic, the next question.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, I'm afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I\n","put a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific\n","terms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated\n","\n","\n","\n","here that \"Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia\n","who were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed.\"  Did you ever state\n","that?\n","A.   No, I didn't say it that way.\n","Q.   So you didn't say it that way --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... matter.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  And why on earth it should take all this time to\n","establish that simple issue, I do not know.\n","Perhaps it would help, Mr. Seselj, if you just listened to the\n","questions and answer the question that's actually asked rather than try to\n","make political statements about your own position.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not making political statements,\n","Mr. Bonomy.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He\n","mentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether\n","those facts are correct.  And first of all, I'm interested in the\n","circumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  \"Just after\n","the bombing Seselj came to Pale.\"  And then on page 26762 he\n","says:  \"Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to\n","support the Bosnian Serbs.\"  These are a few facts that referred to.\n","Could you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this\n","actually all about?\n","A.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of\n","\n","\n","\n","Republika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the\n","leadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly\n","engaged in an anti-Serb policy.\n","As for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market\n","itself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the\n","street of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these\n","are explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of\n","whether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar\n","shells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.\n","This was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the\n","Serbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the\n","threats that were made, and so on and so forth.\n","Q.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there\n","you did so only to give political support to the leadership of\n","Republika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and\n","bombing.\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  \"In January or February\n","1992\" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, \"Arkan's\n","and Seselj's units arrived in Doboj.\"\n","Is this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?\n","A.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,\n","there were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.\n","Secondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to\n","Doboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan's Tigers never\n","\n","\n","\n","operated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.\n","Q.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to\n","this question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on\n","transcript page 27738, quite explicitly, \"Mirko Blagojevic,\" that is to\n","say, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he\n","says:  \"Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,\n","and he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with\n","Seselj.\"\n","I am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical\n","Party or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that\n","Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So\n","please deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the\n","transcript.  Is it correct or not?\n","A.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is\n","organised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A\n","conflict occurs when two armed formations clash.\n","Mirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in\n","Bijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim\n","formations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any\n","conflicts.  And I guarantee with my own life that he took part in no\n","looting, no persecutions, no maltreatment of the civilian population and\n","so on and so forth.  I'm absolutely certain of that.\n","Q.   Thank you.\n","A.   I can fully identify with everything that Mirko Blagojevic did.\n","It is to that degree that I'm certain that he never did anything against\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the law.\n","Q.   Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  \"Seselj's\n","men tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm.\"\n","A.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?\n","Q.   My understanding is it's somewhere near Zvornik.\n","A.   That's quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","Party took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there\n","in brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on\n","for a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the\n","Muslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to\n","an end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","withdrew.\n","I preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on\n","guarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing\n","happened, I would have had to know about it.\n","Q.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you\n","personally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following\n","circumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  \"Seselj,\n","on Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired\n","it at Muslims in Sarajevo.\"  This was shown on television, and he said\n","that you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.\n","A.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at\n","Grbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called\n","international observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go\n","around the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the\n","\n","\n","\n","Serb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was\n","an apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I\n","used a Browning machine-gun from there.  It's a heavy machine-gun.  I\n","couldn't carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry\n","it around.\n","Q.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.\n","A.   You cannot carry it.  It's too long.  It was installed in that\n","building, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches\n","below the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of\n","the volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was\n","firing from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and\n","the top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is\n","something I don't know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who\n","could have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this\n","small participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.\n","A Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that\n","case, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been\n","forced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of\n","those who in violation of international law of war brought him out there\n","to dig trenches, not those who --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,\n","that at the beginning of April Seselj's men arrived in the area of\n","Bratunac and Zvornik.\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic's part.  He knows\n","full well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing\n","who he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and\n","making this sweeping statement Seselj's men arrived in Bratunac and\n","Zvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it's as if they were in Bratunac\n","too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so\n","Deronjic invented that.\n","In Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the\n","Bratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was\n","commander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he\n","was not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,\n","then a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.  I think the interpreter is having\n","some difficulty.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will.\n","You could have noticed, Mr. Robinson, that I have been trying as\n","of late to speak slowly, but sometimes, every now and then, I may forget\n","what you cautioned me about.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, I had noticed, and the -- we are\n","appreciative of the effort you are making.  You have answered the\n","question.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the meantime --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think you have answered that question.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   So they were not in Bratunac at all?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in\n","Bratunac.\n","Q.   All right.  So you are saying that he's not telling the truth.\n","The same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not\n","agree that Seselj was a true opposition.\n","A.   The Hague OTP and Judge Schomburg on several occasions caught\n","Deronjic lying.  And even in Deronjic's judgement you can find about seven\n","different points as ascertained by Judge Schomburg, namely that Deronjic\n","was lying.\n","Secondly, in the case of people who are inclined to a pro-Western\n","policy or are mercenaries of Western intelligence agencies, or in order to\n","save their own skin they go into plea bargaining with the OTP and\n","therefore appear as witnesses in the trials of other people, it can often\n","be heard that those who are really opposition but are not prepared to\n","serve the West --\n","MR. NICE:  I'm not sure this is responsive to any question --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Are you interrupting me?\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet, Mr. Seselj, and he's\n","entitled to make an objection if he wishes.\n","MR. NICE:  He was simply asked if the man was telling the truth.\n","We have his answer and he's now gone on to a long comment basically.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, you have moved into the area of comment.\n","It's now time for the break.\n","Mr. Nice, I should say the question that I asked earlier related\n","to the Bosnia indictment.\n","\n","\n","\n","We will break for 20 minutes.\n","--- Recess taken at 3.41 p.m.\n","--- On resuming at 4.08 p.m.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, you told me to check\n","the pages that Mr. Nice mentioned, 35 -- 20352 and 20351, that is.  This\n","was Witness 1070.\n","On page 20351 he says that Seselj's men were in Bratunac and that\n","there was no difference between them and Seselj's men, the White Eagles,\n","that is.\n","And on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April\n","Seselj's and Arkan's men were in Bratunac together when some people were\n","deported.  And Mr. Seselj answered questions about this.  In the meantime,\n","the liaison officer had the transcript, and I have received a note saying\n","that both references are correct, both as regards page 20351 and 20352,\n","and these refer to Witness 1070.  There was no error.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  All right, Mr. Milosevic.  We'll do our own\n","check.  Thank you for checking anyhow.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, this is the testimony of Miroslav Deronjic, who said\n","that you were not truly an opposition politician or, rather, that you\n","cooperated with the government and that therefore this idea of a joint\n","criminal enterprise is thereby confirmed.  Were you in the opposition or\n","not?\n","THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.\n","\n","\n","\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it\n","on.\n","Both the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time\n","were distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as\n","it's possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by\n","Deronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the\n","opposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint\n","often expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various\n","government and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person\n","of the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or\n","Miles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery\n","and so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while\n","criticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition\n","politicians, and this logic is completely upside down.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Witness Ahmet Zulic says, and that's on page 30000 of the\n","transcript, he says that Seselj's men were stationed in the partisan\n","cemetery in Pobrezje, that doesn't matter so much but what matters is the\n","following, that they had come there to kill the Muslims.\n","A.   Where is this place?  Pobrezje?  Where is it?\n","Q.   I have a note here in Pobrezje.  I can't be more specific than\n","that.\n","But let me put a question to you:  Did your volunteers go anywhere\n","to kill all Muslims?\n","A.   No.  Nowhere did the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party go to\n","\n","\n","\n","kill Muslims or Croats or any kind of civilians.  Wherever they went, they\n","were part of the JNA, and they went there to fight against the\n","paramilitary units that wanted to break up Yugoslavia.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, it's important to know the\n","location.  I'm not sure whether Mr. Nice or Mr. Kay can help.  Your note\n","doesn't identify clearly the name of this place?\n","MR. NICE:  I tried to make an electronic search but for various\n","reasons it doesn't work at the moment or doesn't work for this witness on\n","this particular part of his evidence.  I'll try again.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","JUDGE KWON:  You said Pobrezje.\n","Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   The same witness, Ahmet Zulic, on page 30047, says in Sanski Most\n","there was no fighting, but the civilians fled because Seselj's men were\n","there.\n","Your men caused fear among civilians, although there was no\n","fighting there, as he says, in Sanski Most.\n","A.   That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,\n","throughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did\n","not fight in any location.\n","This reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a\n","certain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying\n","that sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.\n","Somebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is\n","\n","\n","\n","arriving, and he spread panic.\n","THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that the Serbian word for\n","sugar resembles Mr. Seselj's name.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere\n","in that area.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  \"From the\n","1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan\n","Milosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint\n","criminal,\" and so on,\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise\n","aided and abetted,\" and so on and so forth, all these phrases, \"the\n","planning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories\n","of Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,\n","Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.\"\n","Tell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in\n","this joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged\n","crimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made\n","here?\n","A.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from\n","Serbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia\n","and Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted\n","to proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the\n","will of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the\n","West who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or\n","execution or extermination.  There was no plan.\n","\n","\n","\n","When the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in\n","many places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only\n","where the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats\n","were in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,\n","not a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the\n","majority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They\n","had already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.\n","Q.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we\n","have already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the\n","other places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,\n","Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in\n","any kind of military activities?\n","A.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in\n","January, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but\n","the UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,\n","although they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was\n","established, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be\n","\n","disarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.\n","The Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian\n","villages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there\n","were two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active\n","in the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces\n","in the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the\n","only activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica\n","area.  It was in the beginning of 1993.\n","\n","\n","\n","As for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,\n","I don't know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up\n","only in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all\n","over Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army\n","of the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska\n","Krajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his\n","volunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars\n","there, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed\n","and what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy\n","that we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in\n","whole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and\n","Herzegovina?\n","A.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and\n","there was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen\n","happened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on\n","their own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit\n","murders or anything of the kind.\n","Q.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war\n","in Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the\n","other participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by\n","Mr. Nice.\n","Look at paragraph 33.  We've just been discussing paragraph 32.  I\n","won't read the beginning of paragraph 33 because it's the same:  \"From on\n","or about the 1st of March, 1992,\" and so on and so forth, and then it\n","\n","\n","\n","says:  \"On the territory of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa,\n","Bosanski Novi, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Sarajevo (Ilijas), Kljuc,\n","Kalinovik, Kotor Varos, Nevesinje, Sarajevo, Novi Grad, Sarajevo, Novo\n","Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Rudo, Sanski Most, Srebrenica\n","again, Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\"  Please --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  You are finished reading that list.  Let me\n","remind you, Mr. Milosevic, that the Rule 98 bis decision found that there\n","was not enough evidence to support the allegation in paragraph 32 in\n","relation to some of the villages or municipalities mentioned.  In fact, as\n","far as paragraph 32 is concerned, you need only concern yourself with\n","Brcko, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Bijeljina, Kotor Varos, Kljuc,\n","Bosanski Novi.  And I am checking to see whether the decision affected\n","paragraph 33.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, could you please let\n","me know what evidence, as you say there was no evidence for these places,\n","but what was the evidence that Mr. Nice presented here about the other\n","places linking me --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.  Mr. Milosevic, the Rule 98 bis\n","decision was published and was available to you.  But I bring that to your\n","attention so we don't waste time.  And I'll ask the legal officer to give\n","me the information in relation to paragraph 33.\n","Go ahead, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   As I was saying, Mr. Seselj, I read out a list here.  It's a long\n","paragraph with all the names of the towns where I, together with others,\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","am charged with working for the extermination of Muslims and Croats.  You\n","know the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that\n","referred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded\n","in any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?\n","A.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted\n","to, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A\n","civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally\n","wanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a\n","constituent people.\n","And the question arises from there where are the Serbs from\n","Mostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from\n","Travnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from\n","many other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats\n","during that civil war?\n","After the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the\n","population, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did\n","take place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,\n","in figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I\n","can put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes\n","crimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,\n","sometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,\n","criminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and\n","revenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes\n","did not exist.  That did not happen.\n","Q.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the\n","\n","\n","\n","joint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I'd like\n","to draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of\n","December, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33\n","and indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns\n","are repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns\n","too.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.\n","So what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during\n","that period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of\n","December 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring\n","Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n","A.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia\n","or, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of\n","Yugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It\n","did not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help\n","materially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs\n","living over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different\n","political relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership\n","of Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in\n","which those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep\n","conflicts, and they didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues.\n","So throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the\n","indictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,\n","the leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered\n","in looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far\n","accepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists\n","\n","\n","\n","attacked ourselves for our part.\n","So I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy\n","dating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact\n","that that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all\n","costs.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no\n","alternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at\n","the price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept\n","because they were not able to take such great concessions.\n","Q.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities\n","of that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these\n","towns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I\n","personally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,\n","et cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason\n","explanation?\n","A.   Yes, I do, and that's explanation is the following and the fact\n","that through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,\n","and --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not\n","an explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.\n","So please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,\n","Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac\n","again, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in\n","Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,\n","\n","\n","\n","Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with\n","regard to that point of the indictment?\n","A.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised\n","crime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don't know whether in all the\n","places enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took\n","place in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each\n","individual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the\n","motives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are\n","still living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can\n","be established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side\n","and the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to\n","investigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to\n","strike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the\n","number of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.\n","Q.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you've said when you said\n","that some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let's look at\n","that for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of\n","Yugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or\n","formations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes\n","that you know of?  Are there any links?\n","A.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of\n","power and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as\n","well, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,\n","the Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the\n","Academy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,\n","\n","\n","\n","everybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out\n","against them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for\n","freedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were\n","being perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes\n","should be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind\n","via the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political\n","parties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which\n","strove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors\n","spoke out against crimes.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Now, we -- let's look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful\n","confinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,\n","Bosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the\n","territories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,\n","Samac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,\n","Kotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,\n","Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\n","Tell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these\n","people in these towns did we take part in?\n","A.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have\n","had anything to do with any such thing.\n","First of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What\n","the confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of\n","civilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is\n","\n","\n","\n","unlawful, and there were such cases.\n","Now, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of\n","all, there were individual instances in some of these places through the\n","self-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance\n","of Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.\n","And then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of\n","their own because they couldn't influence him.  He appeared as a factor,\n","and there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his\n","motives were of a criminal nature.\n","There were other such cases in some of these places whereby\n","somebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in\n","order to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive\n","money and then release them once they received money for that.  There were\n","also instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,\n","somebody's family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or\n","Croats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often\n","were not able to prevent revenge of that kind.\n","Q.   Which authorities?\n","A.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.\n","Q.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian\n","authorities intervene?\n","A.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn't influence or involve\n","themselves in any such matters.\n","So as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one\n","should take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to\n","\n","\n","\n","those cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and\n","what the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.\n","Now, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places\n","where possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of\n","context and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse\n","top-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian\n","Yugoslavia as well.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has\n","become a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you\n","say that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing\n","like the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged\n","by the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn't understand me correctly,\n","Mr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,\n","but there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top\n","echelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely\n","impossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like\n","that, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is\n","impossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such\n","thing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did\n","commit crimes.  And it wasn't only individuals who committed crimes.\n","There was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.\n","And I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my\n","information, but I can't be well-versed in everything, but I can in\n","basics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It\n","\n","\n","\n","wasn't the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit\n","crimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn't the policy of the\n","leadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.\n","Now, --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn't the policy of this accused in\n","concert with other --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of\n","Mr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,\n","continuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such\n","crimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the\n","most serious form of war crimes.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There's an enormous\n","list of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,\n","and the subject here is deportation.\n","Now, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let's clarify that.  Albeit in\n","Serbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,\n","Muslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\n","70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle\n","of non-discrimination like anybody else.\n","Now, I can't clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is\n","being accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it\n","stated here -- it says:  \"Milosevic, acting alone or together with other\n","members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,\n","\n","\n","\n","committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or\n","execution of the unlawful forcible transfer...\"\n","Now, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic\n","of Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or\n","unlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful\n","movement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one\n","individual?\n","A.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with\n","anything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these\n","phenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what\n","did happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group\n","to leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that\n","desire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were\n","instances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,\n","that people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,\n","something afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind\n","what had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to\n","move out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or\n","perhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they\n","were the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and\n","in some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established\n","in some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete\n","example, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from\n","Prijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a\n","convoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --\n","\n","\n","\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I'm stopping you because you have\n","answered the question.  You are becoming a little too expansive.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think that this would be very\n","important.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, what example do you know of personally?\n","A.   I'm talking about one example when Muslims were transported\n","because they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And\n","then the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose\n","name is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is\n","called Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large\n","group of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the\n","authorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part\n","of Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army\n","of Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.\n","Then he tried to explain this in a completely different way:\n","Somebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he's\n","trying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.\n","Such people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,\n","entered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and\n","then they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed\n","although they are invariably false because --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm stopping you.  Mr. Seselj, no doubt you're a\n","man of many virtues.  Is omniscience one of them?  How do you happen to\n","know all these things?  I have to ask myself that question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","\n","\n","\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Where is your knowledge coming from?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, all my life I have\n","been learning, learning, learning, and constantly learning.  Even now in\n","prison I read eight to ten hours a day, although the conditions under\n","which I live are very poor because they want to prevent me from preparing\n","my defence case properly.  But I'm a constant learner, and I wish others\n","were too.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  It would help my appreciation of your evidence if\n","only occasionally we were told of the basis for the information that you\n","have about specific matters.\n","Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of\n","Serbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and\n","that as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon\n","what do you base this statement?\n","A.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I\n","base my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent\n","statements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.\n","Secondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.\n","They never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never\n","discriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the\n","authorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in\n","Bosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.\n","So there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic\n","whatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution\n","of Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in\n","Serbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal\n","of money.  Perhaps not all of them were happy with what they got, but this\n","involved major expenditure on the part of the state.\n","Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  But did the authorities of Serbia allow\n","discrimination over any Muslim Croat or the member of any other ethnic\n","group in Serbia during the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia?\n","A.   No.  Even if there were any incidents on ethnic grounds, the\n","authorities acted in accordance with the law and brought such matters to\n","trial.  They simply did not allow things like that to happen.\n","Q.   Please look at paragraph 42 now.  Again it says here:  \"Slobodan\n","Milosevic,\" and so on and so forth, on or about the 1st of March, 1992,\n","until 391st of December, 1995, acting alone or in concert with members of\n","the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or\n","otherwise aided and abetted the planning preparation or execution of\n","wanton destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the\n","Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations and then\" --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, too fast.  Too fast.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   So I, Mr. Seselj, according to this paragraph 42, aided and\n","abetted the planning, preparation or execution, I executed this.  It\n","wasn't that I only aided and abetted others, but I committed wanton\n","\n","\n","\n","destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the Bosnian\n","Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations, and again all these\n","municipalities are listed here where I committed wanton looting of\n","property belonging to Muslims and Croats.\n","Please tell us not only what you know about this but also on the\n","basis of what you know what you know.\n","A.   This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in\n","any way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of\n","private and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three\n","sides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything\n","under control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.\n","What happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims\n","would loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have\n","their own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar\n","way in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no\n","official authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No\n","one personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,\n","et cetera.\n","There were paramilitary formations that had looting as their\n","primary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also\n","from Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People\n","travelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize\n","their car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were\n","such cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial\n","Chamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of\n","\n","\n","\n","looting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions\n","that were rather chaotic.\n","There was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.\n","Not only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika\n","Srpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.\n","Q.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in\n","a military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto\n","civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and\n","wounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.\n","You were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please\n","explain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,\n","tell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of\n","Yugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.\n","A.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a\n","dissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict\n","in Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of\n","the duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case\n","elsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on\n","both sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less\n","casualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what\n","Judge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I\n","read.\n","I was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the\n","killing of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted\n","intentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the\n","\n","\n","\n","Muslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present\n","this in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,\n","Vasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not\n","take part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official\n","factors from Serbia, that is.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.  On the transcript it's a double\n","negative.\n","Yes, Mr. --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] There is a double negative in the\n","Serbian language and it does not change the meaning of the statement.  In\n","English it might mean something different.  I'm sorry I don't know English\n","and I cannot really adjust to this.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or\n","deny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took\n","part in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you\n","confirm that?\n","A.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.\n","Q.   All right.  Thank you.\n","A.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The\n","Muslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the\n","liberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.\n","Q.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his\n","witness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,\n","including women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only\n","logical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee\n","from war.  They're fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.\n","Very often in this war and in any other war civilians would get\n","killed by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from\n","the conflict.\n","Q.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the\n","Serbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it's supposed\n","to seem?\n","A.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray\n","this, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their\n","victims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We\n","are faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is\n","based and anti-Serb grounds.\n","Q.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings\n","happened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all\n","of that can be found here in this indictment that I've been quoting to\n","you, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to\n","give.  Ask another question.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a\n","question to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that\n","he can give an answer.  He's a politician, an intellectual, a university\n","professor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,\n","and he is in a position to give an answer to this question.\n","\n","\n","\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  And I've already ruled that he is not to answer\n","it.  So proceed.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the\n","JNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know\n","about that?  This is on transcript page 20408.\n","A.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The\n","two sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the\n","bridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric\n","power plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to\n","destroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old\n","hydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the\n","paramilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The\n","conflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can't say exactly, I\n","wasn't there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And\n","then also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.\n","Q.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units\n","committed crimes in Zvornik.\n","A.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there\n","that can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but\n","who it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are\n","ascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to\n","Karadzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.\n","In Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of\n","\n","\n","\n","people for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing\n","them, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They\n","are mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided\n","by Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,\n","Drinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you\n","heard anything about this and what do you know about it?\n","A.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my\n","knowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but\n","once the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very\n","simply, who the victims were and who the executors were.\n","Q.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the\n","cultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many\n","persons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force\n","there is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I'll just go\n","on.\n","A.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were\n","committed.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn't the JNA that\n","took part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take\n","part in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully\n","investigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims\n","are still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether\n","there was enough will to investigate this matter, and I've already\n","\n","\n","\n","referred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect\n","a great deal from that.\n","Q.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?\n","A.   No, I don't know anything about it.  I wasn't there.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj and Mr. Milosevic, you are not\n","observing the pause between question and answer, and you are thereby\n","creating difficulties for the interpreter.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, this is the first time\n","you have warned us about this today.  As you see, Mr. Seselj and I are\n","bearing this in mind.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We're practising.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment\n","in this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your\n","units.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan's men.  Do\n","you have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your\n","units were there?  You've already explained you didn't have any units of\n","yours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers\n","were there?\n","A.   I'm not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik\n","area.  I know that Arkan's Tigers were active there but to what extent and\n","in what locations I couldn't say because I wasn't there.\n","All the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I\n","do not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and\n","misfortunes he talked about, but evidently he's very confused when\n","\n","\n","\n","identifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He's mixing up Seselj's\n","men, the White Eagles, Arkan's men, and this shows that he's very confused\n","and unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers\n","of the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to\n","everything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very\n","often it's beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn't be easy to\n","establish who actually perpetrated this.\n","Q.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a\n","certain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the\n","transcript.  Do you know anything about this?\n","A.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","committed any crimes in that place.\n","Q.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb\n","Radical Party?\n","A.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party\n","sent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,\n","and as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me\n","had any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I'm sure of it.\n","Q.   Would other volunteers have reported this?\n","A.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and\n","they would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,\n","because this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about\n","the conducts of the volunteers?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn't say the reports were\n","\n","\n","\n","regular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out\n","how the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All\n","the problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of\n","indiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers\n","to be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline\n","of the other men.\n","I was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the\n","conclusion that none occurred.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral\n","conversations.\n","I'm convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written\n","reports would have been sent to me.  I'm sure that the competent command\n","would have told me had something like this happened.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, if you can't recall it doesn't matter, but is it true\n","that in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,\n","1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of\n","Seselj's men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?\n","A.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj's men, then\n","should be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell\n","you whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group\n","of Seselj's men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he's\n","the leader if they don't know his name?  What does the term \"leader\" mean?\n","\n","\n","\n","Was he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times\n","that volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in\n","units larger than a company.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I\n","have a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I\n","wanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the\n","indictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no\n","such instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","Party.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such\n","instances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various\n","allegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of\n","time.\n","Please tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about\n","the events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men\n","participated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\n","A.   First of all --\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is that reference?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I quoted about half an hour ago, but\n","it wasn't sufficiently clear.  I will try to find it again.  I'm simply\n","trying to establish whether the witness knows anything about\n","Bosanski Samac.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have some knowledge but --\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  The answer -- the question I have is --  what do\n","you mean by \"because it says,\" it says, \"that your men participated in\n","taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\"  What is \"it\"?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj something about\n","Samac before, but right now I can't find it.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  I take it it's not another reference to the\n","indictment against Mr. Seselj.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I don't think it is.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have Bosanski Samac mentioned in\n","several places on your indictment, if I can be of assistance, and I can\n","tell you what I know about the events in Bosanski Samac.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Well, that's the only reason I asked you whether you knew\n","anything.\n","A.   In paragraph 42 Bosanski Samac is ascribed to you.\n","Q.   Well, all the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are\n","ascribed to me.  There aren't any which are not ascribed to me.  But what\n","do you know about the events there?\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I don't understand this question.  You\n","can't just ask a question, take a municipality and say, \"What do you know\n","about events there?\"  There's got to be some point to the question.\n","Now, what is this dealing with?\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Very well.  I won't ask you anything about that, then, because I\n","\n","\n","\n","can't find the reference now.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, Mr. Milosevic.  If you find the\n","reference, you can come back to it, but bear in mind that you undertook to\n","complete the evidence in chief today.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I'm doing my best, Mr. Robinson, but\n","there are many, many witnesses who mentioned Mr. Seselj, and I want to see\n","whether there's any truth in anything they said.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, you may -- Mr. Milosevic, you may have\n","other witnesses who may be in a better position to contradict the\n","assertions in the Prosecution case than Mr. Seselj himself.  Don't assume\n","that because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he's the\n","best person to contradict it.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   On page 23520 of the transcript.  I'll skip over the witness's\n","name because I can't recall at present whether or not he was protected,\n","Mr. Robinson.  I don't think he was, because I don't have any note to that\n","effect, but he says:  \"In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the\n","White Wolves, and the JNA participated.\"\n","Do you know anything about this?\n","A.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,\n","there was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from\n","Eastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the\n","indictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.\n","His name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA\n","\n","\n","\n","helicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was\n","accompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","Party, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for\n","sure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also\n","Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as\n","the Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was\n","charged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in\n","Banja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical\n","Party.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and\n","the party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.\n","Q.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don't know that Kragujevac\n","is not in Bosnia.\n","A.   That's correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I'm getting ready\n","to obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was\n","expelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan\n","Savic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the\n","Serb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave\n","my legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial\n","and all the accompanying materials.\n","As for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to\n","me certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man\n","Radovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his\n","participation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.\n","Those are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members\n","of the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know\n","\n","\n","\n","had previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even\n","called him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was\n","Srecko Radovanovic.\n","There was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was\n","certainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was\n","certainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been\n","he would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that\n","unit was called the Grey Wolves.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I've understood\n","from that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions\n","in Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you've said?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,\n","yes.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called\n","the Grey Wolves active there?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it's very problematic to say\n","paramilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means\n","outside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial\n","Defence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I'm not\n","sure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,\n","I think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good\n","fighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what\n","happened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called\n","Crkvina or something like that.  I can't recall it all off the top of my\n","head, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in\n","\n","\n","\n","Banja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven't dealt with.  Did\n","they participate?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What\n","Red Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  That's a perfectly legitimate answer for you to\n","give, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the\n","Red Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the\n","quotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,\n","which on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they've got\n","nothing to do with the question.  So all I'm doing now is trying to find\n","out what the real answer to that question is.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the\n","Red Berets.\n","--- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.\n","--- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the\n","technical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary\n","resulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected\n","witness.\n","Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey\n","\n","\n","\n","Wolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also\n","mentioned.  Now, the witness, I don't know whether he was protected or\n","not, I don't want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the\n","transcript says that he saw 20 locals, and it's about Samac, wearing\n","uniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed\n","they were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned\n","to Samac.  Do you know anything about that?\n","A.   Well, I don't have any information to that effect, and that is\n","quite impossible.  I'd like to point out once again that in different\n","places they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had\n","found some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have\n","been various units, especially as we're talking about locals in this\n","particular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What\n","does it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some\n","warehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they\n","were some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the\n","Red Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of\n","the State Security in 1996.\n","So quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term\n","applies to different concepts.\n","Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I\n","think that is in the indictment against you but you'll put me right if I'm\n","wrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,\n","that is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,\n","wherein amongst others you said:  \"Dear brother Chetniks, especially you\n","\n","\n","\n","across the Drina, you're the bravest, and we're going to clear up Bosnia\n","from the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong.\"  Is\n","it true that you said that?\n","A.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and\n","partially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,\n","because -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don't always know\n","the Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an\n","artificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the\n","Croats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian\n","variation \"pogan\" means \"pagan,\" where as in the Serb language \"pogan\"\n","means \"waste\" or \"faeces.\"  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and\n","pan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called\n","them \"pogani,\" which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the\n","Muslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I'm not a stupid\n","man.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have\n","nothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more\n","than I do to all the Christians afterwards, let's make that point clear,\n","but I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --\n","greatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims\n","to be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.\n","So here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion\n","is being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,\n","and I've been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,\n","Islamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they\n","first appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.\n","\n","\n","\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.  Well, if you\n","haven't got if it in my books then the Prosecution probably has a copy\n","because most of my speeches were published in my books, in my works so, if\n","a speech does not happen to be there, if --\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Was this one published in your books?  I apologise.\n","I haven't read them all.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson [sic], two years ago I\n","handed over to The Hague Tribunal 80 of my printed works.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Is this speech in any of them?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Most probably, but it would be up to\n","the Prosecution to find it, not me.  I can't look through that whole\n","matter myself, because I didn't make the statement only in one place.  I\n","made the statement in several places, on several occasions.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Well, normally the party presenting the evidence is\n","responsible for getting it to court in some -- as official as is possible,\n","but you're not aware of a copy of it being available for us as part of the\n","papers in connection with your evidence.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Bonomy, the side that has\n","referred to my alleged speech is the Prosecution's side.  So I'm just\n","telling you where they made a mistake.  So they can find the original of\n","the speech and present it here.  I can't do the work of the Prosecution.\n","I can't be expected to do that.  I am testifying to the facts and\n","circumstances about which I have knowledge.  I'm not here to help the\n","\n","\n","\n","Prosecution out in its work.  And for my part, I have contributed\n","sufficiently by handing over all my books.  They have far greater\n","resources than I do.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Nice, can you help?  Where do I locate the\n","evidence, readily locate the evidence in relation to this?\n","MR. NICE:  I'm not sure you can locate it readily at the moment\n","from our own database.  It may be possible.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  It appears Mr. Seselj is suggesting that there is\n","evidence of this speech led by the Prosecution in this case.\n","MR. NICE:  It may be in this case or it may be in the pre-trial\n","brief of his own case.  I'll deal with it as soon as I can.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  All right.  Thank you.\n","MR. NICE:  We can't of course be guided in the way we are going to\n","present our questions through his observations.  We'll make our own\n","decisions.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  No, no, no.  That's nothing to the point.  I'm just\n","trying to clarify where I can read this speech, but if no one's going to\n","help me, that's okay.\n","MR. NICE:  We certainly will help you when we can.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Witness B1643 who testified pursuant to 92 bis, I assume you know\n","the written part, mentioned torture and capture of civilians in the SUP\n","building of the Territorial Defence in the primary school and secondary\n","school in Crkvina, the warehouse there.  Do you know anything about that?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   Well, I already mentioned something about this.  I said that the\n","Crkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey\n","Wolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was\n","arrested, but I don't have any details about how the trial proceeded and\n","the upshot.  I asked my legal advisors to find the complete dossier of\n","that trial, but I do know for certain that he was arrested and taken to\n","trial in Banja Luka, prosecuted in Banja Luka.\n","Q.   The indictment against you, in the indictment you are accused of\n","an act on the 7th of May, 1992, which allegedly happened there which says\n","that two leaders of your group under your command killed 18 males at the\n","agricultural farm in Crkvina.  Is that the event you are referring to?\n","A.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn't there\n","nor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical\n","Party.\n","Q.   That's all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your\n","answer suffices.\n","You are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when\n","allegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated\n","killed 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating\n","on the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was\n","quoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.\n","So it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this\n","question of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that\n","\n","\n","\n","concept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he\n","stands accused, because he's testifying here.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily\n","relevant for that purpose.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I'm not going to\n","insist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993\n","some members of your alleged --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have\n","continued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not\n","see at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial\n","here.  I know that he's alleged to be a member of the joint criminal\n","enterprise.  I'm well aware of that.  But that doesn't let in any and all\n","kind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see\n","here that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,\n","then that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren't true\n","either, and he has refuted a number of witnesses' statements here that I\n","quoted.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know\n","you know that.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, witness William Thomas Francis Roy on page 28882 of\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the transcript stated here that the Muslim snipers killed three pregnant\n","women and only then did the Serb snipers respond by opening fire.  Do you\n","know anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked\n","to killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?\n","A.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire\n","in Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front\n","line stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part\n","under Muslim control and another part under Serb control.\n","Now, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind\n","the following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from\n","rifles which wasn't a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because\n","sniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with\n","optic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the\n","Serb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to\n","come by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black\n","market.  I don't exclude the possibility of individual cases there being\n","the need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was\n","opened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain\n","control of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two\n","sides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn't\n","change for many years, and one or the other side would take control of\n","certain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.\n","On the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional\n","killing of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims\n","killed about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,\n","\n","\n","\n","in Kazani and so on.\n","Q.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the\n","Sarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present\n","on both sides.  Is that true?\n","A.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in\n","Sarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The\n","real snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far\n","more than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more\n","sophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more\n","favourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I've forgotten the evidence which I\n","think there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How\n","much personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the\n","conflict there.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to\n","the Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that\n","is.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.\n","At Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and\n","I met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh\n","shipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my\n","colleagues from university and also people whom I'd been to school with,\n","Muslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire\n","going on?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my\n","\n","\n","\n","stay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some\n","dangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you\n","had to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but\n","there were no more serious conflicts at that time.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,\n","referred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on\n","page 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs\n","fired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in\n","Sarajevo?\n","A.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open\n","fire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be\n","ascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused\n","protected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction\n","from the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo\n","they would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at\n","Serb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off\n","in the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,\n","then they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at\n","hospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,\n","who were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the\n","hospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw\n","quickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived\n","they didn't come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening\n","\n","\n","\n","fire in retaliation.\n","Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited\n","Bijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --\n","page 8258 of Alija Gusalic's -- 18258, and I link this up with your\n","indictment and Alija Gusalic's testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina\n","and members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to\n","takeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?\n","A.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite\n","correct.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just\n","nonsense.\n","Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there\n","were Arkan's men and Seselj's men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything\n","about that?\n","A.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb\n","Radical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I'm absolutely certain\n","of that.\n","Q.   The same witness says on page 18260, \"Seselj's men had beards and\n","cockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to\n","distribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party.\"\n","A.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb\n","Radical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly\n","clean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not\n","bring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot\n","be synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for\n","ideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was\n","\n","\n","\n","not a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier\n","having a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not\n","distribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role\n","in these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.\n","Members of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but\n","exclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.\n","Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now\n","I'm asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were\n","not Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were\n","held at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you\n","know anything about that?\n","A.   I don't know about those particular localities, but I've already\n","talked about Mauzer's and Arkan's conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for\n","that reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often\n","attacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.\n","Q.   I'm sorry that I didn't draw your attention to this on time,\n","Mr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you\n","are being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in\n","Batkovic.\n","A.   I've already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb\n","Radical Party there.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic\n","testified here, and he made those assertions here, and I'm linking that up\n","with --\n","\n","\n","\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness\n","made the allegations here.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp\n","near Bijeljina.  And I've linked that up to what the indictment against\n","Mr. Seselj says.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that's not relevant.  Move on.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused\n","Mr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a\n","hundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it's not relevant to\n","this case.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the\n","basis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks\n","about Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in\n","Mr. Seselj's indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane\n","treatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in\n","Seselj's indictment?\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the\n","International Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything\n","about this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?\n","A.   I don't know anything about the visit of the International Red\n","\n","\n","\n","Cross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.\n","Also, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of\n","prisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not\n","take part in any such thing.\n","As for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and\n","if there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would\n","have to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.\n","Q.   All right.  I'm not going to ask you about this anymore.  You\n","mentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is\n","that right?\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the\n","activity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the\n","situation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,\n","do you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?\n","A.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no\n","paramilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in\n","Mostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,\n","from the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical\n","Party were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them\n","as highly disciplined on Belgrade television.\n","If there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have\n","been members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention\n","platoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not\n","preclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this\n","\n","\n","\n","was not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.\n","Q.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp\n","there were Seselj's Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;\n","transcript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?\n","A.   That is absolutely impossible.  I've never heard of the White\n","Eagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven't heard of this Buna\n","camp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","Party, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared\n","in Buna.  I don't know anything about this, but there should be proper\n","records to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White\n","Eagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any\n","Red Berets.\n","Q.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in\n","Nevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?\n","A.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I\n","was in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and\n","in the Neretva valley.\n","Q.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?\n","A.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in\n","Nevesinje.\n","Q.   That will do.\n","A.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable\n","number of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no\n","conflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large\n","number of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they\n","\n","\n","\n","were put up at various facilities there.\n","Q.   Do you know anything about a lake, Boracko Jezero, and a rest\n","house there where about 19 persons were killed, according to the\n","allegations made?\n","A.   I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers\n","of the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That's close to\n","Konjic.  I've already said that there were members of the Serb guard\n","there.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was\n","there, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was\n","operating.\n","Q.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan's Serb\n","volunteer guard?\n","A.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.\n","Q.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?\n","A.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared\n","elsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities\n","had a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because\n","they stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then\n","they appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a\n","lot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic's.  As far as I\n","know, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj --\n","A.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav\n","Lajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.\n","Q.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   The Serb guard.\n","Q.   Of Vuk Draskovic?\n","A.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from\n","Novi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made\n","to the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.  I've forgotten\n","his first name.\n","A.   Jovan.\n","Q.   Jovan Dulovic who testified here.  Mr. Robinson instructed me to\n","find the original documents that can be linked up to your submissions\n","since they refused to admit your submissions.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I am sorry, Mr. Robinson.  If you're\n","telling me to have copies made I will do that, but I've just received\n","these copies.  This is a series of photocopies of articles written by\n","Jovan Dulovic and published in Ekspres Politika from the 16th of November,\n","the 26th of November, all of that in 1991.  Then the 18th of November, the\n","2nd of November.  So from November 1991.\n","In these articles, he speaks very favourably of the JNA and\n","commends their behaviour in the fighting around Vukovar.  For example, he\n","says that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats, saw the light of\n","the day after having stayed in cellars for many --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, what is the question?\n","MR. NICE:  And, Your Honour, if I may interrupt, if there's going\n","to be a reference to and quotation from a newspaper article, it has to be\n","on the overhead projector.  It then has to be available to us to read it\n","\n","\n","\n","in full should we wish to.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's -- that's the practice, Mr. Milosevic.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, since I have only one copy of these articles and I've\n","just received that, could the usher please place them on the ELMO, and\n","then you can have a look at least at some of the parts that have been\n","marked.  Reference is made to Major Sljivancanin here, too, in a very\n","favourable light.  Gratitude for assistance to civilians, Croats, at that,\n","and so on and so forth.  Please look at this series of articles.\n","In order to answer my question, are these at least partly articles\n","that you relied on when you wrote those submissions to the other side\n","about the untruthful testimony of Jovan Dulovic or, rather, the difference\n","in -- between his reporting then and his testimony here about Vukovar?\n","MR. NICE:  Your Honour, that was a leading but nevertheless it's\n","interesting to see what the articles actually say.  And if it becomes\n","relevant to consider their admissibility as evidence, I know the Chamber\n","will have in mind its open recent ruling in respect of the documents of\n","Jasovic and the potential evidential value or not as evidence of these\n","documents, but I'm most interested frankly in seeing what they actually\n","say.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let's get it on the overhead projector.\n","There appears to be a technical problem.  We're not seeing\n","anything.\n","Mr. Milosevic, the technician is being called.  He's coming in.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","So move on to another question.  We'll come back to this.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am sorry, but my\n","next question also has to do with something that Mr. Seselj already\n","testified about and the document that I obtained in the meantime and that\n","would also have to be placed on the ELMO.  That is --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,\n","because the overhead projector is not working.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further\n","questions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except\n","for this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a\n","decision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were\n","presented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal\n","government said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was\n","known who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.\n","The 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.  So it is about\n","40 days after the coup d'etat of the 5th of October, 2000.  It was then\n","that they were all released, set free.\n","So wanted to show you this document, and I wanted to hand out\n","copies to you.  I've just received this.  They are all in the Serbian\n","language but they can be placed on the ELMO to show what the government\n","spokesman had said was completely disregarded, and these persons mentioned\n","in the criminal report against Erdemovic were set free.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  The ELMO is working now, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, please take a look at this.  This is a series of\n","\n","\n","\n","articles from Ekspres Politika.  Can you see the date of the newspaper?\n","A.   It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of\n","November.\n","Q.   1991; right?\n","A.   1991.\n","Q.   Unless this is a leading question.\n","A.   It's illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one\n","of the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when\n","preparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.\n","That is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of\n","Evidence and Procedure.\n","Q.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the\n","subheading?\n","A.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both\n","Serbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars\n","for a long time.  \"Light finally,\" is the heading.  And then in the\n","subheading:  \"Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas.\"  And then there's\n","another bit saying, \"In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,\"\n","and then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, \"I cannot believe\n","that we are alive,\" and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated\n","the town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.\n","THE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of\n","the question was not heard by the interpreters.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.  The interpreters have\n","indicated that you're overlapping and so she did not hear the beginning of\n","\n","\n","\n","the last question.  Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","And please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.\n","Perhaps it's easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text\n","is.\n","A.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as\n","follows:  \"A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total\n","of 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity.\"\n","That's what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and\n","Croats equally.  Civilians, that is.\n","I can't read the first paragraph because it's quite illegible, but\n","it seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,\n","that several ambulances were waiting to help.  \"It would not be a good\n","thing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now.\"\n","So Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of\n","Vukovar before the fighting had stopped.\n","Q.   Can you see the subtitle which says \"The cruel major\"?\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this\n","refers to and what it says about this cruel major.\n","A.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians\n","very nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that\n","surprised this Croat woman, and he says:  \"No knows what she as a Croat\n","heard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers.\"  So he's describing the\n","\n","\n","\n","behaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what\n","Croatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very\n","bad way.\n","And then Major Sljivancanin says:  \"Whenever you need anything,\n","look for me and I'll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to\n","go, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full\n","of gratitude.\"  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  \"He had\n","followed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude.\"\n","All this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now\n","Colonel Veselin Sljivancanin.\n","Q.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic\n","describes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, \"Take this\n","child to hospital immediately.\"\n","A.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, \"Take this child to the\n","hospital in Negoslavci right away,\" Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing\n","the ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  \"Let her be given\n","assistance and medicine.\"\n","A little later Vlatka's mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for\n","her daughter in the crowd.  \"Where is my child?  What have they done to\n","her?  Where have they taken her,\" Verica was crying out.\n","\"Don't be afraid.  She is in hospital,\" Sljivancanin said.  The\n","frightened woman didn't believe it.\"  This is followed by Dulovic's\n","comment:  \"Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA\n","soldiers.\"\n","Q.   And what does it say then?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   \"Get into my car.  I'll take you to the hospital so you can see\n","your child and reassure yourself that everything is all right.  They both\n","entered the vehicle.  In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and\n","dressed Vlatka's wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the\n","daughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them.\"\n","Q.   So this is Dulovic's report from the Vukovar war theatre.\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on\n","the following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points\n","are.  This large title, this heading, that is.\n","A.   Yes.  Now it's been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a\n","statement, \"I believed in the army.\"  And what's in the subtitle.  \"A\n","little less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in\n","Vukovar.\"  And then there's a quotation.\n","A.   \"We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the\n","guards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the\n","hospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims.\"\n","Q.   And look what it says in the article.\n","A.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the\n","following:  \"In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and\n","barricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house\n","number 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,\n","Milos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.  A few days\n","later, the members of the guards burst into the cellar.  These were\n","members of the Croatian National Guard Corps.  Get out or we'll throw a\n","\n","\n","\n","bomb in.  The Chetniks are coming.  They're cutting everyone's throats.\n","We're taking you to a shelter.\"\n","Q.   It's quite illegible.  Could you put some light on it?\n","Look at the passages marked in yellow.  You don't have to read it\n","all out, just a few passages.\n","A.    \"Several of us -- or, rather, above us on the cemetery the guards\n","members were stationed.  Milka Vidovic said, 'When they visited us in the\n","cellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone's throats.  We\n","Serbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the\n","only thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.  I\n","believed in our army and I believed they would arrive.'\"\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  What's the question in relation to this,\n","Mr. Milosevic?\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, what is the signature marked in yellow here?\n","A.   Jovan Dulovic.  The same Jovan Dulovic who four or five years\n","later changed his version by -- he turned around by 180 degrees because he\n","has become a mercenary of the Western intelligence services, and he writes\n","for the magazine Vreme which is the Belgrade branch of Western\n","intelligence agencies.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, when you glanced through this article and you dealt\n","with it in your submission, is there a single word here which does not\n","speak favourably of the JNA and the people who fought in Vukovar?\n","A.   No.  The texts are all exceptionally favourable, full of praise\n","for the soldiers and officers of the JNA during the fighting for Vukovar.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   Would you look at the next page, please.  Let's just see what the\n","date is.\n","A.   The 18th, I suppose.  The 18th of November.\n","Q.   Well, move on.  Move on.\n","A.   Mr. Milosevic, Dulovic says here one day with volunteers and tank\n","crews in the street fighting for the liberation of Vukovar.  He praises\n","the volunteers who participated in the fighting for Vukovar as part of the\n","JNA.  So this should be noted.\n","Next page, please.  I think that it's very important to point this\n","out.\n","Q.   And the signature is Jovan Dulovic.  What's the title of this\n","article?\n","A.   The title of this article is \"The Knights of Vukovar.\"\n","Q.   And who does it refer to?\n","A.   The units of Major Borivoje Tesic on the front line in Vukovar.\n","Major Borivoje Tesic I think -- says: \"I think this is the last stage of\n","the fighting.  Crews carrying out their tasks successfully and the help of\n","brave people is indispensable.\"  It speaks of Croatian Ustasha and so on.\n","Q.   Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?\n","A.   Yes.\n","JUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic\n","said volunteers as part of JNA.  Could you show us the passage where\n","Mr. Dulovic said so?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He says here:  \"One day with\n","volunteers and tank crews in the street fighting for the liberation of\n","\n","\n","\n","Vukovar.\"  This is above the headline.\n","Then he goes on to say:  \"Speaking favourably of Stanko Vujanovic,\n","he says the commander of the 1st Company of the Territorial Defence of\n","Vukovar who is said to be a man who knows no fear.\" It's quite difficult\n","to read this.  My eyesight is not so good and this is not very legible.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Can it be enlarged?\n","A.   \"With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making\n","openings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze\n","through and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.  The house in\n","which they stopped in Prugomijska [phoen] Street near the Brdo cafe is\n","under constant fire by snipers whose positionings are very difficult to\n","discern.\"\n","JUDGE KWON:  Now, Mr. Seselj, I would like see to see the passage\n","which shows that they were part of JNA as you indicated.  Or was it your\n","comment?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  Please.  In the entire text the\n","volunteers are spoken of as members of the JNA.  We have passage here in\n","the third column where it says it's in the late afternoon and the fighting\n","is dying down.  The volunteers --\n","JUDGE KWON:  Could you use the pointer.  And you indicate on the\n","newspaper on the ELMO, not your monitor.  Yes.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] \"It's late in the afternoon and the\n","fighting is dying down.  The volunteers have pierced deep, and they have\n","conquered territory between the enemy forces.  The fighters will stay here\n","\n","\n","\n","until the morning.  There were no casualties today except for one soldier\n","who was killed, and his name was Vignjevic.\"\n","He then says:  \"We are going back while shells are flying over our\n","heads and Howitzer shells and so on.\"\n","This whole text implies that the volunteers why part of the JNA.\n","Mr. Kwon, you have here an order showing that these volunteers joined the\n","1st Guards Brigade.  The order was delivered to the OTP from Belgrade and\n","it's beyond dispute.\n","In the Vukovar, there were no troops outside the JNA.  There were\n","no paramilitary units.\n","JUDGE KWON:  It is your comment.  I really didn't see any\n","concrete -- the description these volunteers as part of JNA by\n","Mr. Dulovic.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have to read the whole text and\n","everything will become clear to you.\n","JUDGE KWON:  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Look at the next page, please.  The following text or this one\n","again says the Knights of Vukovar, Major Borivoje Tesic's units on the\n","front line, and this is a large article which seems not to be by Dulovic,\n","but on the left-hand side there is a small one:  \"Brave commander falls,\n","Borovo Selo.\"  Would you look at the signature?  I believe it's by\n","Dulovic.  Could you scroll up?\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   What does it say in the passage marked by yellow?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   The initials \"JD\" mean Jovan Dulovic.\n","Q.   And what does it say in this last passage?\n","A.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- \"The inhabitants of the\n","Crepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,\n","who with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village\n","and one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the\n","highest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages.\"\n","Q.   And he was killed?\n","A.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives\n","him.  Next page.\n","Q.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a\n","look?  I haven't had time to look at it all carefully.\n","A.   Yes.  There's a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of\n","November.  \"Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate\n","Vukovar.\"\n","In these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate\n","Vukovar, and five years later he's saying something completely different.\n","\"Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in\n","Vukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb.\"  And then it\n","says:  \"The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back,\" and so on\n","and so forth.\n","So this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the\n","JNA.\n","Q.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It's been circled.\n","A.   Yes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   Very well.\n","A.   The 4th of November, 1991.  \"For two days fierce fighting has not\n","stopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in\n","flames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of\n","Njusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the\n","Territorial Defence.  Advances by Territorial Defence units and volunteers\n","from the direction of Trpinja stopped on the edge of Borovo Naselje.\"\n","He then speaks of a Croatian mortar attack on Bobota [phoen] and\n","so on.\n","Q.   Is this another report by Dulovic?\n","A.   Yes, it's signed by Jovan Dulovic.\n","Q.   Is there anything else, any other report?\n","A.   I'm looking at another text here but I can't see whether it's by\n","Dulovic or not because it's not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian\n","volunteer guard but again a very favourable text.  I couldn't see -- I\n","can't see the name of the author here.  I can't see it on this page.\n","Q.   Is there anything else underneath, another report?\n","A.   \"Who are the volunteers,\" is the next title.\n","Q.   Well, I can't see anything anymore.\n","A.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced\n","through the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is \"Through the holes\n","to the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?\n","Unknown ammunition with inhumane bullets.\"\n","What happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used\n","weapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds\n","\n","\n","\n","because the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal\n","organs.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, I can't see what it says here in yellow, highlighted\n","in yellow.\n","A.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It's Major Radic now\n","who also stands accused in The Hague.  \"Throughout the month of October,\n","the fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in\n","the clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least\n","one person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja\n","[phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in\n","that way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had\n","taken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.\n","The snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own\n","control and then a solution was found to move through the houses.\"\n","Q.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic's article\n","again?\n","A.   Well, it's not legible but it is a series of articles by him.  We\n","can't find a signature here but quite obviously it is a series of articles\n","by him.\n","Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  Is that a series of articles to which you\n","referred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect\n","to Dulovic's testimony?\n","A.   Yes.  But this isn't the complete material.  My legal advisors\n","found many more texts of this kind and they quote them in extenso, and in\n","my submission I state my intention to disclose them in keeping with\n","\n","\n","\n","Rule 67 of the rules of evidence.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, I have one more question\n","[as interpreted] -- Robinson, I have a question for you.  As my associates\n","have managed to come by a set of these or at least photocopies of the\n","papers from 1991 which Mr. Seselj refers to in his submission to the other\n","side, the presentation of these photocopies, is that sufficient grounds\n","for my request that they be accepted as exhibits, that Mr. Seselj's\n","submission be accepted as an exhibit?\n","MR. NICE:  Rather interesting issues, I think, arise on the\n","validity of these documents as exhibits, and it may be necessary to go\n","back and remind ourselves of what Mr. Dulovic himself said about these\n","matters.

[Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some\n","questions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian\n","indictment, that have to do with the \"Rump Presidency\" as it's called\n","here.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  \"The Rump Presidency\n","carried out Slobodan Milosevic's policies,\" and so on and so forth, \"had\n","\n","\n","\n","effect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief.\"\n","I'm not going to ask you to repeat what you've already said, but\n","in relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of\n","Serbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they\n","not take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency\n","of the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any\n","objective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from\n","carrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?\n","The question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,\n","Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the\n","SFRY Presidency in Belgrade?\n","A.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,\n","staying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was\n","never a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from\n","carrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped\n","coming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had\n","practically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe\n","Mesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying\n","that they could not come because they could not strike a balance in\n","relation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and\n","Montenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.\n","The representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were\n","not expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was\n","actually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display\n","such feelings at the time.  It's only when he left Belgrade and when he\n","\n","\n","\n","came back to the Croatian parliament that he said, \"I've completed my\n","duty.  Yugoslavia is no more.\"\n","He pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.\n","Also, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him\n","sufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he\n","condemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most\n","cooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was\n","what he was.\n","I already said that according to the constitution of the then\n","Yugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one\n","single member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been\n","prevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could\n","have gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could\n","have refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the\n","Presidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the\n","Presidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed\n","within the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably\n","before Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a\n","Rump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of\n","a rump Presidency.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  \"Slobodan Milosevic,\n","in his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that\n","Yugoslavia was finished.\"\n","\n","\n","\n","Please, you've got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I'm not\n","going to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much\n","time.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to\n","here or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that\n","Yugoslavia was finished?\n","A.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say\n","that Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you\n","never said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I\n","remember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the\n","behaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went\n","through a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,\n","constitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,\n","but then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional\n","provision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases\n","to exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the\n","matter.\n","The leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never\n","did it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and\n","Croatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and\n","Macedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro\n","proclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting\n","of two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration\n","on your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   \"In March 1991 the collective Presidency of the SFRY reached a\n","deadlock on several issues.\"  That is paragraph 56.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... that sentence\n","which is at the beginning of the paragraph.  There's another allegation in\n","that last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no\n","longer be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask\n","Mr. Seselj whether that is so.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember\n","at that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian\n","public, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the\n","decisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that\n","Serbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation\n","when the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.\n","I would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there\n","was a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the\n","headquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long\n","debate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the\n","demand of the military to declare a state of emergency.\n","The top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the\n","behaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a\n","vote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.  As far as I can\n","remember --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  You have answered the question I asked, thanks.\n","Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   That is what is referred to here.  It says the representatives on\n","the Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,\n","the autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of\n","Kosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what\n","was so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the\n","Presidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?\n","A.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also\n","start the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven't got the document here\n","so I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were\n","actually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already\n","started putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the\n","Presidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the\n","Presidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not\n","very constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the\n","Presidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,\n","or Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.\n","I think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been\n","recalled in the meantime.\n","Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that\n","session or before that session or in relation to that session I never\n","declared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did\n","they declare that Yugoslavia was finished?\n","A.   I've already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian\n","politicians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was\n","one of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be\n","\n","\n","\n","hard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.\n","As for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in\n","Montenegro either.\n","Q.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to\n","normal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic\n","was elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented\n","Vojvodina at the time.\n","A.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the\n","Presidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started\n","working again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its\n","work.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of\n","Bosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil\n","Tupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new\n","crisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be\n","elected president of the Presidency.\n","There was a principle involved that the president of the\n","Presidency was elected from a different republican province every year but\n","nobody's election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic\n","did not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European\n","envoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to\n","elect him nevertheless.\n","Q.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?\n","A.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting\n","the preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from\n","those positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says\n","that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and\n","discussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between\n","Serbia and Croatia?\n","A.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I\n","remember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what\n","was skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching\n","agreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the\n","Bosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a\n","situation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it\n","increasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the\n","country at the time.\n","At that time, I -- as I've already said, the presidents of the\n","presidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys\n","had actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach\n","agreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia\n","increasingly so.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through\n","what medium?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully\n","being bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media\n","this kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were\n","already at that time being financed from the West by different Western\n","intelligence agencies, so that's the kind of media I'm talking about.  In\n","Belgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a\n","\n","\n","\n","federal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic\n","government, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government\n","in Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the\n","Western powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante\n","Markovic's government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible\n","agreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia\n","together under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been\n","eliminated.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at\n","one stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence\n","counsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest\n","collaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This\n","denies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of\n","Bosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted\n","into evidence and if not we will find this transcript.\n","However, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with\n","you as you were an active participant in all political events.  This\n","meeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the\n","division of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any\n","member of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning\n","of which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way\n","even indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?\n","A.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even\n","\n","\n","\n","if Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia\n","as an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as\n","a constituent nation as they had been before in the previous\n","constitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the\n","first president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it\n","was not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint\n","state.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans\n","persuaded him to call off the agreement.\n","Q.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It\n","says:  \"On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY\n","Presidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,\n","Sejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY\n","Presidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the\n","Presidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and\n","Macedonia.\"\n","On the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.  Was this\n","a kind of takeover of the function of the Presidency or were these\n","functions being carried out by the legal representatives?\n","A.   There was absolutely no takeover.  When four of the members of the\n","Presidency withdrew and some of them officially gave notice that they were\n","no longer members, like Drnovsek, for instance, while others simply\n","stopped attending the sessions.  The Presidency continued working with the\n","members who -- whom it was possible to gather together.\n","I suggest that the Chamber get hold of this piece of legislation.\n","I cannot quote it verbatim right now, but I'm absolutely sure it existed.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","And according to this piece of legislation, even if the majority of\n","members could not meet, the Presidency under certain circumstances would\n","continue working with the members who were present.\n","Let me remind you that in the spring of 1991 or in the early\n","summer, there was a vote taken to declare a imminent threat of war.\n","Q.   In paragraph 65 it says:  \"On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,\n","Slobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal\n","enterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from\n","Belgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the\n","mobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay\n","in Yugoslavia.\"\n","First of all, let's establish when I began advocating a unitary\n","Serb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And\n","secondly, was this anyone's idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,\n","and is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever\n","been a unitary state?\n","A.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as\n","Yugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally\n","and your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt\n","the new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the\n","autonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the\n","Serb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of\n","autonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an\n","option.\n","Furthermore, when the four former federal units had already been\n","\n","\n","\n","recognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the\n","Montenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be\n","promulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump\n","Yugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would\n","have been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -\n","because that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary\n","Serbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this\n","but didn't want to, and I am sorry that you didn't do that, because up to\n","the point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --\n","in Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It\n","appeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.\n","Q.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any\n","of my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who\n","were allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had\n","any kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?\n","A.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated\n","with you advocated such an idea.\n","Q.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it\n","says here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of\n","reservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the\n","reasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was\n","called for?\n","A.   I'm not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation\n","of reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to\n","mobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA\n","\n","\n","\n","to take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the\n","territorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that\n","this mobilisation didn't go well.  The response was very poor, because\n","Veljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn't want to remove the\n","communist insignia from the military uniforms.\n","The Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the\n","Presidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was\n","Prime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in\n","Slovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of\n","such an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops\n","into Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then\n","leadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as\n","I know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership\n","which had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.\n","Q.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your\n","name, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask\n","you now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of\n","April, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan's and\n","Seselj's men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you\n","know anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and\n","cart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of\n","cooperation with Arkan's volunteer guard?\n","A.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","did not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert\n","that, I'm saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no\n","\n","\n","\n","organised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as\n","much as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.\n","That's a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb\n","Radical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty\n","to Serbia.  I guarantee that.\n","The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict\n","instructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb\n","volunteer guard up to the --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm asking why was that instruction given to the\n","volunteers of the Serb Radical Party?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.\n","We didn't want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn't\n","want people's awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.\n","As I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,\n","long before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had\n","quarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was\n","in danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this\n","in the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding\n","that instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with\n","Arkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You're\n","not there with them.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can't say that not a single\n","volunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There's one\n","instance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a\n","\n","\n","\n","teacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical\n","Party.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of\n","about 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back\n","but, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of\n","Arkan's men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.\n","So, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint\n","military activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with\n","Arkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a\n","distance from Arkan.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.\n","Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on\n","transcript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia\n","took place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj's\n","White Eagles.\n","First of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and\n","secondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj's White Eagles?\n","A.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb\n","people organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have\n","already said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of\n","volunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After\n","that, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we\n","had volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never\n","had anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.\n","\n","\n","\n","There was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo\n","Selo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he\n","was killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not\n","carrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no\n","joint military activities.\n","Q.   Let's clarify this.  It doesn't say here that you cooperated.  It\n","says here:  \"With infiltration of Seselj's White Eagles.\"  So the White\n","Eagles are being ascribed to you.\n","A.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the\n","Prosecutor bringing witnesses here who don't no anything about what\n","happened on the ground.  It's simply nonsense to talk of a group called\n","Seselj's White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and\n","the Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn't know\n","what he was talking about.\n","Q.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,\n","2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that \"Seselj collected men in\n","Erdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia.\"  Is that\n","true, Mr. Seselj?\n","JUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493\n","who testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake\n","in my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that\n","particular page, and the page is 19003.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send\n","\n","\n","\n","them to Bosnia?\n","A.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in\n","Erdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,\n","nicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only\n","time.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --\n","we never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there\n","either, and I can state that quite categorically.\n","The people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the\n","war and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were\n","exclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I\n","absolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan's centre in Erdut\n","later on.  We never had anything to do with it.\n","Q.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is\n","20294, says that Arkan's and Seselj's men shot above the heads of the\n","civilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in\n","Bratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who\n","mistreated and abused the civilians?\n","A.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian\n","Radical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my\n","knowledge Arkan didn't appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in\n","Zvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in\n","Bratunac either.  And I've already said that in Bratunac there was\n","Deronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there\n","I was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have\n","very certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj's men were\n","in Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj's\n","mean there is no difference, says he.\n","A.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can't see any\n","difference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the\n","White Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at\n","all.  And that's not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some\n","judgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to\n","see in some other places Seselj's White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the\n","problem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses\n","which it manipulates.\n","Q.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on\n","several occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --\n","MR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven't been able to check this myself\n","because the accused hasn't been getting the references correct, and it's\n","quite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I'm grateful to\n","Ms. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came\n","(redacted).\n","But, really, I'm afraid we've got to have correct references for the\n","witnesses.  We can't simply just go to the page in the transcript.\n","Frequently our page numbers don't necessarily coincide here in court, and\n","without reference to the witnesses it's very difficult to pick it up\n","later.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in\n","pinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you're referring.  Now,\n","\n","\n","\n","Judge Kwon has already corrected you once, and apparently there is another\n","mistake in the reference.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, perhaps there might be a\n","mistake with the name, but there is no mistake with the quotation from the\n","transcript, and my question relates to the material facts which are being\n","mentioned here.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, we have to follow it, Mr. Milosevic.  There\n","is duty on you to be more careful.\n","Please proceed.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. Robinson.  And I'll\n","check this out to see whether indeed it is the same witness from\n","page 20352, the transcript line and page, the quotation that I mentioned\n","earlier on or, rather, 20351 is the exact number.  I'll check that out\n","during the break.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript\n","said that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of\n","March, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan's men took part as well as\n","Seselj's men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the\n","occupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on\n","the 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of\n","your volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?\n","A.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What\n","happened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between\n","the JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The\n","\n","\n","\n","Muslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.\n","However, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went\n","on for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting\n","the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was\n","there, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my\n","knowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of\n","the local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to\n","establish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the\n","ground there.\n","I know -- have reliable information that the commands and the\n","officers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan's and\n","the Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a\n","great deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very\n","rarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.\n","As far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,\n","over there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did\n","appear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the\n","call of Biljana Plavsic.  I can't prove that, but I do know that Biljana\n","Plavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly\n","meeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The\n","volunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina\n","were not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the\n","Serbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were\n","residents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the\n","conflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves\n","\n","\n","\n","and Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan's right-hand man.  And in\n","Serbia we didn't send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something\n","for me in relation to the Prosecution's case.  In the Bosnia indictment\n","the allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other\n","members of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the\n","Prosecution case unfolded, you're not saying, are you, that he acted\n","alone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with\n","other members of the joint criminal enterprise.\n","MR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven't reviewed each and every allegation\n","to check that there isn't one there that may be susceptible to individual\n","perpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he's working with others.\n","MR. NICE:  Yes.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually\n","your case.  It's not that he acted alone.\n","MR. NICE:  Subject to the point I've just made.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you've made, yes.\n","MR. NICE:  Yes.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Very well, Mr. Seselj.  You've just heard that explanation too.\n","Now, since you know the relationships very well between people at that\n","time, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and\n","Zvornik yourself.  Now, did I or any organs of power and authority have\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","anything to do with Arkan's volunteer guard?\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet.\n","MR. NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and\n","I think perhaps there's this qualification, although I don't think it is a\n","qualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this\n","accused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top\n","political level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are\n","criminal in nature.  It's the standard method of generation of\n","genocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar\n","[phoen].\n","Now, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other\n","people.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may\n","be minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in\n","those circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting\n","alone in certain circumstances, but that's the only qualification I think\n","I should make.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it's a point that will warrant some\n","consideration later on, yes.\n","Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   So Arkan is mentioned here as well as Mauzer.  Did I or anybody\n","else from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all\n","and with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?\n","A.   I'm quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.\n","On the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open\n","\n","\n","\n","contacts with Arkan.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many\n","questions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the\n","evidence he's giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,\n","how is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan\n","or Mauzer?\n","He's giving evidence.  He's saying that you had nothing to do with\n","him.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to\n","establish how he's in a position to make that statement.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that\n","cannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from\n","the authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or\n","relationship with Arkan or Mauzer?\n","A.   In Belgrade you couldn't hide anything like that.  It would be\n","impossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is\n","that kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become\n","public.\n","Second, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts\n","only with Zoran Djindjic.  And I've already spoken about the relationship\n","between Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic's vice-president and the\n","president of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his\n","pre-electoral campaign.\n","Q.   Let's clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did\n","you have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be\n","\n","\n","\n","able to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in\n","Bijeljina?\n","A.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina\n","sufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,\n","including Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this\n","trial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events\n","that went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in\n","Bijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements\n","and held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and\n","severely criticised Mauzer's conduct, especially Mauzer's conduct towards\n","the Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am\n","preparing them for my own trial, which doesn't seem to be starting.\n","Q.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack\n","on the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the\n","JNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by\n","the Red Berets or, rather, Arkan's and Seselj's men.  So that's the\n","quotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan's\n","and Seselj's men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red\n","Berets were they?  What Arkan's men were they, Seselj's men were they\n","around Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?\n","A.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the\n","witness don't seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened\n","to see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red\n","cap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.\n","And then he -- the witness doesn't know whether they were Seselj's men or\n","\n","\n","\n","Arkan's men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it's\n","highly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of\n","his head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify\n","so-called Seselj's men and Arkan's men and these alleged Red Berets.\n","As for the Red Berets, I've already given you reliable facts about\n","them and said that name appeared in different situations relating to\n","different military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina\n","area where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then\n","the army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of\n","the intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until\n","the special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of\n","Serbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this\n","misunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed\n","to people with -- which they had nothing to do with.\n","Q.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the\n","following:  \"Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia\n","who were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done.\"\n","That's when this witness claims.\n","A.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He's a colonel by\n","rank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff\n","of the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the\n","number two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that's the same\n","Osman Selak that you're referring to.\n","Q.   Well, I can't tell you that.\n","A.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of\n","\n","\n","\n","Republika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a\n","statement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,\n","what the circumstances were in which I said it.\n","I did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the\n","secession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia\n","seceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,\n","and for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he\n","personally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.\n","As far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from\n","Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of\n","Yugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and\n","Raska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of\n","examples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army\n","perform their duty very honourably.\n","So the citizens --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are\n","saying that you did make such a statement or you didn't make such a\n","statement.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if\n","you don't show me something like that here, where and when.  Let us see\n","the statement concerned.  Let me identify it.  I gave thousands and\n","thousands of statements in public.  They were publicly recorded.  They\n","were published.  So let's see.\n","My objection is precisely in that.  Why did this Osman Selak not\n","\n","\n","\n","say where and when?\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  That's helpful to some extent.  Does it follow from\n","the answer you've just given that you could have said it?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I could have said it along the\n","following lines, that those in the army who came from the renegade\n","republics in principle should not remain at positions in the Yugoslav\n","army.  You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live\n","in Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in\n","the army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as\n","officers?\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  That's simply confusing me further.  The quote was\n","that you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims\n","and Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that\n","you could possibly have made that statement in these terms?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not saying that I made that kind\n","of statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak\n","testified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise\n","lines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman\n","Selak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be\n","established.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the\n","Prosecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly\n","what I said.\n","I am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,\n","but it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you're asking me to do is\n","to comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman\n","\n","\n","\n","Selak's view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make\n","my statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm\n","trying to understand the answer you've given to the question asked by\n","Mr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you've just said, the problem is\n","that you've been studying this yourself, and you're trying to justify a\n","position of your own without really dealing specifically with the question\n","that's being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears\n","now to be that you couldn't possibly have made a statement of that nature,\n","although you might have said something much more specific about different\n","people but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.\n","Now, is that a fair summary of your position?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I'm not sure, by think you're\n","very close.  However, in order to help you, I'm going to give you an\n","example.\n","Throughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were\n","informed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,\n","escaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of\n","confidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998\n","we had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of\n","the military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his\n","family abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives\n","there.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn't remotely sound as if it's\n","going to be at all helpful to me, so we'll proceed with Mr. Milosevic's\n","\n","\n","\n","questions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you\n","was about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist\n","statement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple\n","issue I'm not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further\n","if he wishes.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in\n","no uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that\n","any statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never\n","in my life have I made a racist statement.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  There's nothing for you to respond to.\n","Mr. Milosevic, the next question.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, I'm afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I\n","put a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific\n","terms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated\n","\n","\n","\n","here that \"Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia\n","who were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed.\"  Did you ever state\n","that?\n","A.   No, I didn't say it that way.\n","Q.   So you didn't say it that way --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... matter.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  And why on earth it should take all this time to\n","establish that simple issue, I do not know.\n","Perhaps it would help, Mr. Seselj, if you just listened to the\n","questions and answer the question that's actually asked rather than try to\n","make political statements about your own position.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not making political statements,\n","Mr. Bonomy.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He\n","mentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether\n","those facts are correct.  And first of all, I'm interested in the\n","circumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  \"Just after\n","the bombing Seselj came to Pale.\"  And then on page 26762 he\n","says:  \"Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to\n","support the Bosnian Serbs.\"  These are a few facts that referred to.\n","Could you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this\n","actually all about?\n","A.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of\n","\n","\n","\n","Republika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the\n","leadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly\n","engaged in an anti-Serb policy.\n","As for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market\n","itself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the\n","street of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these\n","are explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of\n","whether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar\n","shells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.\n","This was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the\n","Serbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the\n","threats that were made, and so on and so forth.\n","Q.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there\n","you did so only to give political support to the leadership of\n","Republika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and\n","bombing.\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  \"In January or February\n","1992\" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, \"Arkan's\n","and Seselj's units arrived in Doboj.\"\n","Is this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?\n","A.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,\n","there were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.\n","Secondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to\n","Doboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan's Tigers never\n","\n","\n","\n","operated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.\n","Q.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to\n","this question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on\n","transcript page 27738, quite explicitly, \"Mirko Blagojevic,\" that is to\n","say, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he\n","says:  \"Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,\n","and he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with\n","Seselj.\"\n","I am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical\n","Party or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that\n","Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So\n","please deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the\n","transcript.  Is it correct or not?\n","A.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is\n","organised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A\n","conflict occurs when two armed formations clash.\n","Mirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in\n","Bijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim\n","formations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any\n","conflicts.  And I guarantee with my own life that he took part in no\n","looting, no persecutions, no maltreatment of the civilian population and\n","so on and so forth.  I'm absolutely certain of that.\n","Q.   Thank you.\n","A.   I can fully identify with everything that Mirko Blagojevic did.\n","It is to that degree that I'm certain that he never did anything against\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the law.\n","Q.   Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  \"Seselj's\n","men tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm.\"\n","A.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?\n","Q.   My understanding is it's somewhere near Zvornik.\n","A.   That's quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","Party took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there\n","in brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on\n","for a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the\n","Muslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to\n","an end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","withdrew.\n","I preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on\n","guarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing\n","happened, I would have had to know about it.\n","Q.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you\n","personally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following\n","circumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  \"Seselj,\n","on Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired\n","it at Muslims in Sarajevo.\"  This was shown on television, and he said\n","that you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.\n","A.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at\n","Grbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called\n","international observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go\n","around the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the\n","\n","\n","\n","Serb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was\n","an apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I\n","used a Browning machine-gun from there.  It's a heavy machine-gun.  I\n","couldn't carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry\n","it around.\n","Q.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.\n","A.   You cannot carry it.  It's too long.  It was installed in that\n","building, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches\n","below the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of\n","the volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was\n","firing from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and\n","the top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is\n","something I don't know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who\n","could have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this\n","small participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.\n","A Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that\n","case, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been\n","forced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of\n","those who in violation of international law of war brought him out there\n","to dig trenches, not those who --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,\n","that at the beginning of April Seselj's men arrived in the area of\n","Bratunac and Zvornik.\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic's part.  He knows\n","full well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing\n","who he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and\n","making this sweeping statement Seselj's men arrived in Bratunac and\n","Zvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it's as if they were in Bratunac\n","too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so\n","Deronjic invented that.\n","In Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the\n","Bratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was\n","commander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he\n","was not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,\n","then a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.  I think the interpreter is having\n","some difficulty.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will.\n","You could have noticed, Mr. Robinson, that I have been trying as\n","of late to speak slowly, but sometimes, every now and then, I may forget\n","what you cautioned me about.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, I had noticed, and the -- we are\n","appreciative of the effort you are making.  You have answered the\n","question.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the meantime --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  I think you have answered that question.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   So they were not in Bratunac at all?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in\n","Bratunac.\n","Q.   All right.  So you are saying that he's not telling the truth.\n","The same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not\n","agree that Seselj was a true opposition.\n","A.   The Hague OTP and Judge Schomburg on several occasions caught\n","Deronjic lying.  And even in Deronjic's judgement you can find about seven\n","different points as ascertained by Judge Schomburg, namely that Deronjic\n","was lying.\n","Secondly, in the case of people who are inclined to a pro-Western\n","policy or are mercenaries of Western intelligence agencies, or in order to\n","save their own skin they go into plea bargaining with the OTP and\n","therefore appear as witnesses in the trials of other people, it can often\n","be heard that those who are really opposition but are not prepared to\n","serve the West --\n","MR. NICE:  I'm not sure this is responsive to any question --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Are you interrupting me?\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet, Mr. Seselj, and he's\n","entitled to make an objection if he wishes.\n","MR. NICE:  He was simply asked if the man was telling the truth.\n","We have his answer and he's now gone on to a long comment basically.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, you have moved into the area of comment.\n","It's now time for the break.\n","Mr. Nice, I should say the question that I asked earlier related\n","to the Bosnia indictment.\n","\n","\n","\n","We will break for 20 minutes.\n","--- Recess taken at 3.41 p.m.\n","--- On resuming at 4.08 p.m.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, you told me to check\n","the pages that Mr. Nice mentioned, 35 -- 20352 and 20351, that is.  This\n","was Witness 1070.\n","On page 20351 he says that Seselj's men were in Bratunac and that\n","there was no difference between them and Seselj's men, the White Eagles,\n","that is.\n","And on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April\n","Seselj's and Arkan's men were in Bratunac together when some people were\n","deported.  And Mr. Seselj answered questions about this.  In the meantime,\n","the liaison officer had the transcript, and I have received a note saying\n","that both references are correct, both as regards page 20351 and 20352,\n","and these refer to Witness 1070.  There was no error.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  All right, Mr. Milosevic.  We'll do our own\n","check.  Thank you for checking anyhow.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, this is the testimony of Miroslav Deronjic, who said\n","that you were not truly an opposition politician or, rather, that you\n","cooperated with the government and that therefore this idea of a joint\n","criminal enterprise is thereby confirmed.  Were you in the opposition or\n","not?\n","THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.\n","\n","\n","\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it\n","on.\n","Both the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time\n","were distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as\n","it's possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by\n","Deronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the\n","opposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint\n","often expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various\n","government and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person\n","of the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or\n","Miles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery\n","and so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while\n","criticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition\n","politicians, and this logic is completely upside down.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Witness Ahmet Zulic says, and that's on page 30000 of the\n","transcript, he says that Seselj's men were stationed in the partisan\n","cemetery in Pobrezje, that doesn't matter so much but what matters is the\n","following, that they had come there to kill the Muslims.\n","A.   Where is this place?  Pobrezje?  Where is it?\n","Q.   I have a note here in Pobrezje.  I can't be more specific than\n","that.\n","But let me put a question to you:  Did your volunteers go anywhere\n","to kill all Muslims?\n","A.   No.  Nowhere did the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party go to\n","\n","\n","\n","kill Muslims or Croats or any kind of civilians.  Wherever they went, they\n","were part of the JNA, and they went there to fight against the\n","paramilitary units that wanted to break up Yugoslavia.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, it's important to know the\n","location.  I'm not sure whether Mr. Nice or Mr. Kay can help.  Your note\n","doesn't identify clearly the name of this place?\n","MR. NICE:  I tried to make an electronic search but for various\n","reasons it doesn't work at the moment or doesn't work for this witness on\n","this particular part of his evidence.  I'll try again.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","JUDGE KWON:  You said Pobrezje.\n","Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   The same witness, Ahmet Zulic, on page 30047, says in Sanski Most\n","there was no fighting, but the civilians fled because Seselj's men were\n","there.\n","Your men caused fear among civilians, although there was no\n","fighting there, as he says, in Sanski Most.\n","A.   That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,\n","throughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did\n","not fight in any location.\n","This reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a\n","certain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying\n","that sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.\n","Somebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is\n","\n","\n","\n","arriving, and he spread panic.\n","THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that the Serbian word for\n","sugar resembles Mr. Seselj's name.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere\n","in that area.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  \"From the\n","1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan\n","Milosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint\n","criminal,\" and so on,\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise\n","aided and abetted,\" and so on and so forth, all these phrases, \"the\n","planning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories\n","of Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,\n","Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.\"\n","Tell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in\n","this joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged\n","crimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made\n","here?\n","A.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from\n","Serbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia\n","and Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted\n","to proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the\n","will of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the\n","West who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or\n","execution or extermination.  There was no plan.\n","\n","\n","\n","When the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in\n","many places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only\n","where the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats\n","were in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,\n","not a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the\n","majority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They\n","had already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.\n","Q.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we\n","have already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the\n","other places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,\n","Sanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in\n","any kind of military activities?\n","A.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in\n","January, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but\n","the UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,\n","although they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was\n","established, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be\n","\n","disarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.\n","The Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian\n","villages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there\n","were two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active\n","in the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces\n","in the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the\n","only activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica\n","area.  It was in the beginning of 1993.\n","\n","\n","\n","As for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,\n","I don't know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up\n","only in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all\n","over Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army\n","of the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska\n","Krajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his\n","volunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars\n","there, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed\n","and what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy\n","that we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in\n","whole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and\n","Herzegovina?\n","A.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and\n","there was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen\n","happened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on\n","their own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit\n","murders or anything of the kind.\n","Q.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war\n","in Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the\n","other participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by\n","Mr. Nice.\n","Look at paragraph 33.  We've just been discussing paragraph 32.  I\n","won't read the beginning of paragraph 33 because it's the same:  \"From on\n","or about the 1st of March, 1992,\" and so on and so forth, and then it\n","\n","\n","\n","says:  \"On the territory of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa,\n","Bosanski Novi, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Sarajevo (Ilijas), Kljuc,\n","Kalinovik, Kotor Varos, Nevesinje, Sarajevo, Novi Grad, Sarajevo, Novo\n","Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Rudo, Sanski Most, Srebrenica\n","again, Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\"  Please --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  You are finished reading that list.  Let me\n","remind you, Mr. Milosevic, that the Rule 98 bis decision found that there\n","was not enough evidence to support the allegation in paragraph 32 in\n","relation to some of the villages or municipalities mentioned.  In fact, as\n","far as paragraph 32 is concerned, you need only concern yourself with\n","Brcko, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Bijeljina, Kotor Varos, Kljuc,\n","Bosanski Novi.  And I am checking to see whether the decision affected\n","paragraph 33.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, could you please let\n","me know what evidence, as you say there was no evidence for these places,\n","but what was the evidence that Mr. Nice presented here about the other\n","places linking me --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.  Mr. Milosevic, the Rule 98 bis\n","decision was published and was available to you.  But I bring that to your\n","attention so we don't waste time.  And I'll ask the legal officer to give\n","me the information in relation to paragraph 33.\n","Go ahead, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   As I was saying, Mr. Seselj, I read out a list here.  It's a long\n","paragraph with all the names of the towns where I, together with others,\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","am charged with working for the extermination of Muslims and Croats.  You\n","know the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that\n","referred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded\n","in any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?\n","A.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted\n","to, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A\n","civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally\n","wanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a\n","constituent people.\n","And the question arises from there where are the Serbs from\n","Mostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from\n","Travnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from\n","many other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats\n","during that civil war?\n","After the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the\n","population, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did\n","take place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,\n","in figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I\n","can put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes\n","crimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,\n","sometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,\n","criminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and\n","revenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes\n","did not exist.  That did not happen.\n","Q.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the\n","\n","\n","\n","joint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I'd like\n","to draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of\n","December, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33\n","and indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns\n","are repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns\n","too.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.\n","So what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during\n","that period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of\n","December 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring\n","Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n","A.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia\n","or, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of\n","Yugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It\n","did not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help\n","materially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs\n","living over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different\n","political relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership\n","of Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in\n","which those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep\n","conflicts, and they didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues.\n","So throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the\n","indictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,\n","the leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered\n","in looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far\n","accepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists\n","\n","\n","\n","attacked ourselves for our part.\n","So I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy\n","dating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact\n","that that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all\n","costs.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no\n","alternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at\n","the price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept\n","because they were not able to take such great concessions.\n","Q.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities\n","of that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these\n","towns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I\n","personally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,\n","et cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason\n","explanation?\n","A.   Yes, I do, and that's explanation is the following and the fact\n","that through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,\n","and --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not\n","an explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.\n","So please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,\n","Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac\n","again, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in\n","Sarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,\n","\n","\n","\n","Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with\n","regard to that point of the indictment?\n","A.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised\n","crime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don't know whether in all the\n","places enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took\n","place in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each\n","individual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the\n","motives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are\n","still living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can\n","be established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side\n","and the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to\n","investigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to\n","strike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the\n","number of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.\n","Q.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you've said when you said\n","that some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let's look at\n","that for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of\n","Yugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or\n","formations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes\n","that you know of?  Are there any links?\n","A.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of\n","power and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as\n","well, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,\n","the Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the\n","Academy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,\n","\n","\n","\n","everybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out\n","against them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for\n","freedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were\n","being perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes\n","should be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind\n","via the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political\n","parties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which\n","strove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors\n","spoke out against crimes.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Now, we -- let's look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful\n","confinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,\n","Bosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the\n","territories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,\n","Samac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,\n","Kotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,\n","Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\n","Tell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these\n","people in these towns did we take part in?\n","A.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have\n","had anything to do with any such thing.\n","First of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What\n","the confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of\n","civilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is\n","\n","\n","\n","unlawful, and there were such cases.\n","Now, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of\n","all, there were individual instances in some of these places through the\n","self-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance\n","of Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.\n","And then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of\n","their own because they couldn't influence him.  He appeared as a factor,\n","and there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his\n","motives were of a criminal nature.\n","There were other such cases in some of these places whereby\n","somebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in\n","order to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive\n","money and then release them once they received money for that.  There were\n","also instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,\n","somebody's family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or\n","Croats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often\n","were not able to prevent revenge of that kind.\n","Q.   Which authorities?\n","A.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.\n","Q.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian\n","authorities intervene?\n","A.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn't influence or involve\n","themselves in any such matters.\n","So as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one\n","should take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to\n","\n","\n","\n","those cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and\n","what the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.\n","Now, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places\n","where possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of\n","context and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse\n","top-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian\n","Yugoslavia as well.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has\n","become a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you\n","say that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing\n","like the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged\n","by the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn't understand me correctly,\n","Mr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,\n","but there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top\n","echelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely\n","impossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like\n","that, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is\n","impossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such\n","thing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did\n","commit crimes.  And it wasn't only individuals who committed crimes.\n","There was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.\n","And I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my\n","information, but I can't be well-versed in everything, but I can in\n","basics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It\n","\n","\n","\n","wasn't the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit\n","crimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn't the policy of the\n","leadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.\n","Now, --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn't the policy of this accused in\n","concert with other --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of\n","Mr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,\n","continuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such\n","crimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the\n","most serious form of war crimes.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There's an enormous\n","list of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,\n","and the subject here is deportation.\n","Now, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let's clarify that.  Albeit in\n","Serbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,\n","Muslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\n","70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle\n","of non-discrimination like anybody else.\n","Now, I can't clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is\n","being accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it\n","stated here -- it says:  \"Milosevic, acting alone or together with other\n","members of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,\n","\n","\n","\n","committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or\n","execution of the unlawful forcible transfer...\"\n","Now, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic\n","of Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or\n","unlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful\n","movement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one\n","individual?\n","A.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with\n","anything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these\n","phenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what\n","did happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group\n","to leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that\n","desire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were\n","instances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,\n","that people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,\n","something afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind\n","what had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to\n","move out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or\n","perhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they\n","were the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and\n","in some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established\n","in some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete\n","example, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from\n","Prijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a\n","convoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --\n","\n","\n","\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I'm stopping you because you have\n","answered the question.  You are becoming a little too expansive.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think that this would be very\n","important.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, what example do you know of personally?\n","A.   I'm talking about one example when Muslims were transported\n","because they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And\n","then the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose\n","name is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is\n","called Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large\n","group of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the\n","authorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part\n","of Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army\n","of Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.\n","Then he tried to explain this in a completely different way:\n","Somebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he's\n","trying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.\n","Such people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,\n","entered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and\n","then they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed\n","although they are invariably false because --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  I'm stopping you.  Mr. Seselj, no doubt you're a\n","man of many virtues.  Is omniscience one of them?  How do you happen to\n","know all these things?  I have to ask myself that question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","\n","\n","\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Where is your knowledge coming from?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, all my life I have\n","been learning, learning, learning, and constantly learning.  Even now in\n","prison I read eight to ten hours a day, although the conditions under\n","which I live are very poor because they want to prevent me from preparing\n","my defence case properly.  But I'm a constant learner, and I wish others\n","were too.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  It would help my appreciation of your evidence if\n","only occasionally we were told of the basis for the information that you\n","have about specific matters.\n","Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of\n","Serbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and\n","that as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon\n","what do you base this statement?\n","A.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I\n","base my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent\n","statements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.\n","Secondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.\n","They never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never\n","discriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the\n","authorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in\n","Bosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.\n","So there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic\n","whatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution\n","of Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in\n","Serbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal\n","of money.  Perhaps not all of them were happy with what they got, but this\n","involved major expenditure on the part of the state.\n","Q.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  But did the authorities of Serbia allow\n","discrimination over any Muslim Croat or the member of any other ethnic\n","group in Serbia during the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia?\n","A.   No.  Even if there were any incidents on ethnic grounds, the\n","authorities acted in accordance with the law and brought such matters to\n","trial.  They simply did not allow things like that to happen.\n","Q.   Please look at paragraph 42 now.  Again it says here:  \"Slobodan\n","Milosevic,\" and so on and so forth, on or about the 1st of March, 1992,\n","until 391st of December, 1995, acting alone or in concert with members of\n","the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or\n","otherwise aided and abetted the planning preparation or execution of\n","wanton destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the\n","Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations and then\" --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, too fast.  Too fast.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   So I, Mr. Seselj, according to this paragraph 42, aided and\n","abetted the planning, preparation or execution, I executed this.  It\n","wasn't that I only aided and abetted others, but I committed wanton\n","\n","\n","\n","destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the Bosnian\n","Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations, and again all these\n","municipalities are listed here where I committed wanton looting of\n","property belonging to Muslims and Croats.\n","Please tell us not only what you know about this but also on the\n","basis of what you know what you know.\n","A.   This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in\n","any way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of\n","private and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three\n","sides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything\n","under control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.\n","What happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims\n","would loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have\n","their own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar\n","way in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no\n","official authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No\n","one personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,\n","et cetera.\n","There were paramilitary formations that had looting as their\n","primary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also\n","from Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People\n","travelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize\n","their car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were\n","such cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial\n","Chamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of\n","\n","\n","\n","looting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions\n","that were rather chaotic.\n","There was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.\n","Not only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika\n","Srpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.\n","Q.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in\n","a military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto\n","civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and\n","wounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.\n","You were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please\n","explain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,\n","tell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of\n","Yugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.\n","A.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a\n","dissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict\n","in Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of\n","the duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case\n","elsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on\n","both sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less\n","casualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what\n","Judge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I\n","read.\n","I was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the\n","killing of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted\n","intentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the\n","\n","\n","\n","Muslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present\n","this in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,\n","Vasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not\n","take part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official\n","factors from Serbia, that is.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.  On the transcript it's a double\n","negative.\n","Yes, Mr. --\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] There is a double negative in the\n","Serbian language and it does not change the meaning of the statement.  In\n","English it might mean something different.  I'm sorry I don't know English\n","and I cannot really adjust to this.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or\n","deny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took\n","part in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you\n","confirm that?\n","A.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.\n","Q.   All right.  Thank you.\n","A.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The\n","Muslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the\n","liberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.\n","Q.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his\n","witness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,\n","including women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only\n","logical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee\n","from war.  They're fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.\n","Very often in this war and in any other war civilians would get\n","killed by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from\n","the conflict.\n","Q.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the\n","Serbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it's supposed\n","to seem?\n","A.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray\n","this, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their\n","victims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We\n","are faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is\n","based and anti-Serb grounds.\n","Q.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings\n","happened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all\n","of that can be found here in this indictment that I've been quoting to\n","you, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to\n","give.  Ask another question.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a\n","question to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that\n","he can give an answer.  He's a politician, an intellectual, a university\n","professor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,\n","and he is in a position to give an answer to this question.\n","\n","\n","\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  And I've already ruled that he is not to answer\n","it.  So proceed.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the\n","JNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know\n","about that?  This is on transcript page 20408.\n","A.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The\n","two sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the\n","bridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric\n","power plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to\n","destroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old\n","hydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the\n","paramilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The\n","conflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can't say exactly, I\n","wasn't there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And\n","then also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.\n","Q.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units\n","committed crimes in Zvornik.\n","A.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there\n","that can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but\n","who it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are\n","ascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to\n","Karadzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.\n","In Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of\n","\n","\n","\n","people for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing\n","them, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They\n","are mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided\n","by Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,\n","Drinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you\n","heard anything about this and what do you know about it?\n","A.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my\n","knowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but\n","once the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very\n","simply, who the victims were and who the executors were.\n","Q.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the\n","cultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many\n","persons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force\n","there is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I'll just go\n","on.\n","A.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were\n","committed.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn't the JNA that\n","took part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take\n","part in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully\n","investigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims\n","are still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether\n","there was enough will to investigate this matter, and I've already\n","\n","\n","\n","referred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect\n","a great deal from that.\n","Q.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?\n","A.   No, I don't know anything about it.  I wasn't there.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj and Mr. Milosevic, you are not\n","observing the pause between question and answer, and you are thereby\n","creating difficulties for the interpreter.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, this is the first time\n","you have warned us about this today.  As you see, Mr. Seselj and I are\n","bearing this in mind.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We're practising.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment\n","in this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your\n","units.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan's men.  Do\n","you have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your\n","units were there?  You've already explained you didn't have any units of\n","yours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers\n","were there?\n","A.   I'm not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik\n","area.  I know that Arkan's Tigers were active there but to what extent and\n","in what locations I couldn't say because I wasn't there.\n","All the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I\n","do not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and\n","misfortunes he talked about, but evidently he's very confused when\n","\n","\n","\n","identifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He's mixing up Seselj's\n","men, the White Eagles, Arkan's men, and this shows that he's very confused\n","and unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers\n","of the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to\n","everything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very\n","often it's beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn't be easy to\n","establish who actually perpetrated this.\n","Q.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a\n","certain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the\n","transcript.  Do you know anything about this?\n","A.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\n","committed any crimes in that place.\n","Q.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb\n","Radical Party?\n","A.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party\n","sent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,\n","and as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me\n","had any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I'm sure of it.\n","Q.   Would other volunteers have reported this?\n","A.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and\n","they would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,\n","because this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about\n","the conducts of the volunteers?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn't say the reports were\n","\n","\n","\n","regular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out\n","how the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All\n","the problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of\n","indiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers\n","to be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline\n","of the other men.\n","I was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the\n","conclusion that none occurred.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral\n","conversations.\n","I'm convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written\n","reports would have been sent to me.  I'm sure that the competent command\n","would have told me had something like this happened.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, if you can't recall it doesn't matter, but is it true\n","that in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,\n","1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of\n","Seselj's men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?\n","A.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj's men, then\n","should be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell\n","you whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group\n","of Seselj's men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he's\n","the leader if they don't know his name?  What does the term \"leader\" mean?\n","\n","\n","\n","Was he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times\n","that volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in\n","units larger than a company.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I\n","have a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I\n","wanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the\n","indictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no\n","such instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","Party.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such\n","instances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various\n","allegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of\n","time.\n","Please tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about\n","the events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men\n","participated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\n","A.   First of all --\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is that reference?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I quoted about half an hour ago, but\n","it wasn't sufficiently clear.  I will try to find it again.

MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Well, that's the only reason I asked you whether you knew\n","anything.\n","A.   In paragraph 42 Bosanski Samac is ascribed to you.\n","Q.   Well, all the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are\n","ascribed to me.  There aren't any which are not ascribed to me.  But what\n","do you know about the events there?\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I don't understand this question.  You\n","can't just ask a question, take a municipality and say, \"What do you know\n","about events there?\"  There's got to be some point to the question.\n","Now, what is this dealing with?\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Very well.  I won't ask you anything about that, then, because I\n","\n","\n","\n","can't find the reference now.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, Mr. Milosevic.  If you find the\n","reference, you can come back to it, but bear in mind that you undertook to\n","complete the evidence in chief today.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I'm doing my best, Mr. Robinson, but\n","there are many, many witnesses who mentioned Mr. Seselj, and I want to see\n","whether there's any truth in anything they said.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, you may -- Mr. Milosevic, you may have\n","other witnesses who may be in a better position to contradict the\n","assertions in the Prosecution case than Mr. Seselj himself.  Don't assume\n","that because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he's the\n","best person to contradict it.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   On page 23520 of the transcript.  I'll skip over the witness's\n","name because I can't recall at present whether or not he was protected,\n","Mr. Robinson.  I don't think he was, because I don't have any note to that\n","effect, but he says:  \"In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the\n","White Wolves, and the JNA participated.\"\n","Do you know anything about this?\n","A.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,\n","there was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from\n","Eastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the\n","indictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.\n","His name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA\n","\n","\n","\n","helicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was\n","accompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","Party, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for\n","sure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also\n","Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as\n","the Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was\n","charged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in\n","Banja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical\n","Party.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and\n","the party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.\n","Q.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don't know that Kragujevac\n","is not in Bosnia.\n","A.   That's correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I'm getting ready\n","to obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was\n","expelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan\n","Savic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the\n","Serb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave\n","my legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial\n","and all the accompanying materials.\n","As for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to\n","me certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man\n","Radovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his\n","participation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.\n","Those are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members\n","of the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know\n","\n","\n","\n","had previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even\n","called him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was\n","Srecko Radovanovic.\n","There was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was\n","certainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was\n","certainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been\n","he would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that\n","unit was called the Grey Wolves.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I've understood\n","from that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions\n","in Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you've said?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,\n","yes.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called\n","the Grey Wolves active there?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it's very problematic to say\n","paramilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means\n","outside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial\n","Defence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I'm not\n","sure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,\n","I think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good\n","fighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what\n","happened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called\n","Crkvina or something like that.  I can't recall it all off the top of my\n","head, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in\n","\n","\n","\n","Banja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven't dealt with.  Did\n","they participate?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What\n","Red Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  That's a perfectly legitimate answer for you to\n","give, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the\n","Red Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the\n","quotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,\n","which on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they've got\n","nothing to do with the question.  So all I'm doing now is trying to find\n","out what the real answer to that question is.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the\n","Red Berets.\n","--- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.\n","--- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the\n","technical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary\n","resulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected\n","witness.\n","Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey\n","\n","\n","\n","Wolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also\n","mentioned.  Now, the witness, I don't know whether he was protected or\n","not, I don't want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the\n","transcript says that he saw 20 locals, and it's about Samac, wearing\n","uniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed\n","they were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned\n","to Samac.  Do you know anything about that?\n","A.   Well, I don't have any information to that effect, and that is\n","quite impossible.  I'd like to point out once again that in different\n","places they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had\n","found some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have\n","been various units, especially as we're talking about locals in this\n","particular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What\n","does it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some\n","warehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they\n","were some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the\n","Red Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of\n","the State Security in 1996.\n","So quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term\n","applies to different concepts.\n","Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I\n","think that is in the indictment against you but you'll put me right if I'm\n","wrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,\n","that is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,\n","wherein amongst others you said:  \"Dear brother Chetniks, especially you\n","\n","\n","\n","across the Drina, you're the bravest, and we're going to clear up Bosnia\n","from the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong.\"  Is\n","it true that you said that?\n","A.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and\n","partially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,\n","because -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don't always know\n","the Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an\n","artificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the\n","Croats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian\n","variation \"pogan\" means \"pagan,\" where as in the Serb language \"pogan\"\n","means \"waste\" or \"faeces.\"  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and\n","pan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called\n","them \"pogani,\" which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the\n","Muslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I'm not a stupid\n","man.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have\n","nothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more\n","than I do to all the Christians afterwards, let's make that point clear,\n","but I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --\n","greatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims\n","to be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.\n","So here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion\n","is being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,\n","and I've been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,\n","Islamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they\n","first appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.\n","\n","\n","\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.  Well, if you\n","haven't got if it in my books then the Prosecution probably has a copy\n","because most of my speeches were published in my books, in my works so, if\n","a speech does not happen to be there, if --\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Was this one published in your books?  I apologise.\n","I haven't read them all.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson [sic], two years ago I\n","handed over to The Hague Tribunal 80 of my printed works.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Is this speech in any of them?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Most probably, but it would be up to\n","the Prosecution to find it, not me.  I can't look through that whole\n","matter myself, because I didn't make the statement only in one place.  I\n","made the statement in several places, on several occasions.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Well, normally the party presenting the evidence is\n","responsible for getting it to court in some -- as official as is possible,\n","but you're not aware of a copy of it being available for us as part of the\n","papers in connection with your evidence.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Bonomy, the side that has\n","referred to my alleged speech is the Prosecution's side.  So I'm just\n","telling you where they made a mistake.  So they can find the original of\n","the speech and present it here.  I can't do the work of the Prosecution.\n","I can't be expected to do that.  I am testifying to the facts and\n","circumstances about which I have knowledge.  I'm not here to help the\n","\n","\n","\n","Prosecution out in its work.  And for my part, I have contributed\n","sufficiently by handing over all my books.  They have far greater\n","resources than I do.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Nice, can you help?  Where do I locate the\n","evidence, readily locate the evidence in relation to this?\n","MR. NICE:  I'm not sure you can locate it readily at the moment\n","from our own database.  It may be possible.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  It appears Mr. Seselj is suggesting that there is\n","evidence of this speech led by the Prosecution in this case.\n","MR. NICE:  It may be in this case or it may be in the pre-trial\n","brief of his own case.  I'll deal with it as soon as I can.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  All right.  Thank you.\n","MR. NICE:  We can't of course be guided in the way we are going to\n","present our questions through his observations.  We'll make our own\n","decisions.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  No, no, no.  That's nothing to the point.  I'm just\n","trying to clarify where I can read this speech, but if no one's going to\n","help me, that's okay.\n","MR. NICE:  We certainly will help you when we can.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Witness B1643 who testified pursuant to 92 bis, I assume you know\n","the written part, mentioned torture and capture of civilians in the SUP\n","building of the Territorial Defence in the primary school and secondary\n","school in Crkvina, the warehouse there.  Do you know anything about that?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   Well, I already mentioned something about this.  I said that the\n","Crkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey\n","Wolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was\n","arrested, but I don't have any details about how the trial proceeded and\n","the upshot.  I asked my legal advisors to find the complete dossier of\n","that trial, but I do know for certain that he was arrested and taken to\n","trial in Banja Luka, prosecuted in Banja Luka.\n","Q.   The indictment against you, in the indictment you are accused of\n","an act on the 7th of May, 1992, which allegedly happened there which says\n","that two leaders of your group under your command killed 18 males at the\n","agricultural farm in Crkvina.  Is that the event you are referring to?\n","A.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn't there\n","nor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical\n","Party.\n","Q.   That's all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your\n","answer suffices.\n","You are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when\n","allegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated\n","killed 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating\n","on the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was\n","quoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.\n","So it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this\n","question of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that\n","\n","\n","\n","concept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he\n","stands accused, because he's testifying here.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily\n","relevant for that purpose.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I'm not going to\n","insist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993\n","some members of your alleged --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have\n","continued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not\n","see at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial\n","here.  I know that he's alleged to be a member of the joint criminal\n","enterprise.  I'm well aware of that.  But that doesn't let in any and all\n","kind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see\n","here that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,\n","then that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren't true\n","either, and he has refuted a number of witnesses' statements here that I\n","quoted.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know\n","you know that.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, witness William Thomas Francis Roy on page 28882 of\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the transcript stated here that the Muslim snipers killed three pregnant\n","women and only then did the Serb snipers respond by opening fire.  Do you\n","know anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked\n","to killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?\n","A.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire\n","in Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front\n","line stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part\n","under Muslim control and another part under Serb control.\n","Now, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind\n","the following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from\n","rifles which wasn't a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because\n","sniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with\n","optic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the\n","Serb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to\n","come by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black\n","market.  I don't exclude the possibility of individual cases there being\n","the need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was\n","opened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain\n","control of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two\n","sides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn't\n","change for many years, and one or the other side would take control of\n","certain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.\n","On the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional\n","killing of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims\n","killed about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,\n","\n","\n","\n","in Kazani and so on.\n","Q.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the\n","Sarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present\n","on both sides.  Is that true?\n","A.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in\n","Sarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The\n","real snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far\n","more than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more\n","sophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more\n","favourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  I'm sorry, I've forgotten the evidence which I\n","think there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How\n","much personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the\n","conflict there.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to\n","the Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that\n","is.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.\n","At Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and\n","I met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh\n","shipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my\n","colleagues from university and also people whom I'd been to school with,\n","Muslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire\n","going on?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my\n","\n","\n","\n","stay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some\n","dangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you\n","had to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but\n","there were no more serious conflicts at that time.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,\n","referred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on\n","page 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs\n","fired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in\n","Sarajevo?\n","A.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open\n","fire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be\n","ascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused\n","protected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction\n","from the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo\n","they would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at\n","Serb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off\n","in the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,\n","then they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at\n","hospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,\n","who were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the\n","hospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw\n","quickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived\n","they didn't come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening\n","\n","\n","\n","fire in retaliation.\n","Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited\n","Bijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --\n","page 8258 of Alija Gusalic's -- 18258, and I link this up with your\n","indictment and Alija Gusalic's testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina\n","and members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to\n","takeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?\n","A.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite\n","correct.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just\n","nonsense.\n","Q.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there\n","were Arkan's men and Seselj's men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything\n","about that?\n","A.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb\n","Radical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I'm absolutely certain\n","of that.\n","Q.   The same witness says on page 18260, \"Seselj's men had beards and\n","cockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to\n","distribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party.\"\n","A.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb\n","Radical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly\n","clean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not\n","bring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot\n","be synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for\n","ideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was\n","\n","\n","\n","not a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier\n","having a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not\n","distribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role\n","in these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.\n","Members of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but\n","exclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.\n","Q.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now\n","I'm asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were\n","not Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were\n","held at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you\n","know anything about that?\n","A.   I don't know about those particular localities, but I've already\n","talked about Mauzer's and Arkan's conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for\n","that reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often\n","attacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.\n","Q.   I'm sorry that I didn't draw your attention to this on time,\n","Mr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you\n","are being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in\n","Batkovic.\n","A.   I've already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb\n","Radical Party there.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic\n","testified here, and he made those assertions here, and I'm linking that up\n","with --\n","\n","\n","\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness\n","made the allegations here.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp\n","near Bijeljina.  And I've linked that up to what the indictment against\n","Mr. Seselj says.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that's not relevant.  Move on.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused\n","Mr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a\n","hundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.\n","JUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it's not relevant to\n","this case.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the\n","basis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks\n","about Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in\n","Mr. Seselj's indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane\n","treatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in\n","Seselj's indictment?\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the\n","International Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything\n","about this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?\n","A.   I don't know anything about the visit of the International Red\n","\n","\n","\n","Cross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.\n","Also, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of\n","prisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not\n","take part in any such thing.\n","As for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and\n","if there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would\n","have to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.\n","Q.   All right.  I'm not going to ask you about this anymore.  You\n","mentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is\n","that right?\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the\n","activity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the\n","situation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,\n","do you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?\n","A.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no\n","paramilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in\n","Mostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,\n","from the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical\n","Party were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them\n","as highly disciplined on Belgrade television.\n","If there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have\n","been members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention\n","platoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not\n","preclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this\n","\n","\n","\n","was not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.\n","Q.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp\n","there were Seselj's Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;\n","transcript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?\n","A.   That is absolutely impossible.  I've never heard of the White\n","Eagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven't heard of this Buna\n","camp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical\n","Party, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared\n","in Buna.  I don't know anything about this, but there should be proper\n","records to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White\n","Eagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any\n","Red Berets.\n","Q.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in\n","Nevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?\n","A.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I\n","was in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and\n","in the Neretva valley.\n","Q.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?\n","A.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in\n","Nevesinje.\n","Q.   That will do.\n","A.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable\n","number of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no\n","conflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large\n","number of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they\n","\n","\n","\n","were put up at various facilities there.\n","Q.   Do you know anything about a lake, Boracko Jezero, and a rest\n","house there where about 19 persons were killed, according to the\n","allegations made?\n","A.   I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers\n","of the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That's close to\n","Konjic.  I've already said that there were members of the Serb guard\n","there.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was\n","there, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was\n","operating.\n","Q.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan's Serb\n","volunteer guard?\n","A.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.\n","Q.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?\n","A.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared\n","elsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities\n","had a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because\n","they stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then\n","they appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a\n","lot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic's.  As far as I\n","know, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj --\n","A.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav\n","Lajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.\n","Q.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   The Serb guard.\n","Q.   Of Vuk Draskovic?\n","A.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from\n","Novi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made\n","to the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.  I've forgotten\n","his first name.\n","A.   Jovan.\n","Q.   Jovan Dulovic who testified here.  Mr. Robinson instructed me to\n","find the original documents that can be linked up to your submissions\n","since they refused to admit your submissions.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I am sorry, Mr. Robinson.  If you're\n","telling me to have copies made I will do that, but I've just received\n","these copies.  This is a series of photocopies of articles written by\n","Jovan Dulovic and published in Ekspres Politika from the 16th of November,\n","the 26th of November, all of that in 1991.  Then the 18th of November, the\n","2nd of November.  So from November 1991.\n","In these articles, he speaks very favourably of the JNA and\n","commends their behaviour in the fighting around Vukovar.  For example, he\n","says that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats, saw the light of\n","the day after having stayed in cellars for many --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, what is the question?\n","MR. NICE:  And, Your Honour, if I may interrupt, if there's going\n","to be a reference to and quotation from a newspaper article, it has to be\n","on the overhead projector.  It then has to be available to us to read it\n","\n","\n","\n","in full should we wish to.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  That's -- that's the practice, Mr. Milosevic.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, since I have only one copy of these articles and I've\n","just received that, could the usher please place them on the ELMO, and\n","then you can have a look at least at some of the parts that have been\n","marked.  Reference is made to Major Sljivancanin here, too, in a very\n","favourable light.  Gratitude for assistance to civilians, Croats, at that,\n","and so on and so forth.  Please look at this series of articles.\n","In order to answer my question, are these at least partly articles\n","that you relied on when you wrote those submissions to the other side\n","about the untruthful testimony of Jovan Dulovic or, rather, the difference\n","in -- between his reporting then and his testimony here about Vukovar?\n","MR. NICE:  Your Honour, that was a leading but nevertheless it's\n","interesting to see what the articles actually say.  And if it becomes\n","relevant to consider their admissibility as evidence, I know the Chamber\n","will have in mind its open recent ruling in respect of the documents of\n","Jasovic and the potential evidential value or not as evidence of these\n","documents, but I'm most interested frankly in seeing what they actually\n","say.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let's get it on the overhead projector.\n","There appears to be a technical problem.  We're not seeing\n","anything.\n","Mr. Milosevic, the technician is being called.  He's coming in.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","So move on to another question.  We'll come back to this.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am sorry, but my\n","next question also has to do with something that Mr. Seselj already\n","testified about and the document that I obtained in the meantime and that\n","would also have to be placed on the ELMO.  That is --\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,\n","because the overhead projector is not working.\n","THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further\n","questions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except\n","for this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a\n","decision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were\n","presented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal\n","government said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was\n","known who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.\n","The 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.  So it is about\n","40 days after the coup d'etat of the 5th of October, 2000.  It was then\n","that they were all released, set free.\n","So wanted to show you this document, and I wanted to hand out\n","copies to you.  I've just received this.  They are all in the Serbian\n","language but they can be placed on the ELMO to show what the government\n","spokesman had said was completely disregarded, and these persons mentioned\n","in the criminal report against Erdemovic were set free.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  The ELMO is working now, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, please take a look at this.  This is a series of\n","\n","\n","\n","articles from Ekspres Politika.  Can you see the date of the newspaper?\n","A.   It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of\n","November.\n","Q.   1991; right?\n","A.   1991.\n","Q.   Unless this is a leading question.\n","A.   It's illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one\n","of the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when\n","preparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.\n","That is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of\n","Evidence and Procedure.\n","Q.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the\n","subheading?\n","A.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both\n","Serbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars\n","for a long time.  \"Light finally,\" is the heading.  And then in the\n","subheading:  \"Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas.\"  And then there's\n","another bit saying, \"In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,\"\n","and then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, \"I cannot believe\n","that we are alive,\" and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated\n","the town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.\n","THE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of\n","the question was not heard by the interpreters.\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.  The interpreters have\n","indicated that you're overlapping and so she did not hear the beginning of\n","\n","\n","\n","the last question.  Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.\n","And please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.\n","Perhaps it's easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text\n","is.\n","A.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as\n","follows:  \"A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total\n","of 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity.\"\n","That's what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and\n","Croats equally.  Civilians, that is.\n","I can't read the first paragraph because it's quite illegible, but\n","it seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,\n","that several ambulances were waiting to help.  \"It would not be a good\n","thing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now.\"\n","So Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of\n","Vukovar before the fighting had stopped.\n","Q.   Can you see the subtitle which says \"The cruel major\"?\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this\n","refers to and what it says about this cruel major.\n","A.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians\n","very nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that\n","surprised this Croat woman, and he says:  \"No knows what she as a Croat\n","heard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers.\"  So he's describing the\n","\n","\n","\n","behaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what\n","Croatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very\n","bad way.\n","And then Major Sljivancanin says:  \"Whenever you need anything,\n","look for me and I'll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to\n","go, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full\n","of gratitude.\"  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  \"He had\n","followed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude.\"\n","All this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now\n","Colonel Veselin Sljivancanin.\n","Q.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic\n","describes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, \"Take this\n","child to hospital immediately.\"\n","A.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, \"Take this child to the\n","hospital in Negoslavci right away,\" Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing\n","the ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  \"Let her be given\n","assistance and medicine.\"\n","A little later Vlatka's mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for\n","her daughter in the crowd.  \"Where is my child?  What have they done to\n","her?  Where have they taken her,\" Verica was crying out.\n","\"Don't be afraid.  She is in hospital,\" Sljivancanin said.  The\n","frightened woman didn't believe it.\"  This is followed by Dulovic's\n","comment:  \"Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA\n","soldiers.\"\n","Q.   And what does it say then?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   \"Get into my car.  I'll take you to the hospital so you can see\n","your child and reassure yourself that everything is all right.  They both\n","entered the vehicle.  In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and\n","dressed Vlatka's wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the\n","daughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them.\"\n","Q.   So this is Dulovic's report from the Vukovar war theatre.\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on\n","the following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points\n","are.  This large title, this heading, that is.\n","A.   Yes.  Now it's been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a\n","statement, \"I believed in the army.\"  And what's in the subtitle.  \"A\n","little less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in\n","Vukovar.\"  And then there's a quotation.\n","A.   \"We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the\n","guards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the\n","hospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims.\"\n","Q.   And look what it says in the article.\n","A.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the\n","following:  \"In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and\n","barricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house\n","number 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,\n","Milos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.  A few days\n","later, the members of the guards burst into the cellar.  These were\n","members of the Croatian National Guard Corps.  Get out or we'll throw a\n","\n","\n","\n","bomb in.  The Chetniks are coming.  They're cutting everyone's throats.\n","We're taking you to a shelter.\"\n","Q.   It's quite illegible.  Could you put some light on it?\n","Look at the passages marked in yellow.  You don't have to read it\n","all out, just a few passages.\n","A.    \"Several of us -- or, rather, above us on the cemetery the guards\n","members were stationed.  Milka Vidovic said, 'When they visited us in the\n","cellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone's throats.  We\n","Serbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the\n","only thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.  I\n","believed in our army and I believed they would arrive.'\"\n","JUDGE ROBINSON:  What's the question in relation to this,\n","Mr. Milosevic?\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, what is the signature marked in yellow here?\n","A.   Jovan Dulovic.  The same Jovan Dulovic who four or five years\n","later changed his version by -- he turned around by 180 degrees because he\n","has become a mercenary of the Western intelligence services, and he writes\n","for the magazine Vreme which is the Belgrade branch of Western\n","intelligence agencies.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, when you glanced through this article and you dealt\n","with it in your submission, is there a single word here which does not\n","speak favourably of the JNA and the people who fought in Vukovar?\n","A.   No.  The texts are all exceptionally favourable, full of praise\n","for the soldiers and officers of the JNA during the fighting for Vukovar.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   Would you look at the next page, please.  Let's just see what the\n","date is.\n","A.   The 18th, I suppose.  The 18th of November.\n","Q.   Well, move on.  Move on.\n","A.   Mr. Milosevic, Dulovic says here one day with volunteers and tank\n","crews in the street fighting for the liberation of Vukovar.  He praises\n","the volunteers who participated in the fighting for Vukovar as part of the\n","JNA.  So this should be noted.\n","Next page, please.  I think that it's very important to point this\n","out.\n","Q.   And the signature is Jovan Dulovic.  What's the title of this\n","article?\n","A.   The title of this article is \"The Knights of Vukovar.\"\n","Q.   And who does it refer to?\n","A.   The units of Major Borivoje Tesic on the front line in Vukovar.\n","Major Borivoje Tesic I think -- says: \"I think this is the last stage of\n","the fighting.  Crews carrying out their tasks successfully and the help of\n","brave people is indispensable.\"  It speaks of Croatian Ustasha and so on.\n","Q.   Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?\n","A.   Yes.\n","JUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic\n","said volunteers as part of JNA.  Could you show us the passage where\n","Mr. Dulovic said so?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He says here:  \"One day with\n","volunteers and tank crews in the street fighting for the liberation of\n","\n","\n","\n","Vukovar.\"  This is above the headline.\n","Then he goes on to say:  \"Speaking favourably of Stanko Vujanovic,\n","he says the commander of the 1st Company of the Territorial Defence of\n","Vukovar who is said to be a man who knows no fear.\" It's quite difficult\n","to read this.  My eyesight is not so good and this is not very legible.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Can it be enlarged?\n","A.   \"With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making\n","openings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze\n","through and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.  The house in\n","which they stopped in Prugomijska [phoen] Street near the Brdo cafe is\n","under constant fire by snipers whose positionings are very difficult to\n","discern.\"\n","JUDGE KWON:  Now, Mr. Seselj, I would like see to see the passage\n","which shows that they were part of JNA as you indicated.  Or was it your\n","comment?\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  Please.  In the entire text the\n","volunteers are spoken of as members of the JNA.  We have passage here in\n","the third column where it says it's in the late afternoon and the fighting\n","is dying down.  The volunteers --\n","JUDGE KWON:  Could you use the pointer.  And you indicate on the\n","newspaper on the ELMO, not your monitor.  Yes.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] \"It's late in the afternoon and the\n","fighting is dying down.

There were\n","no paramilitary units.\n","JUDGE KWON:  It is your comment.  I really didn't see any\n","concrete -- the description these volunteers as part of JNA by\n","Mr. Dulovic.\n","THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have to read the whole text and\n","everything will become clear to you.\n","JUDGE KWON:  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\n","MR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\n","Q.   Look at the next page, please.  The following text or this one\n","again says the Knights of Vukovar, Major Borivoje Tesic's units on the\n","front line, and this is a large article which seems not to be by Dulovic,\n","but on the left-hand side there is a small one:  \"Brave commander falls,\n","Borovo Selo.\"  Would you look at the signature?  I believe it's by\n","Dulovic.  Could you scroll up?\n","A.   Yes.\n","Q.   What does it say in the passage marked by yellow?\n","\n","\n","\n","A.   The initials \"JD\" mean Jovan Dulovic.\n","Q.   And what does it say in this last passage?\n","A.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- \"The inhabitants of the\n","Crepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,\n","who with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village\n","and one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the\n","highest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages.\"\n","Q.   And he was killed?\n","A.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives\n","him.  Next page.\n","Q.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a\n","look?  I haven't had time to look at it all carefully.\n","A.   Yes.  There's a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of\n","November.  \"Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate\n","Vukovar.\"\n","In these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate\n","Vukovar, and five years later he's saying something completely different.\n","\"Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in\n","Vukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb.\"  And then it\n","says:  \"The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back,\" and so on\n","and so forth.\n","So this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the\n","JNA.\n","Q.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It's been circled.\n","A.   Yes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q.   Very well.\n","A.   The 4th of November, 1991.  \"For two days fierce fighting has not\n","stopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in\n","flames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of\n","Njusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the\n","Territorial Defence.

Is this another report by Dulovic?\n","A.   Yes, it's signed by Jovan Dulovic.\n","Q.   Is there anything else, any other report?\n","A.   I'm looking at another text here but I can't see whether it's by\n","Dulovic or not because it's not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian\n","volunteer guard but again a very favourable text.

Is there anything else underneath, another report?\n","A.   \"Who are the volunteers,\" is the next title.\n","Q.   Well, I can't see anything anymore.\n","A.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced\n","through the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is \"Through the holes\n","to the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?\n","Unknown ammunition with inhumane bullets.\"\n","What happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used\n","weapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds\n","\n","\n","\n","because the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal\n","organs.\n","Q.   Mr. Seselj, I can't see what it says here in yellow, highlighted\n","in yellow.\n","A.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It's Major Radic now\n","who also stands accused in The Hague.  \"Throughout the month of October,\n","the fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in\n","the clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least\n","one person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja\n","[phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in\n","that way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had\n","taken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.\n","The snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own\n","control and then a solution was found to move through the houses.\"\n","Q.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic's article\n","again?\n","A.   Well, it's not legible but it is a series of articles by him.

Is that a series of articles to which you\n","referred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect\n","to Dulovic's testimony?\n","A.   Yes.

[Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, at the end of the last day I put some\\nquestions to you that had to do with paragraph 28 of the Bosnian\\nindictment, that have to do with the \"Rump Presidency\" as it\\'s called\\nhere.  You have partly answered that.  It says:  \"The Rump Presidency\\ncarried out Slobodan Milosevic\\'s policies,\" and so on and so forth, \"had\\n\\n\\n\\neffect and control over the JNA as its Commander-in-Chief.\"\\nI\\'m not going to ask you to repeat what you\\'ve already said, but\\nin relation to that please answer my question.  The representatives of\\nSerbia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, why did they\\nnot take part for a certain period of time in the work of the Presidency\\nof the SFRY, and were there any obstacles in Belgrade?  Did they have any\\nobjective reasons that threatened them in any way and prevented them from\\ncarrying out their functions, or were there some other reasons for this?\\nThe question is:  Why did the representatives of Slovenia,\\nCroatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia not take part in the work of the\\nSFRY Presidency in Belgrade?\\nA.   In Belgrade there were no problems in terms of them coming,\\nstaying properly, and carrying out their political duties.  There was\\nnever a single incident involved.  No one ever prevented them from\\ncarrying out their work.  However, first it was Janez Drnovsek who stopped\\ncoming to the sessions, and in this way he showed that Slovenia had\\npractically already seceded.  Then he was similarly followed by Stipe\\nMesic, Bogic Bogicevic and Vasil Tupurkovski.  At first they were saying\\nthat they could not come because they could not strike a balance in\\nrelation to the representatives of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, and\\nMontenegro, because they would always be outvoted four to three.\\nThe representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia were\\nnot expressing the -- any separatist views at that point in time that was\\nactually showed by their leaderships, and even Stipe Mesic did not display\\nsuch feelings at the time.  It\\'s only when he left Belgrade and when he\\n\\n\\n\\ncame back to the Croatian parliament that he said, \"I\\'ve completed my\\nduty.  Yugoslavia is no more.\"\\nHe pretended to be a Yugoslav for a very long period of time.\\nAlso, as a person who wanted to engage in dialogue.  He presented him\\nsufficient as such to the representatives of the European Community and he\\ncondemned the Serbs of being uncooperative.  He pretended to be the most\\ncooperative of all.  However, at the very end the mask fell and he was\\nwhat he was.\\nI already said that according to the constitution of the then\\nYugoslavia it was not possible to have a Rump Presidency.  Had only one\\nsingle member of the Presidency been in Belgrade and had all others been\\nprevented from coming, somebody could have gotten killed, somebody could\\nhave gotten sick, somebody could have been taken prisoner, somebody could\\nhave refused to come to attend a session, a single member of the\\nPresidency was sufficient to pass legal decision because we represent the\\nPresidency.  That is the kind of general legal document that existed\\nwithin the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and it was adopted considerably\\nbefore Yugoslavia disintegrated.  That is why I insist on the fact that a\\nRump Presidency is impossible.  It is inconceivable to have the notion of\\na rump Presidency.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Next question, please.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   In paragraph 56 it says, inter alia, that:  \"Slobodan Milosevic,\\nin his capacity as president of the Republic of Serbia, declared that\\nYugoslavia was finished.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease, you\\'ve got that paragraph number 56 before you.  I\\'m not\\ngoing to read the whole paragraph out because that would take up too much\\ntime.  Either after that session of the Presidency that is referred to\\nhere or before that or after that, did I in any way declare that\\nYugoslavia was finished?\\nA.   I personally think that not even today you are prepared to say\\nthat Yugoslavia is finished.  But while you held these high offices you\\nnever said any such thing.  You expressed your dissatisfaction though.  I\\nremember that speech of yours that you made in 1991 concerning the\\nbehaviour of the members of the Presidency of the SFRY.  When Serbia went\\nthrough a referendum in 1990 and adopted its new constitution or, rather,\\nconstitutional amendments that had to do with its federal competencies,\\nbut then they were immediately suspended by a particular constitutional\\nprovision saying that it will only enter into force if Yugoslavia ceases\\nto exist.  I cannot quote it verbatim, but that was the gist of the\\nmatter.\\nThe leadership of Serbia never acted against Yugoslavia and never\\ndid it contribute to the disappearance of Yugoslavia.  When Slovenia and\\nCroatia seceded, when the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and\\nMacedonia was recognised, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro\\nproclaimed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a federation consisting\\nof two federal units.  So even then there was this very marked aspiration\\non your part to keep some kind of Yugoslavia alive.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\n\\n\\n\\nQ.   \"In March 1991 the collective Presidency of the SFRY reached a\\ndeadlock on several issues.\"  That is paragraph 56.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... that sentence\\nwhich is at the beginning of the paragraph.  There\\'s another allegation in\\nthat last sentence which is that you declared that Yugoslavia would no\\nlonger be bound by decisions of the Federal Presidency, so I want to ask\\nMr. Seselj whether that is so.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  No.  As far as I can remember\\nat that time, and this speech, which is generally known in the Serbian\\npublic, Mr. Milosevic did not say that Serbia would not be bound by the\\ndecisions of the Federal Presidency.  His statement was to the effect that\\nSerbia would think about what it would do in the future in that situation\\nwhen the Federal Presidency was behaving rather irresponsibly.\\nI would like to remind you that in that same month, March, there\\nwas a meeting of the Federal Presidency in the building of the\\nheadquarters of the General Staff of the JNA.  There was a very long\\ndebate that went on; I think a day and a night.  It had to do with the\\ndemand of the military to declare a state of emergency.\\nThe top echelons of the military was quite dissatisfied with the\\nbehaviour of some members of the Presidency, and when there was finally a\\nvote not a single position prevailed.  It was a draw.  As far as I can\\nremember --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  You have answered the question I asked, thanks.\\nMr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\n\\n\\n\\nQ.   That is what is referred to here.  It says the representatives on\\nthe Presidency from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro,\\nthe autonomous province of Vojvodina, and the autonomous province of\\nKosovo and Metohija all resigned from their posts in March 1991.  So what\\nwas so controversial about this proposal that was presented to the\\nPresidency and who was it that submitted this proposal?\\nA.   The essence of this proposal was that the Presidency should also\\nstart the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  I haven\\'t got the document here\\nso I cannot quote from it.  But some members of the Presidency were\\nactually instigated by emissaries from Western Europe and they already\\nstarted putting forth such demands.  Actually, they wanted to bring the\\nPresidency into the position of declaring the end of Yugoslavia, for the\\nPresidency to declare the end of Yugoslavia.  Since the atmosphere was not\\nvery constructive, as far as I can remember three members of the\\nPresidency resigned:  Borisav Jovic from Serbia; then Nenad Bucin, was it,\\nor Branko Kostic from Montenegro; and the representative from Vojvodina.\\nI think the representative from Kosovo was Riza Sapundziju and he had been\\nrecalled in the meantime.\\nQ.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  A few moments ago you said after that\\nsession or before that session or in relation to that session I never\\ndeclared that Yugoslavia was finish.  What about other politicians?  Did\\nthey declare that Yugoslavia was finished?\\nA.   I\\'ve already said about Stipe Mesic.  And then all Slovenian\\npoliticians were saying that Yugoslavia was finished and their policy was\\none of unison, that is to say of the Slovenian leadership, and it would be\\n\\n\\n\\nhard to find anyone who was not speak along those lines.\\nAs for the Serbian leadership, no such thing ever happened; in\\nMontenegro either.\\nQ.   After these reactions, was the work of the Presidency returned to\\nnormal, because Borisav Jovic withdrew his resignation and Branko Kostic\\nwas elected on behalf of Montenegro, and Jugoslav Kostic represented\\nVojvodina at the time.\\nA.   Well, it could not be put that way, that the normal work of the\\nPresidency continued.  The Presidency was reconstituted.  It started\\nworking again, but Stipe Mesic was putting obstacles in the way of its\\nwork.  Drnovsek never came back, I think, and the representative of\\nBosnia, Bogic Bogicevic, and the representative of Macedonia, Vasil\\nTupurkovski, started behaving worse and worse.  There would be a new\\ncrisis soon after that in the month of May, when Stipe Mesic failed to be\\nelected president of the Presidency.\\nThere was a principle involved that the president of the\\nPresidency was elected from a different republican province every year but\\nnobody\\'s election was guaranteed.  There had to be a vote.  Stipe Mesic\\ndid not enjoy the confidence of the Presidency, and then Western European\\nenvoys came and exerted great pressure on the members of the Presidency to\\nelect him nevertheless.\\nQ.   What was my attitude towards Yugoslavia?\\nA.   Your attitude was always a consistent one in terms of supporting\\nthe preservation of Yugoslavia as a modern federation.  You acted from\\nthose positions.  I think that there is not a single exception to that.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ.   Do you recall what is referred to in paragraph 57 where it says\\nthat Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman met in Karadjordjevo and\\ndiscussed on March 25, 1991 the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina between\\nSerbia and Croatia?\\nA.   Yes, I remember that.  I was not present at that meeting, but I\\nremember what the official press release was.  And I also know that what\\nwas skilfully being bandied about was that you and Tudjman were reaching\\nagreement on the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina primarily to upset the\\nBosnian politicians, Alija Izetbegovic and others, and also to create a\\nsituation that would be as unpleasant as possible, that would make it\\nincreasingly difficult to find a way out of the problems that beset the\\ncountry at the time.\\nAt that time, I -- as I\\'ve already said, the presidents of the\\npresidencies of the different federal units had changed.  European envoys\\nhad actually mediated in that effort too.  It was very hard to reach\\nagreement because Slovenia had already opted for secession and Croatia\\nincreasingly so.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Who was bandying this about and what -- through\\nwhat medium?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, these rumours were skilfully\\nbeing bandied about.  I could not say exactly by who, but in several media\\nthis kind of idea appeared, and as a rule these were media that were\\nalready at that time being financed from the West by different Western\\nintelligence agencies, so that\\'s the kind of media I\\'m talking about.  In\\nBelgrade, for example, it was the Borba Daily.  Borba before that was a\\n\\n\\n\\nfederal communist newspaper.  During the time of the Ante Markovic\\ngovernment, it did not only have an opposition view towards the government\\nin Serbia but it openly advocated a Western policy, the policy of the\\nWestern powers.  It is possible that quite a bit of this came from Ante\\nMarkovic\\'s government because Ante Markovic was afraid of a possible\\nagreement between Milosevic and Tudjman, which would keep Yugoslavia\\ntogether under certain conditions, but Ante Markovic would have been\\neliminated.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   I wish to draw your attention, Mr. Robinson, to the fact that at\\none stage we had the transcript here from a secret meeting of the Defence\\ncounsel of Croatia presided over by Tudjman.  He was meeting his closest\\ncollaborators and commenting on this story about Karadjordjevo.  This\\ndenies the idea that what we discussed was some sort of division of\\nBosnia.  I will, however, check whether this has already been admitted\\ninto evidence and if not we will find this transcript.\\nHowever, what matters here, Mr. Seselj, is something to do with\\nyou as you were an active participant in all political events.  This\\nmeeting took place on the 25th of March, and allegedly we discussed the\\ndivision of Bosnia.  Did I or any other politician from Serbia or any\\nmember of the leadership of the time in all of that year, at the beginning\\nof which this meeting between Tudjman and me took place, did we in any way\\neven indirectly raise the issue of a division of Bosnia?\\nA.   No.  On the contrary.  You tried to convince Izetbegovic that even\\n\\n\\n\\nif Slovenia and Croatia seceded Bosnia should remain in a Rump Yugoslavia\\nas an equal federal unit, that the Bosnian Muslims would be recognised as\\na constituent nation as they had been before in the previous\\nconstitutional theory and practice, and that Izetbegovic would be the\\nfirst president of such a Rump Yugoslavia, in order to demonstrate that it\\nwas not the aim of the Serbs to dominate but simply to preserve the joint\\nstate.  At one point Izetbegovic agreed to this, but then the Americans\\npersuaded him to call off the agreement.\\nQ.   Look at paragraph 63 now.  It repeats this allegation.  It\\nsays:  \"On the 3rd of October, 1991, the four members of the SFRY\\nPresidency from Serbia and Montenegro, Borisav Jovic, Jugoslav Kostic,\\nSejdo Bajramovic, and Branko Kostic, assume the function of the SFRY\\nPresidency, circumventing the controls and responsibilities of the\\nPresidency members from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and\\nMacedonia.\"\\nOn the 3rd of October, 1991, they assumed the function.  Was this\\na kind of takeover of the function of the Presidency or were these\\nfunctions being carried out by the legal representatives?\\nA.   There was absolutely no takeover.  When four of the members of the\\nPresidency withdrew and some of them officially gave notice that they were\\nno longer members, like Drnovsek, for instance, while others simply\\nstopped attending the sessions.  The Presidency continued working with the\\nmembers who -- whom it was possible to gather together.\\nI suggest that the Chamber get hold of this piece of legislation.\\nI cannot quote it verbatim right now, but I\\'m absolutely sure it existed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd according to this piece of legislation, even if the majority of\\nmembers could not meet, the Presidency under certain circumstances would\\ncontinue working with the members who were present.\\nLet me remind you that in the spring of 1991 or in the early\\nsummer, there was a vote taken to declare a imminent threat of war.\\nQ.   In paragraph 65 it says:  \"On or around the 22nd of October, 1991,\\nSlobodan Milosevic, together with other members of the joint criminal\\nenterprise, continued to advocate for a unitary Serb state governed from\\nBelgrade, Serbia.  On the same date, the Rump Presidency called for the\\nmobilisation of reservists in Serbia and other regions that want to stay\\nin Yugoslavia.\"\\nFirst of all, let\\'s establish when I began advocating a unitary\\nSerb state, because it says here that I continued to advocate it.  And\\nsecondly, was this anyone\\'s idea that there should be a unitary Serbia,\\nand is a unitary Serbia the same thing as Yugoslavia, and has Serbia ever\\nbeen a unitary state?\\nA.   No.  You never advocated any kind of unitary state either as\\nYugoslavia or as Serbia.  We Serb nationalists criticised you personally\\nand your government in 1990 at the time the referendum was held to adopt\\nthe new non-communist democratic constitution of Serbia because the\\nautonomous provinces were not abolished in that constitution.  We, the\\nSerb nationalists, felt there was no longer any need for the existence of\\nautonomous provinces.  I was one of the loudest advocates of such an\\noption.\\nFurthermore, when the four former federal units had already been\\n\\n\\n\\nrecognised, and this ended on the 6th of April, 1992, you agreed with the\\nMontenegrin leadership that a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be\\npromulgated and that Yugoslavia be preserved even if it was a Rump\\nYugoslavia and that it should remain a federation.  In my view, it would\\nhave been possible for you to convince the Montenegrin leadership -\\nbecause that was the mood of the Montenegrin people - to accept a unitary\\nSerbian state to dispense with the federation.  You could have done this\\nbut didn\\'t want to, and I am sorry that you didn\\'t do that, because up to\\nthe point when you left your position of power in the former Yugoslavia --\\nin Yugoslavia, none of the leaders advocated a separatist option.  It\\nappeared in Montenegro only after the 5th of October, 2000.\\nQ.   Did you hear at that time or any other time either from me or any\\nof my close collaborators, any government officials, including those who\\nwere allegedly together with me in a joint criminal enterprise that we had\\nany kind of plan to create a unitary Serbian state?\\nA.   No.  No state official who belonged to your party or collaborated\\nwith you advocated such an idea.\\nQ.   What do you know about the mobilisation of reservists?  Because it\\nsays here that the Federal Presidency called for the mobilisation of\\nreservists.  So what do you know about this?  What do you know about the\\nreasons, the time, and the conditions under which this mobilisation was\\ncalled for?\\nA.   I\\'m not sure that the Federal Presidency called for a mobilisation\\nof reservists at all, because it is the JNA organs who are competent to\\nmobilise reservists.  It was the Federal Presidency that ordered the JNA\\n\\n\\n\\nto take necessary measures to preserve the constitutional order, the\\nterritorial integrity, and the sovereignty of the country.  I know that\\nthis mobilisation didn\\'t go well.  The response was very poor, because\\nVeljko Kadijevic, as minister of defence, didn\\'t want to remove the\\ncommunist insignia from the military uniforms.\\nThe Presidency, primarily the federal government but also the\\nPresidency, at the insistence of Stipe Mesic and Ante Markovic, who was\\nPrime Minister, issued a decision on the intervention of the JNA in\\nSlovenia.  As far as I know, the leadership of Serbia was not in favour of\\nsuch an intervention.  It was not in favour of sending additional troops\\ninto Slovenia, nor was it in favour of the JNA clashing with the then\\nleadership of Slovenia in spite of their separatist tendencies.  As far as\\nI know, Serbia wanted negotiations.  However, the Slovenian leadership\\nwhich had been encouraged by the West no longer wanted to talk.\\nQ.   Thank you.  Witness B071 mentioned on more than one occasion your\\nname, so just as I asked you about a whole number of witnesses, I will ask\\nyou now to briefly tell me whether what he said was true.  B071, on 1st of\\nApril, 2003, on page 18347 of the transcript said that Arkan\\'s and\\nSeselj\\'s men looted property and took everything off to Serbia.  Do you\\nknow anything about this?  First of all, did your people loot property and\\ncart it off to Serbia; and secondly, did your men have any kind of\\ncooperation with Arkan\\'s volunteer guard?\\nA.   No and no.  First of all, the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\\ndid not loot property anywhere or take it off to Serbia.  When I assert\\nthat, I\\'m saying that there was no organised looting anywhere and no\\n\\n\\n\\norganised taking off of war booty.  Perhaps certain individuals stole as\\nmuch as they could stuff into their pockets or into their shirt-front.\\nThat\\'s a different matter.  But as far as the volunteers of the Serb\\nRadical Party go, there was no organised looting or carting off war booty\\nto Serbia.  I guarantee that.\\nThe volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were under strict\\ninstructions to avoid any contacts or encounters with Arkan and his Serb\\nvolunteer guard up to the --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  I\\'m asking why was that instruction given to the\\nvolunteers of the Serb Radical Party?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We were afraid of being compromised.\\nWe didn\\'t want to lose our honour, our good name, our dignity.  We didn\\'t\\nwant people\\'s awareness of our honesty and morality to be upset.\\nAs I told you, I already had conflicts with Arkan in the 1980s,\\nlong before the war, and this was repeated again and again.  We had\\nquarrels.  I was even once told by the state security service that I was\\nin danger of being assassinated by Arkan.  Stanisic Jovicic repeated this\\nin the Detention Unit of the Tribunal before many inmates.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, how can you be sure, notwithstanding\\nthat instruction, that your men, the volunteers, did not associate with\\nArkan and did not, in fact, loot?  I mean, how can you be sure?  You\\'re\\nnot there with them.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can\\'t say that not a single\\nvolunteer of the Serb Radical Party cooperated with Arkan.  There\\'s one\\ninstance that I remember very well.  In Eastern Slavonia, a certain man, a\\n\\n\\n\\nteacher from Zemun, arrived there as a volunteer of the Serb Radical\\nParty.  When his group returned from the battlefield, it was a group of\\nabout 100 men who came home after a month, he decided not to come back\\nbut, rather, to remain, and he joined Arkan.  He was killed as one of\\nArkan\\'s men.  Arkan and I met at his funeral.\\nSo, yes, there might have been exceptions, but there was no joint\\nmilitary activity.  There might have been individuals who cooperated with\\nArkan because they had interests of their own, but I constantly kept a\\ndistance from Arkan.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.  That evidence is clear.\\nMr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   This same witness, B071 says, on the 10th of April, 2003, on\\ntranscript page 18949, the beginnings of the aggression against Croatia\\ntook place from Mrkovci and Jankovci and with infiltration of Seselj\\'s\\nWhite Eagles.\\nFirst of all, what kind of aggression against Croatia is this; and\\nsecondly, what kind much men were these, these Seselj\\'s White Eagles?\\nA.   There could have been absolutely no kind of aggression.  The Serb\\npeople organised their own defence wherever they felt at threat.  I have\\nalready said that before sending volunteers to the JNA we sent a group of\\nvolunteers to Borovo Selo at the invitation of Sacorcanin [phoen].  After\\nthat, as far as I can recall, because I visited Mrkovci during the war, we\\nhad volunteers in Mrkovci as well but only as part of the JNA.  We never\\nhad anything to do with any group called the White Eagles.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was one volunteer from the Serb national renewal in Borovo\\nSelo but their name then was not the White Eagles but Dusan Silni, and he\\nwas killed as soon as the Croatian attack began even though he was not\\ncarrying a weapon at the time.  After that, we had no cooperation and no\\njoint military activities.\\nQ.   Let\\'s clarify this.  It doesn\\'t say here that you cooperated.  It\\nsays here:  \"With infiltration of Seselj\\'s White Eagles.\"  So the White\\nEagles are being ascribed to you.\\nA.   Unfortunately, this is not the only instance of Office of the\\nProsecutor bringing witnesses here who don\\'t no anything about what\\nhappened on the ground.  It\\'s simply nonsense to talk of a group called\\nSeselj\\'s White Eagles.  This simply serves to impeach both the witness and\\nthe Prosecutor who called such a witness, because this witness didn\\'t know\\nwhat he was talking about.\\nQ.   This same witness, B071, B means Bosnia, on the 10th of April,\\n2003, on page 19003 of the transcript said that \"Seselj collected men in\\nErdut, trained them there, armed them, and sent them to Bosnia.\"  Is that\\ntrue, Mr. Seselj?\\nJUDGE KWON:  Mr. Milosevic, I have to tell you that it was B1493\\nwho testified on 10th of April.  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  Well, perhaps I made a mistake\\nin my notes.  However, that is the assertion that is to be found on that\\nparticular page, and the page is 19003.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Now, did you rally people in Erdut, train them, arm them, and send\\n\\n\\n\\nthem to Bosnia?\\nA.   During the war in Eastern Slavonia, only on one occasion was I in\\nErdut, and I think that I mentioned meeting Radovan Stojicic, Badza,\\nnicknamed Badza there in Erdut on that occasion.  So that is the only\\ntime.  I would pass by Erdut in the car but without stopping.  So I was --\\nwe never sent any men there and we never had any training centre there\\neither, and I can state that quite categorically.\\nThe people from the Serbian Radical Party who went prior to the\\nwar and at the beginning of the war to Bosnia and Herzegovina were\\nexclusively within the composition of the JNA.  They were JNA men.  So I\\nabsolute -- they absolutely had nothing to do with Arkan\\'s centre in Erdut\\nlater on.  We never had anything to do with it.\\nQ.   Witness 1070, on the 7th of May, 2003, and the transcript is\\n20294, says that Arkan\\'s and Seselj\\'s men shot above the heads of the\\ncivilians who had been taken prisoner in the gym -- secondary school in\\nBratunac.  Now, did you have any men in Bratunac who did this, who\\nmistreated and abused the civilians?\\nA.   At the beginning of the war and never again later on the Serbian\\nRadical Party never had any volunteers in Bratunac, and to the best of my\\nknowledge Arkan didn\\'t appear in Bratunac either.  Arkan appeared in\\nZvornik, for example, and Bijeljina.  As far as I know, he was never in\\nBratunac either.  And I\\'ve already said that in Bratunac there was\\nDeronjic who brought in the White Eagles.  Now, what things they did there\\nI was not a witness to, but I know what Deronjic did there, and I have\\nvery certain knowledge about that, reliable knowledge.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ.   That same witness, on transcript 20351 says that Seselj\\'s men were\\nin Bratunac on the 17th of April.  Between the White Eagles and Seselj\\'s\\nmean there is no difference, says he.\\nA.   That just shows how reliable the witness is.  If he can\\'t see any\\ndifference between the volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party and the\\nWhite Eagles on the other side, then he is not well-versed in matters at\\nall.  And that\\'s not the only case.  I have seen similar instances in some\\njudgements that were made whereby witnesses stated that they happened to\\nsee in some other places Seselj\\'s White Eagles.  But as I say, that is the\\nproblem of The Hague Prosecutor and the unreliability of the witnesses\\nwhich it manipulates.\\nQ.   Witness Dzemail Becirevic also testified here and mentioned you on\\nseveral occasions, and this one is on page 20516.  He says that he saw --\\nMR. NICE:  Your Honour, I haven\\'t been able to check this myself\\nbecause the accused hasn\\'t been getting the references correct, and it\\'s\\nquite difficult to follow this material, but I think, and I\\'m grateful to\\nMs. Dicklich, the last reference said to come from the same witness came\\n(redacted).\\nBut, really, I\\'m afraid we\\'ve got to have correct references for the\\nwitnesses.  We can\\'t simply just go to the page in the transcript.\\nFrequently our page numbers don\\'t necessarily coincide here in court, and\\nwithout reference to the witnesses it\\'s very difficult to pick it up\\nlater.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, I ask you to be more careful in\\npinpointing the names of the witnesses to whom you\\'re referring.  Now,\\n\\n\\n\\nJudge Kwon has already corrected you once, and apparently there is another\\nmistake in the reference.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, perhaps there might be a\\nmistake with the name, but there is no mistake with the quotation from the\\ntranscript, and my question relates to the material facts which are being\\nmentioned here.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, we have to follow it, Mr. Milosevic.  There\\nis duty on you to be more careful.\\nPlease proceed.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. Robinson.  And I\\'ll\\ncheck this out to see whether indeed it is the same witness from\\npage 20352, the transcript line and page, the quotation that I mentioned\\nearlier on or, rather, 20351 is the exact number.  I\\'ll check that out\\nduring the break.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Now, Witness Dzemail Becirevic, on page 20516 of the transcript\\nsaid that on television he saw the occupation of Bijeljina on the 31st of\\nMarch, 2002 -- 1992 and Zvornik in which Arkan\\'s men took part as well as\\nSeselj\\'s men and the JNA.  Do you know anything about that, about the\\noccupation of Bijeljina in fact?  Did anybody in fact occupy Bijeljina on\\nthe 30th of March, 1992, and Zvornik, and what the participation was of\\nyour volunteers in those events or did they take part at all?\\nA.   First of all, nobody occupied either Zvornik or Bijeljina.  What\\nhappened there or, rather, in Zvornik there was an armed conflict between\\nthe JNA on one side and the Muslim paramilitaries on the other.  The\\n\\n\\n\\nMuslim paramilitary units in the town of Zvornik were routed very quickly.\\nHowever, there was much fighting on the fortress above Zvornik.  It went\\non for days.  The fighting went on for days there.  And in that fighting\\nthe volunteers of the Serbian Radical Party did take part.  Arkan was\\nthere, too, as was the Serbian volunteer guards.  To the best of my\\nknowledge, they did not arrive with the JNA, but they came at the call of\\nthe local Territorial Defence there.  And I think that it would be easy to\\nestablish that on the basis of documents and the way things stood on the\\nground there.\\nI know -- have reliable information that the commands and the\\nofficers of the JNA also tried to sidestep collaborating with Arkan\\'s and\\nthe Tigers or, rather, the Serbian volunteer guard, and that there was a\\ngreat deal of animosity between the two sides throughout the war, and very\\nrarely did any JNA officer wish to collaborate with Arkan.\\nAs far as Bijeljina is concerned, to the best of my knowledge,\\nover there the JNA was not involved in the local conflicts but Arkan did\\nappear.  To the best of my knowledge, most probably he appeared at the\\ncall of Biljana Plavsic.  I can\\'t prove that, but I do know that Biljana\\nPlavsic arrived in Bijeljina subsequently and that she had a very friendly\\nmeeting with Arkan in front of the television crew and in public.  The\\nvolunteers of the Serbian radical guards during the conflict in Bijeljina\\nwere not there, but there were people who had already joined up in the\\nSerbian Radical Party, but they were locals from Bijeljina.  They were\\nresidents of Bijeljina, and they rose to arms, and they took part in the\\nconflicts in Bijeljina.  But they also set a distance between themselves\\n\\n\\n\\nand Arkan, especially with Mauzer who was Arkan\\'s right-hand man.  And in\\nSerbia we didn\\'t send a single volunteer to Bijeljina ourselves.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice, may I ask you just to clarify something\\nfor me in relation to the Prosecution\\'s case.  In the Bosnia indictment\\nthe allegation is that the accused either alone or in concert with other\\nmembers of the joint criminal enterprise committed certain crimes.  As the\\nProsecution case unfolded, you\\'re not saying, are you, that he acted\\nalone.  Your case is, as I understand it, that he acted in concert with\\nother members of the joint criminal enterprise.\\nMR. NICE:  Correct.  I haven\\'t reviewed each and every allegation\\nto check that there isn\\'t one there that may be susceptible to individual\\nperpetration, but, no, the allegation is working with others.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Is that he\\'s working with others.\\nMR. NICE:  Yes.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  It seems to me that is -- that is virtually\\nyour case.  It\\'s not that he acted alone.\\nMR. NICE:  Subject to the point I\\'ve just made.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Subject to the point you\\'ve made, yes.\\nMR. NICE:  Yes.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Okay.  Thank you.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Very well, Mr. Seselj.  You\\'ve just heard that explanation too.\\nNow, since you know the relationships very well between people at that\\ntime, you know the situation, you said that Arkan was in Bijeljina and\\nZvornik yourself.  Now, did I or any organs of power and authority have\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nanything to do with Arkan\\'s volunteer guard?\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet.\\nMR. NICE:  I was just reflecting on the initial answer I gave and\\nI think perhaps there\\'s this qualification, although I don\\'t think it is a\\nqualification:  Of course one of the things that we say as against this\\naccused is that by setting in train the things that he does at the top\\npolitical level, he causes events to happen on the ground which are\\ncriminal in nature.  It\\'s the standard method of generation of\\ngenocidal-type acts as we revealed in, for example, the report of Mr. Zvar\\n[phoen].\\nNow, of course, in those circumstances, one is acting with other\\npeople.  The degree to which those people will be associated together may\\nbe minimal or non-existent on a personal and practical basis and so in\\nthose circumstances it might be appropriate to think of the accused acting\\nalone in certain circumstances, but that\\'s the only qualification I think\\nI should make.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  I think it\\'s a point that will warrant some\\nconsideration later on, yes.\\nYes, Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   So Arkan is mentioned here as well as Mauzer.  Did I or anybody\\nelse from the leadership of Serbia have anything to do with Arkan at all\\nand with Mauzer separately?  Could you explain that to us, Mr. Seselj?\\nA.   I\\'m quite certain that you had nothing to do with Arkan or Mauzer.\\nOn the Serbian political arena, everybody held back from having any open\\n\\n\\n\\ncontacts with Arkan.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you ask of this witness so many\\nquestions of a general nature without establishing the basis for the\\nevidence he\\'s giving.  So that, for example, in relation to this, I mean,\\nhow is the witness able to say whether you had anything to do with Arkan\\nor Mauzer?\\nHe\\'s giving evidence.  He\\'s saying that you had nothing to do with\\nhim.  But in order for it to be more credible, it would be important to\\nestablish how he\\'s in a position to make that statement.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, is it - how shall I put this - something secret that\\ncannot be known by others or can we claim in any way that somebody from\\nthe authorities, I, myself, or somebody else had any contacts or\\nrelationship with Arkan or Mauzer?\\nA.   In Belgrade you couldn\\'t hide anything like that.  It would be\\nimpossible to hide anything like that in Belgrade, because Belgrade is\\nthat kind of city.  Even the biggest secrets trickle down and become\\npublic.\\nSecond, Arkan on the Serbian political arena had close contacts\\nonly with Zoran Djindjic.  And I\\'ve already spoken about the relationship\\nbetween Djindjic and Mauzer.  Mauzer was Djindjic\\'s vice-president and the\\npresident of the party for Republika Srpska, and Djindjic took part in his\\npre-electoral campaign.\\nQ.   Let\\'s clarify one more point now.  In Bijeljina, for instance, did\\nyou have the kind of structure of the Serbian Radical Party as would be\\n\\n\\n\\nable to inform you precisely about all the events that took police in\\nBijeljina?\\nA.   Yes.  The Serbian Radical Party was not organised in Bijeljina\\nsufficiently at that time.  However, the people that we had there,\\nincluding Mirko Blagojevic who is mentioned in some testimony during this\\ntrial, kept me well-informed and reliably informed about all the events\\nthat went on in Bijeljina.  And at any rate, our Municipal Board in\\nBijeljina, for example, on a number of occasions made public statements\\nand held press conferences at which they energetically condemned and\\nseverely criticised Mauzer\\'s conduct, especially Mauzer\\'s conduct towards\\nthe Muslim civilians, for example.  And those documents exist, and I am\\npreparing them for my own trial, which doesn\\'t seem to be starting.\\nQ.   The same witness, Becirevic, on 20521, says that during the attack\\non the area around Konjevic Pole, Cerska and Kamenica, in addition to the\\nJNA and the so-called local Serb units, there was also participation by\\nthe Red Berets or, rather, Arkan\\'s and Seselj\\'s men.  So that\\'s the\\nquotation.  And now what is being linked and defined here is that Arkan\\'s\\nand Seselj\\'s men were together with some Red Berets.  What kind of Red\\nBerets were they?  What Arkan\\'s men were they, Seselj\\'s men were they\\naround Konjevic Pole and Kamenica that the witness is referring to?\\nA.   In testimony seems to be very confused quite obviously because the\\nwitness don\\'t seem to know what the Red Berets are.  Perhaps he happened\\nto see some soldiers wearing red berets in the form of a cap, just a red\\ncap, and then came to the conclusion that that was the name of the unit.\\nAnd then he -- the witness doesn\\'t know whether they were Seselj\\'s men or\\n\\n\\n\\nArkan\\'s men or it seems to be all the same to this witness.  So it\\'s\\nhighly imprecise, a highly imprecise testimony, a testimony off the top of\\nhis head.  And I insist upon the fact that it is impossible to identify\\nso-called Seselj\\'s men and Arkan\\'s men and these alleged Red Berets.\\nAs for the Red Berets, I\\'ve already given you reliable facts about\\nthem and said that name appeared in different situations relating to\\ndifferent military formations and units, starting with the Srpska Krajina\\narea where these people were linked to the Captain Dragan camp, and then\\nthe army of Republika Srpska where the Red Berets were warn by members of\\nthe intervention or reconnoitering units, reconnaissance units, up until\\nthe special purpose units, too, belonging to the State Security Service of\\nSerbia which was established in 1996.  And there intentionally this\\nmisunderstanding is being developed so that certain things can be ascribed\\nto people with -- which they had nothing to do with.\\nQ.   Witness Osman Selak on page 22312 of the transcript says the\\nfollowing:  \"Seselj said that all the officers of the army of Yugoslavia\\nwho were Muslims and Croats had to be replaced and this part was done.\"\\nThat\\'s when this witness claims.\\nA.   Osman Selak is not somebody who is not serious.  He\\'s a colonel by\\nrank, and throughout the war, as far as I know, he was the Chief of Staff\\nof the 1st Krajina Corps of the army of Republika Srpska.  So he was the\\nnumber two man after General Momir Talic, for example, if that\\'s the same\\nOsman Selak that you\\'re referring to.\\nQ.   Well, I can\\'t tell you that.\\nA.   Osman Selak was a high-ranking officer of the army of\\n\\n\\n\\nRepublika Srpska, and when he says that I said something somewhere, made a\\nstatement somewhere, then he must say where I said it, when I said it,\\nwhat the circumstances were in which I said it.\\nI did give a similar statement in Belgrade, for example, after the\\nsecession of individual federal units.  I called from the JNA.  Slovenia\\nseceded, and I asked that the Slovenians step down from military service,\\nand for the most part, including Admiral Stane Brovet retired, and he\\npersonally was against Slovenian separatism might I add.\\nAs far as the Muslims are concerned, the Muslims from\\nBosnia-Herzegovina no longer had any grounds for remaining in the army of\\nYugoslavia but the Muslims from the territory of Serbia or Sandzak and\\nRaska they stayed on; they remained there.  And we have a series of\\nexamples of Muslims of that kind who were officers of the Yugoslav army\\nperform their duty very honourably.\\nSo the citizens --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  I would be assisted by knowing whether you are\\nsaying that you did make such a statement or you didn\\'t make such a\\nstatement.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Bonomy, how can I know if\\nyou don\\'t show me something like that here, where and when.  Let us see\\nthe statement concerned.  Let me identify it.  I gave thousands and\\nthousands of statements in public.  They were publicly recorded.  They\\nwere published.  So let\\'s see.\\nMy objection is precisely in that.  Why did this Osman Selak not\\n\\n\\n\\nsay where and when?\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  That\\'s helpful to some extent.  Does it follow from\\nthe answer you\\'ve just given that you could have said it?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I could have said it along the\\nfollowing lines, that those in the army who came from the renegade\\nrepublics in principle should not remain at positions in the Yugoslav\\narmy.  You see, if Slovenia seceded and if all the Slovenian people live\\nin Slovenia quite literally, then why would there be Slovenian officers in\\nthe army of Yugoslavia, and what kind of authority can they have as\\nofficers?\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  That\\'s simply confusing me further.  The quote was\\nthat you said that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia who were Muslims\\nand Croats had to be replaced and that was done.  Now, are you saying that\\nyou could possibly have made that statement in these terms?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I\\'m not saying that I made that kind\\nof statement.  I did not give the kind of statement that Osman Selak\\ntestified about.  I could have made a similar statement along very precise\\nlines, but that statement has to be found.  Where, to who, when?  Osman\\nSelak saw that in the newspapers or on television, but that has to be\\nestablished.  I assume that would be the practice of this Office of the\\nProsecutor as well, to fine the mentioned newspaper and to see exactly\\nwhat I said.\\nI am never going to refute any statement I ever made to anyone,\\nbut it has to be a precise reconstruction.  What you\\'re asking me to do is\\nto comment upon a version of an alleged statement that I made in Osman\\n\\n\\n\\nSelak\\'s view or how he perceives my statement.  Well, I cannot really make\\nmy statements suit what he believes my statements might have been.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, I\\'m not asking you to do anything.  I\\'m\\ntrying to understand the answer you\\'ve given to the question asked by\\nMr. Milosevic.  And I think from what you\\'ve just said, the problem is\\nthat you\\'ve been studying this yourself, and you\\'re trying to justify a\\nposition of your own without really dealing specifically with the question\\nthat\\'s being asked of you, and the simple answer to the question appears\\nnow to be that you couldn\\'t possibly have made a statement of that nature,\\nalthough you might have said something much more specific about different\\npeople but not just in general about Muslims and Croats.\\nNow, is that a fair summary of your position?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I\\'m not sure, by think you\\'re\\nvery close.  However, in order to help you, I\\'m going to give you an\\nexample.\\nThroughout 1991 and even in 1992, from time to time we were\\ninformed of the following:  Such-and-such an officer, an ethnic Croat,\\nescaped from Serbia to Croatia.  Many of them took carloads of\\nconfidential documents with them.  As a matter of fact, sometime in 1998\\nwe had the following situation:  Robert Ivanovic, a Croat, commander of\\nthe military music band of the 1st Army District in Belgrade went with his\\nfamily abroad legally and then he went to Croatia and he still lives\\nthere.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Seselj, this doesn\\'t remotely sound as if it\\'s\\ngoing to be at all helpful to me, so we\\'ll proceed with Mr. Milosevic\\'s\\n\\n\\n\\nquestions.  You have to bear in mind that the question that was put to you\\nwas about a statement made by a witness that was plainly a racist\\nstatement, and why it should be so difficult to deal with such a simple\\nissue I\\'m not at all sure.  However, Mr. Milosevic can explore it further\\nif he wishes.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sir --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Let Mr. Milosevic ask the next question.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have to --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Please, Mr. Robinson.  I protest in\\nno uncertain terms because of the qualification made by Mr. Bonomy that\\nany statement of mine could have considered racist.  First of all, never\\nin my life have I made a racist statement.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Judge Bonomy never said that, Mr. Seselj.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He just did.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  No, he never said that.  Not at all.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj --\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, he just said so just now.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  There\\'s nothing for you to respond to.\\nMr. Milosevic, the next question.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, I\\'m afraid that this is a pure misunderstanding.  I\\nput a concrete question to you.  In order to spell it out in more specific\\nterms and in order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding it was stated\\n\\n\\n\\nhere that \"Seselj had stated that all officers of the army of Yugoslavia\\nwho were Muslims or Croats would have to be removed.\"  Did you ever state\\nthat?\\nA.   No, I didn\\'t say it that way.\\nQ.   So you didn\\'t say it that way --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues]... matter.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  And why on earth it should take all this time to\\nestablish that simple issue, I do not know.\\nPerhaps it would help, Mr. Seselj, if you just listened to the\\nquestions and answer the question that\\'s actually asked rather than try to\\nmake political statements about your own position.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic --\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I\\'m not making political statements,\\nMr. Bonomy.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, Witness Baron van Linden spoke about you here.  He\\nmentioned only a few facts, so I would like to ask you to check whether\\nthose facts are correct.  And first of all, I\\'m interested in the\\ncircumstances involved if it did happen.  The page is 26758.  \"Just after\\nthe bombing Seselj came to Pale.\"  And then on page 26762 he\\nsays:  \"Seselj came to Pale immediately after the first NATO ultimatum to\\nsupport the Bosnian Serbs.\"  These are a few facts that referred to.\\nCould you please explain the circumstances involved.  What is this\\nactually all about?\\nA.   I went to Pale several times, and whenever the leadership of\\n\\n\\n\\nRepublika Srpska was under pressure from the West I publicly supported the\\nleadership of Republika Srpska, because the Western powers were openly\\nengaged in an anti-Serb policy.\\nAs for the Markale Market, the two explosions, one at the market\\nitself, and the other one near the market as well as the explosion in the\\nstreet of Vasa Miskin at the partisan cemetery near the old brewery, these\\nare explosions that were organised by the Muslim leadership, regardless of\\nwhether the explosives were planted on the actual spot or whether mortar\\nshells were fired from elsewhere at one of these sites.\\nThis was a trigger event that was staged in order to accuse the\\nSerbs and to justify the sanctions that were imposed immediately, the\\nthreats that were made, and so on and so forth.\\nQ.   So, Mr. Seselj, if I understood you correctly, when you went there\\nyou did so only to give political support to the leadership of\\nRepublika Srpska in situations when they were exposed to pressure and\\nbombing.\\nA.   Yes.\\nQ.   Witness B1445 said on page 27608:  \"In January or February\\n1992\" -- please bear the dates in mind, January, February 1992, \"Arkan\\'s\\nand Seselj\\'s units arrived in Doboj.\"\\nIs this a fact?  Is it founded on facts at all?\\nA.   No.  It is absolutely impossible.  In January or February 1992,\\nthere were no military operations in Doboj and the surrounding area.\\nSecondly, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not sent to\\nDoboj even through the JNA.  As far as I know, Arkan\\'s Tigers never\\n\\n\\n\\noperated in Doboj either.  This is a total fabrication.\\nQ.   Now, could you please give as precise an answer as possible to\\nthis question.  It has to do with witness Sead Omeragic who said on\\ntranscript page 27738, quite explicitly, \"Mirko Blagojevic,\" that is to\\nsay, that official of yours that you mentioned a while ago, he\\nsays:  \"Mirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina,\\nand he was a member of the Serb Radical Party and had contacts with\\nSeselj.\"\\nI am not asking you whether he was a member of the Serb Radical\\nParty or whether he had contacts with you, but this assertion made that\\nMirko Blagojevic was the organiser of the conflict in Bijeljina.  So\\nplease deal with that assertion of this witness which is contained in the\\ntranscript.  Is it correct or not?\\nA.   First and foremost a conflict is not organised.  An attack is\\norganised, defence is organised, but a conflict is not organised.  A\\nconflict occurs when two armed formations clash.\\nMirko Blagojevic took part in the conflict that occurred in\\nBijeljina but only in the military armed conflict.  When the Muslim\\nformations were defeated, Mirko Blagojevic no longer participated in any\\nconflicts.  And I guarantee with my own life that he took part in no\\nlooting, no persecutions, no maltreatment of the civilian population and\\nso on and so forth.  I\\'m absolutely certain of that.\\nQ.   Thank you.\\nA.   I can fully identify with everything that Mirko Blagojevic did.\\nIt is to that degree that I\\'m certain that he never did anything against\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe law.\\nQ.   Witness B1780, on transcript pages 28220 and 221 says:  \"Seselj\\'s\\nmen tortured prisoners at the Ekonomija farm.\"\\nA.   Where is this Ekonomija farm?\\nQ.   My understanding is it\\'s somewhere near Zvornik.\\nA.   That\\'s quite impossible too.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical\\nParty took part in the Zvornik operation while the JNA was operating there\\nin brief fighting in town itself and somewhat longer fighting that went on\\nfor a few days on the fortress above the town where the resistance of the\\nMuslim paramilitaries was quite strong.  Once the conflict was brought to\\nan end, the JNA withdrew, and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\\nwithdrew.\\nI preclude any possibility of having the volunteers engaged on\\nguarding prisoners of war or detaining civilians.  Had that kind of thing\\nhappened, I would have had to know about it.\\nQ.   All right.  Mirsad Kucanin, another witness, claims that you\\npersonally killed a Serb named Vasiljevic under the following\\ncircumstances:  On transcript page 28966, he says the following:  \"Seselj,\\non Serb television, indicated a 7.9 calibre weapon and he personally fired\\nit at Muslims in Sarajevo.\"  This was shown on television, and he said\\nthat you permanently killed a Serb called Vasiljevic there.\\nA.   First of all, I remember what happened very well.  I was at\\nGrbavica.  At that time, under the protection of the so-called\\ninternational observers, the Muslims tried by digging trenches to go\\naround the Serb positions on the outskirts of Sarajevo and to attack the\\n\\n\\n\\nSerb forces from the back.  From Grbavica 1, from the building which was\\nan apartment building but due to Muslim fire it was totally destroyed, I\\nused a Browning machine-gun from there.  It\\'s a heavy machine-gun.  I\\ncouldn\\'t carry it anywhere.  It is a heavy machine-gun.  You cannot carry\\nit around.\\nQ.   But he says on page 28967 that you carried a Browning.\\nA.   You cannot carry it.  It\\'s too long.  It was installed in that\\nbuilding, and I used that Browning to target the Muslims in the trenches\\nbelow the UN observation posts.  I was firing from the Browning.  Some of\\nthe volunteers from the Serb Radical Party from the Jewish cemetery was\\nfiring from a recoilless gun, and the trenches were still being dug, and\\nthe top of the trenches was hit.  Whether somebody got killed there is\\nsomething I don\\'t know.  It could have only been the Muslim soldiers who\\ncould have been killed, because -- and that would please me, because this\\nsmall participation of mine in the war had thereby yielded some effects.\\nA Serb in the Muslim army could have been killed there.  In that\\ncase, he was the enemy.  Also, it could have been a Serb who had been\\nforced by the Muslims to dig trenches.  Then his killing is the fault of\\nthose who in violation of international law of war brought him out there\\nto dig trenches, not those who --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   What Witness Miroslav Deronjic said, is that true, on page 29626,\\nthat at the beginning of April Seselj\\'s men arrived in the area of\\nBratunac and Zvornik.\\n\\n\\n\\nA.   That is an intentional fabrication on Deronjic\\'s part.  He knows\\nfull well who he brought to the Bratunac area.  However, you see, knowing\\nwho he brought to Bratunac, he is linking up Zvornik and Bratunac and\\nmaking this sweeping statement Seselj\\'s men arrived in Bratunac and\\nZvornik.  If they arrived in Zvornik, it\\'s as if they were in Bratunac\\ntoo.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in Bratunac, so\\nDeronjic invented that.\\nIn Bratunac there were the locals organised by Deronjic into the\\nBratunac Brigade.  At the beginning of the war it was Deronjic who was\\ncommander of the Bratunac Brigade and then he had to withdraw because he\\nwas not a trained officer in any way.  When the army was consolidated,\\nthen a professional officer came to be commander of the Bratunac Brigade.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Slow down.  I think the interpreter is having\\nsome difficulty.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will.\\nYou could have noticed, Mr. Robinson, that I have been trying as\\nof late to speak slowly, but sometimes, every now and then, I may forget\\nwhat you cautioned me about.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, I had noticed, and the -- we are\\nappreciative of the effort you are making.  You have answered the\\nquestion.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the meantime --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  I think you have answered that question.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   So they were not in Bratunac at all?\\n\\n\\n\\nA.   No.  The volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not in\\nBratunac.\\nQ.   All right.  So you are saying that he\\'s not telling the truth.\\nThe same witness, Deronjic, on page 29737, said that he does not\\nagree that Seselj was a true opposition.\\nA.   The Hague OTP and Judge Schomburg on several occasions caught\\nDeronjic lying.  And even in Deronjic\\'s judgement you can find about seven\\ndifferent points as ascertained by Judge Schomburg, namely that Deronjic\\nwas lying.\\nSecondly, in the case of people who are inclined to a pro-Western\\npolicy or are mercenaries of Western intelligence agencies, or in order to\\nsave their own skin they go into plea bargaining with the OTP and\\ntherefore appear as witnesses in the trials of other people, it can often\\nbe heard that those who are really opposition but are not prepared to\\nserve the West --\\nMR. NICE:  I\\'m not sure this is responsive to any question --\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Are you interrupting me?\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Nice is on his feet, Mr. Seselj, and he\\'s\\nentitled to make an objection if he wishes.\\nMR. NICE:  He was simply asked if the man was telling the truth.\\nWe have his answer and he\\'s now gone on to a long comment basically.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, you have moved into the area of comment.\\nIt\\'s now time for the break.\\nMr. Nice, I should say the question that I asked earlier related\\nto the Bosnia indictment.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe will break for 20 minutes.\\n--- Recess taken at 3.41 p.m.\\n--- On resuming at 4.08 p.m.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, you told me to check\\nthe pages that Mr. Nice mentioned, 35 -- 20352 and 20351, that is.  This\\nwas Witness 1070.\\nOn page 20351 he says that Seselj\\'s men were in Bratunac and that\\nthere was no difference between them and Seselj\\'s men, the White Eagles,\\nthat is.\\nAnd on page 20352, he says that between the 20-something of April\\nSeselj\\'s and Arkan\\'s men were in Bratunac together when some people were\\ndeported.  And Mr. Seselj answered questions about this.  In the meantime,\\nthe liaison officer had the transcript, and I have received a note saying\\nthat both references are correct, both as regards page 20351 and 20352,\\nand these refer to Witness 1070.  There was no error.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  All right, Mr. Milosevic.  We\\'ll do our own\\ncheck.  Thank you for checking anyhow.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, this is the testimony of Miroslav Deronjic, who said\\nthat you were not truly an opposition politician or, rather, that you\\ncooperated with the government and that therefore this idea of a joint\\ncriminal enterprise is thereby confirmed.  Were you in the opposition or\\nnot?\\nTHE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Mr. Seselj.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I personally -- I switched it\\non.\\nBoth the Serb Radical Party and I personally throughout this time\\nwere distinctly in the opposition.  We were as far in the opposition as\\nit\\'s possible to be.  From the ideological perspective now adopted by\\nDeronjic, only foreign mercenaries were considered to be in the\\nopposition.  Western mercenaries, Western agents, this was a standpoint\\noften expressed in the media that were financed by the West, by various\\ngovernment and non-government organisations.  In their view, a true person\\nof the opposition was only someone who took instructions from Zimmerman or\\nMiles, the US ambassadors, in Belgrade.  Who was the next one, Montgomery\\nand so on.  Those who always spoke from patriotic positions while\\ncriticising the government were not deemed to be proper opposition\\npoliticians, and this logic is completely upside down.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Witness Ahmet Zulic says, and that\\'s on page 30000 of the\\ntranscript, he says that Seselj\\'s men were stationed in the partisan\\ncemetery in Pobrezje, that doesn\\'t matter so much but what matters is the\\nfollowing, that they had come there to kill the Muslims.\\nA.   Where is this place?  Pobrezje?  Where is it?\\nQ.   I have a note here in Pobrezje.  I can\\'t be more specific than\\nthat.\\nBut let me put a question to you:  Did your volunteers go anywhere\\nto kill all Muslims?\\nA.   No.  Nowhere did the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party go to\\n\\n\\n\\nkill Muslims or Croats or any kind of civilians.  Wherever they went, they\\nwere part of the JNA, and they went there to fight against the\\nparamilitary units that wanted to break up Yugoslavia.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, it\\'s important to know the\\nlocation.  I\\'m not sure whether Mr. Nice or Mr. Kay can help.  Your note\\ndoesn\\'t identify clearly the name of this place?\\nMR. NICE:  I tried to make an electronic search but for various\\nreasons it doesn\\'t work at the moment or doesn\\'t work for this witness on\\nthis particular part of his evidence.  I\\'ll try again.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\\nJUDGE KWON:  You said Pobrezje.\\nProceed, Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   The same witness, Ahmet Zulic, on page 30047, says in Sanski Most\\nthere was no fighting, but the civilians fled because Seselj\\'s men were\\nthere.\\nYour men caused fear among civilians, although there was no\\nfighting there, as he says, in Sanski Most.\\nA.   That is pure fabrication, because throughout the Bosnian Krajina,\\nthroughout the Bosnian Krajina volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did\\nnot fight in any location.\\nThis reminds me of a well-known anecdote which says that in a\\ncertain place inhabited by Muslims there was a notice on a shop saying\\nthat sugar was arriving.  This was when there was a shortage of sugar.\\nSomebody read this wrong and started yelling Seselj is arriving, Seselj is\\n\\n\\n\\narriving, and he spread panic.\\nTHE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter\\'s note that the Serbian word for\\nsugar resembles Mr. Seselj\\'s name.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] So there were no volunteers anywhere\\nin that area.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Look at paragraph 32 and what it says.  In says here:  \"From the\\n1st of March or thereabouts until the 31st of December, 1995, Slobodan\\nMilosevic, acting alone or in concert with other members of the joint\\ncriminal,\" and so on,\"planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise\\naided and abetted,\" and so on and so forth, all these phrases, \"the\\nplanning, preparation of the Bosnian Muslims as such living in territories\\nof Bijeljina, Bosanski Novo, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,\\nSanski Most, and Srebrenica.\"\\nTell me now, Mr. Seselj, as you mentioned here as a participant in\\nthis joint criminal enterprise and you are being charged with alleged\\ncrimes in these places, is there any basis for these allegations made\\nhere?\\nA.   No, there is absolutely no basis whatsoever, because no one from\\nSerbia caused conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Conflicts in Bosnia\\nand Herzegovina were caused by those who one-sidedly, unilaterally, wanted\\nto proclaim the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina contrary to the\\nwill of the Serb people who were a constituent nation and by those in the\\nWest who supported them.  There was no planning, no preparation or\\nexecution or extermination.  There was no plan.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised, in\\nmany places there was simply an assault on the local government, not only\\nwhere the Serbs were in majority but also where the Muslims or the Croats\\nwere in the majority, although the Croats took a lot in 1991.  In 1991,\\nnot a single municipality in Western Herzegovina where the Croats were the\\nmajority population recognised the central government in Sarajevo.  They\\nhad already seceded from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That was in 1991.\\nQ.   In paragraph 32, which I quoted, apart from Bijeljina where we\\nhave already established who was there, Mauzer and Arkan, that is, the\\nother places mentioned are Bosanski Novi, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Prijedor,\\nSanski Most, and Srebrenica.  Was anyone from Serbia there participated in\\nany kind of military activities?\\nA.   As far as I know, no.  You see, as regards Srebrenica, sometime in\\nJanuary, in early 1993, Srebrenica was already a UN protected area, but\\nthe UN troops did nothing to disarm the Muslim units in Srebrenica,\\nalthough they were duty-bound to do so.  The protection zone was\\nestablished, provided that all Muslim armed units in Srebrenica be\\n\\ndisarmed.  That was the only way a protected area could function.\\nThe Muslim forces from Srebrenica made incursions into Serbian\\nvillages and killed many Serb civilians.  In the beginning of 1993, there\\nwere two groups of volunteers from the Serb Radical Party who were active\\nin the Skelani area, and they hurried to help the surrounded Serb forces\\nin the area of Jezero.  This was in 1993 in Srebrenica.  And that is the\\nonly activity of volunteers of the Serb Radical Party in the Srebrenica\\narea.  It was in the beginning of 1993.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, and Sanski Most,\\nI don\\'t know anyone from Serbia who went to fight there.  Arkan turned up\\nonly in 1995, when because of the NATO bombing, which was systematic all\\nover Serbia, a Muslim-Croat offensive was launched where the regular army\\nof the Republic of Croatia participated and led the offensive.  Bosanska\\nKrajina was about to fall, and that was when Arkan turned up with his\\nvolunteer guard, and I think that was his last involvement in the wars\\nthere, in Sanski Most and Prijedor.\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, you know very well what kind of policy we proclaimed\\nand what kind of policy we implemented at the time.  How does this policy\\nthat we implemented correspond to what is alleged here, the destruction in\\nwhole or in part, and then they list all these towns in Bosnia and\\nHerzegovina?\\nA.   This is absolutely impossible.  There was no such policy, and\\nthere was no destruction that was planned.  Everything that did happen\\nhappened because of incidents caused by individuals and groups acting on\\ntheir own initiative, renegade groups, but there was no plan to commit\\nmurders or anything of the kind.\\nQ.   As in this Bosnia indictment, everything that happened in the war\\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina is mentioned and charged against me and the\\nother participants of the joint criminal enterprise as formulated by\\nMr. Nice.\\nLook at paragraph 33.  We\\'ve just been discussing paragraph 32.  I\\nwon\\'t read the beginning of paragraph 33 because it\\'s the same:  \"From on\\nor about the 1st of March, 1992,\" and so on and so forth, and then it\\n\\n\\n\\nsays:  \"On the territory of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa,\\nBosanski Novi, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Sarajevo (Ilijas), Kljuc,\\nKalinovik, Kotor Varos, Nevesinje, Sarajevo, Novi Grad, Sarajevo, Novo\\nSarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Rudo, Sanski Most, Srebrenica\\nagain, Teslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\"  Please --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  You are finished reading that list.  Let me\\nremind you, Mr. Milosevic, that the Rule 98 bis decision found that there\\nwas not enough evidence to support the allegation in paragraph 32 in\\nrelation to some of the villages or municipalities mentioned.  In fact, as\\nfar as paragraph 32 is concerned, you need only concern yourself with\\nBrcko, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Srebrenica, Bijeljina, Kotor Varos, Kljuc,\\nBosanski Novi.  And I am checking to see whether the decision affected\\nparagraph 33.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, could you please let\\nme know what evidence, as you say there was no evidence for these places,\\nbut what was the evidence that Mr. Nice presented here about the other\\nplaces linking me --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic.  Mr. Milosevic, the Rule 98 bis\\ndecision was published and was available to you.  But I bring that to your\\nattention so we don\\'t waste time.  And I\\'ll ask the legal officer to give\\nme the information in relation to paragraph 33.\\nGo ahead, Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   As I was saying, Mr. Seselj, I read out a list here.  It\\'s a long\\nparagraph with all the names of the towns where I, together with others,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nam charged with working for the extermination of Muslims and Croats.  You\\nknow the policy of Serbia from that day as you are of all the actions that\\nreferred to the course of the war in Croatia and Bosnia.  Is this grounded\\nin any fact at all, any fact that you could quote?\\nA.   Absolutely not.  Because nobody from Serbia, even had they wanted\\nto, would have been able to cause a civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A\\ncivil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was caused by those who unilaterally\\nwanted the Serb people over there to relinquish their status of a\\nconstituent people.\\nAnd the question arises from there where are the Serbs from\\nMostar, from Capljina, from Livno, the Serbs from Zenica, the Serbs from\\nTravnik?  Where are the Serbs from Maglaj, for instance, or the Serbs from\\nmany other places which were taken control of by the Muslims or Croats\\nduring that civil war?\\nAfter the civil war broke out there was a great movement in the\\npopulation, both spontaneous, sometimes forceful.  Sometimes crimes did\\ntake place, but there was this general aspiration for everybody to join,\\nin figurative terms, their own birds of a feather flocking together, if I\\ncan put it that way.  So in that war crimes were committed.  Sometimes\\ncrimes were in response to crimes that had been committed previously,\\nsometimes it was criminals committing crimes through base motives,\\ncriminal motives.  Sometimes there was the urge for retaliation and\\nrevenge.  But on the Serb side, planned organised and systematic crimes\\ndid not exist.  That did not happen.\\nQ.   Now, as this refers to me myself and the other members of the\\n\\n\\n\\njoint criminal enterprise as it is alleged, including yourself, I\\'d like\\nto draw your attention to the time from the 1st of March to the 31st of\\nDecember, 1995, from 1992 to 1995, and in paragraph 32 and paragraph 33\\nand indeed paragraph 36 which I cannot understand because the same towns\\nare repeated there.  The same qualifications are given for those towns\\ntoo.  And then later on in paragraph 37 again.\\nSo what was it that we dealt in?  What was it that we did during\\nthat period of time, that is to say, between March 1992 and the end of\\nDecember 1995, which was linked to the civil war in our neighbouring\\nBosnia and Herzegovina?\\nA.   After the withdrawal of the JNA, on the 19th of May, 1992, Serbia\\nor, rather, the authorities in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of\\nYugoslavia in no way whatsoever took part in the war and war actions.  It\\ndid not send any armed units or formations, but it was its duty to help\\nmaterially, in material terms, to help Republika Srpska and the Serbs\\nliving over there.  So that was a period of time which showed different\\npolitical relationships between Serbia and Yugoslavia and the leadership\\nof Republika Srpska on the other side.  Sometimes there was a period in\\nwhich those relationships were good, and sometimes there were deep\\nconflicts, and they didn\\'t see eye-to-eye on many issues.\\nSo throughout that time, throughout this period covered by the\\nindictment and that you -- they are trying to attempt to charge you with,\\nthe leadership of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia persevered\\nin looking for solutions to the problem and sometimes went too far\\naccepting the conditions of the peace plan which we Serb nationalists\\n\\n\\n\\nattacked ourselves for our part.\\nSo I cannot congratulate you on those aspects of your policy\\ndating back from that time, but based on the facts I insist upon the fact\\nthat that policy was waged in order to find a peaceful solution at all\\ncosts.  That is to say, the slogans of your party was there is no\\nalternative to peace.  You wanted peace at all cost, at any price, even at\\nthe price of making concessions which the Serbs were not able to accept\\nbecause they were not able to take such great concessions.\\nQ.   Very well.  Now, bearing in mind that practice and the activities\\nof that period, how can you explain that somebody can enumerate all these\\ntowns here in Bosnia in which allegedly the leadership of Serbia and I\\npersonally committed these crimes, ordered, aided and abetted, organised,\\net cetera, the wording of the indictment.  Do you have any reason\\nexplanation?\\nA.   Yes, I do, and that\\'s explanation is the following and the fact\\nthat through you they are trying to try Serbia and the entire Serb people,\\nand --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an answer.  In any event, it is not\\nan explanation that it is appropriate for you to give.\\nSo please ask another question, Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, paragraph 36 goes on to mention Banja Luka, Bihac,\\nBijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Samac, Bratunac\\nagain, Brcko again, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca again, Gacko, different places in\\nSarajevo, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Srebrenica,\\n\\n\\n\\nTeslic, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.  Do you have anything to say with\\nregard to that point of the indictment?\\nA.   I claim that in these places there was no systematic organised\\ncrime.  However, crimes did happen.  I don\\'t know whether in all the\\nplaces enumerated here but in many of them.  There were crimes that took\\nplace in many of these places but it is not at all difficult for each\\nindividual crime to establish exactly who the perpetrator was and what the\\nmotives were.  Because not too much time has gone by.  Many people are\\nstill living both among the victims and the criminals, and everything can\\nbe established.  Everything can be established both on the Bosnian side\\nand the Croatian side as well.  There is no goodwill to do so, to\\ninvestigate all the crimes.  And attempts are being made artificially to\\nstrike a balance, including The Hague Tribunal and its indictment with the\\nnumber of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims brought to trial and charged.\\nQ.   Let us now dwell for a moment on what you\\'ve said when you said\\nthat some crimes were committed in some of these towns.  Let\\'s look at\\nthat for a moment.  What is the link between Serbia, the FRY, the army of\\nYugoslavia or the police for that matter or any kind, armed forces or\\nformations or units of the Republic of Serbia with any of those crimes\\nthat you know of?  Are there any links?\\nA.   There could not have been any links at all.  All the organs of\\npower and authority in Serbia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as\\nwell, all serious political organisations and political parties of Serbia,\\nthe Serbian Orthodox Church, the cultural institutions stemming from the\\nAcademy of Science to the Association of Writers, et cetera, et cetera,\\n\\n\\n\\neverybody was against and came out against crimes.  They all spoke out\\nagainst them, and they all supported the just fight of the Serb people for\\nfreedom.  But all of them at the same time condemned the crimes that were\\nbeing perpetrated on the Serb side, too, and appealed that no crimes\\nshould be committed.  And the media were full of statements of that kind\\nvia the state organs, the church, the cultural institutions and political\\nparties.  There is not a single fact or organisation in Serbia which\\nstrove in favour of crimes, and all political, cultural, and other factors\\nspoke out against crimes.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Now, we -- let\\'s look at paragraph 37, which talks about unlawful\\nconfinement or imprisonment under inhumane conditions of Bosnian Muslims,\\nBosnian Croats, and then the following places are enumerated on the\\nterritories of Banja Luka, Bihac, Bijeljina, Bileca, Bosanska Krupa, Novi,\\nSamac, Bratunac, Brcko, Cajnice, Doboj, Foca, Gacko, Kljuc, Kalinovik,\\nKotor Varos and Nevesinje, Prijedor, Rogatica.  Sanski Most, Teslic,\\nVisegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik.\\nTell us, please, Mr. Seselj, what unlawful confinement of these\\npeople in these towns did we take part in?\\nA.   The power and authorities in Serbia and Yugoslavia could not have\\nhad anything to do with any such thing.\\nFirst of all, we should differentiate between the following:  What\\nthe confinement of prisoners of war means and what the confinement of\\ncivilians means.  It is unlawful to confine civilians.  That is what is\\n\\n\\n\\nunlawful, and there were such cases.\\nNow, how can I explain them to the best of my knowledge?  First of\\nall, there were individual instances in some of these places through the\\nself-will of people from the local authorities.  I mentioned the instance\\nof Simo Drljaca, for example, who was killed when he was being arrested.\\nAnd then many people bear responsibility through -- without any fault of\\ntheir own because they couldn\\'t influence him.  He appeared as a factor,\\nand there was no control over him.  Nobody could control him, and his\\nmotives were of a criminal nature.\\nThere were other such cases in some of these places whereby\\nsomebody confined people unlawfully, members of non-Serb ethnic groups in\\norder to put them up for bribes, I mentioned Mauzer, in order to receive\\nmoney and then release them once they received money for that.  There were\\nalso instances of revenge and retaliation where somebody had suffered,\\nsomebody\\'s family members had suffered at the hands of the Muslims or\\nCroats, and they wanted to seek revenge.  And the authorities very often\\nwere not able to prevent revenge of that kind.\\nQ.   Which authorities?\\nA.   The authorities in Republika Srpska.\\nQ.   But what about the authority in Serbia?  Could the Serbian\\nauthorities intervene?\\nA.   No.  The authorities in Serbia couldn\\'t influence or involve\\nthemselves in any such matters.\\nSo as I say, there were cases and instances of that kind, but one\\nshould take a look at each of these cases and see what the background to\\n\\n\\n\\nthose cases are, hot perpetrators were, how the crime was committed and\\nwhat the motives were and then the situation will become clearer.\\nNow, what happens here?  Here we have an enumeration of places\\nwhere possibly some crimes had taken place and they are extracted out of\\ncontext and then an a priori general phrases are used to accuse\\ntop-ranking politicians, not only of Republika Srpska but those of Serbian\\nYugoslavia as well.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, by this time it is becoming -- it has\\nbecome a feature of your evidence that in response to the allegations you\\nsay that there may have been individual acts of criminality but nothing\\nlike the systematic, organised, group acts of criminality that are alleged\\nby the indictment, alleged by the Prosecution.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You didn\\'t understand me correctly,\\nMr. Robinson.  There was -- there were group crimes, group criminality,\\nbut there was no systematic, organised criminality on the part of the top\\nechelons of power, to be more precise.  So first of all, it is absolutely\\nimpossible for the authorities in Serbia to have organised anything like\\nthat, and in Yugoslavia either.  To the best of my knowledge, it is\\nimpossible that the authorities of Republika Srpska had organised any such\\nthing, but there were individuals from those echelons of power who did\\ncommit crimes.  And it wasn\\'t only individuals who committed crimes.\\nThere was group -- there was group criminality, too, group crimes too.\\nAnd I mentioned several examples that I know about on the basis of my\\ninformation, but I can\\'t be well-versed in everything, but I can in\\nbasics, and therefore I can claim what I just did, what I just said.  It\\n\\n\\n\\nwasn\\'t the policy of the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia to commit\\ncrimes, to persecute Muslims or Croats.  It wasn\\'t the policy of the\\nleadership of Republika Srpska either, for that matter.\\nNow, --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  And it wasn\\'t the policy of this accused in\\nconcert with other --\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That certainly was not the policy of\\nMr. Milosevic.  Quite the contrary.  Mr. Milosevic constantly,\\ncontinuously and openly and resolutely came out publicly against such\\ncrimes being committed, against any criminality appearing, especially the\\nmost serious form of war crimes.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Paragraph 40 is too long for me to quote.  There\\'s an enormous\\nlist of towns there from Bosnia-Herzegovina, lots of towns in that list,\\nand the subject here is deportation.\\nNow, Mr. Seselj, help me how here.  Let\\'s clarify that.  Albeit in\\nSerbia, according to official date, about 70.000 Muslims fled to Serbia,\\nMuslim refugees fled to Serbia during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\\n70.000 of them when they were treated in Serbia awarding to the principle\\nof non-discrimination like anybody else.\\nNow, I can\\'t clear up this point here.  Perhaps our leadership is\\nbeing accused for taking in those refugees who fled from the war, or is it\\nstated here -- it says:  \"Milosevic, acting alone or together with other\\nmembers of the joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered,\\n\\n\\n\\ncommitted, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or\\nexecution of the unlawful forcible transfer...\"\\nNow, Mr. Seselj, did Milosevic or any other organ of the Republic\\nof Serbia did -- do anything to force anybody to move lawfully or\\nunlawfully?  If you have lawful forcible movement, then you have unlawful\\nmovement too.  So did the -- an organ of Serbia even try to move one\\nindividual?\\nA.   These organs of Serbia could not have had anything to do with\\nanything like that.  Second, the state organs of Serbia condemned these\\nphenomena and similar phenomena if they knew about them.  Thirdly, what\\ndid happen was that there was the desire on the part of one ethnic group\\nto leave the area they had inhabited by another ethnic group, and that\\ndesire was expressed much before the armed conflict broke out.  There were\\ninstances of that kind throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That is to say,\\nthat people wanted to move out because they felt something in the air,\\nsomething afoot.  They felt that war might be imminent, bearing in mind\\nwhat had happened in Croatia, the Croatian federal unit.  They wanted to\\nmove out.  Anybody who had relatives in other parts of Yugoslavia or\\nperhaps abroad, and if they had enough money to do so, they left -- they\\nwere the first to leave.  So that was something that could be proved, and\\nin some trials before The Hague Tribunal this was proved and established\\nin some of the judgements.  And I know of a specific example, a concrete\\nexample, a case in point.  This is what happened:  A group of Muslims from\\nPrijedor wished to move onto the territory under Muslim control, and a\\nconvoy was organised to transport them to Travnik, I think it was --\\n\\n\\n\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj, I\\'m stopping you because you have\\nanswered the question.  You are becoming a little too expansive.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think that this would be very\\nimportant.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, what example do you know of personally?\\nA.   I\\'m talking about one example when Muslims were transported\\nbecause they wanted to go to territory that was under Muslim control.  And\\nthen the policeman who was leading the convoy for security reasons, whose\\nname is Darko Mrdja, he stopped the convoy at a particular site which is\\ncalled Koricanske Stijene, if I remember correctly.  He took out a large\\ngroup of Muslims and executed them arbitrarily.  When he returned, the\\nauthorities tried to arrest him.  He fled to a completely different part\\nof Republika Srpska, and under a different name he signed up with the army\\nof Republika Srpska in order to avoid arrest.\\nThen he tried to explain this in a completely different way:\\nSomebody ordered him to do so, but he cannot say who it was, so he\\'s\\ntrying to shift blame elsewhere and things like that.\\nSuch people, when they were prosecuted before The Hague Tribunal,\\nentered plea bargains with the OTP, then they get a mild sentence, and\\nthen they appear in other trials, and their statements are believed\\nalthough they are invariably false because --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  I\\'m stopping you.  Mr. Seselj, no doubt you\\'re a\\nman of many virtues.  Is omniscience one of them?  How do you happen to\\nknow all these things?  I have to ask myself that question, Mr. Milosevic.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Where is your knowledge coming from?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, all my life I have\\nbeen learning, learning, learning, and constantly learning.  Even now in\\nprison I read eight to ten hours a day, although the conditions under\\nwhich I live are very poor because they want to prevent me from preparing\\nmy defence case properly.  But I\\'m a constant learner, and I wish others\\nwere too.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  It would help my appreciation of your evidence if\\nonly occasionally we were told of the basis for the information that you\\nhave about specific matters.\\nYes, Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, a short while ago you said that the leadership of\\nSerbia and I personally could not have participated in any such thing and\\nthat as a matter of fact we acted in a completely opposite manner.  Upon\\nwhat do you base this statement?\\nA.   I have a series of sources of information and grounds on which I\\nbase my information and statements.  First of all, the consistent\\nstatements made by the authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia in that area.\\nSecondly, the concrete behaviour of the authorities of Serbia.\\nThey never discriminated in terms of taking in refugees.  They never\\ndiscriminated against any ethnic group.  It is impossible for the\\nauthorities from Serbia to take part in the persecution of Muslims in\\nBosnia whereas at the same time they were readily admitting them to Serbia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand treating them the same way they treat Orthodox Serbs and others.\\nSo there is not a shred of common sense in this, no logic\\nwhatsoever.  Why would the authorities of Serbia take part in persecution\\nof Muslims against Bosnia while taking in thousands of Muslim refugees in\\nSerbia and spending a lot of money on them?  Refugees require a great deal\\nof money.  Perhaps not all of them were happy with what they got, but this\\ninvolved major expenditure on the part of the state.\\nQ.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  But did the authorities of Serbia allow\\ndiscrimination over any Muslim Croat or the member of any other ethnic\\ngroup in Serbia during the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia?\\nA.   No.  Even if there were any incidents on ethnic grounds, the\\nauthorities acted in accordance with the law and brought such matters to\\ntrial.  They simply did not allow things like that to happen.\\nQ.   Please look at paragraph 42 now.  Again it says here:  \"Slobodan\\nMilosevic,\" and so on and so forth, on or about the 1st of March, 1992,\\nuntil 391st of December, 1995, acting alone or in concert with members of\\nthe joint criminal enterprise, planned, instigated, ordered, committed or\\notherwise aided and abetted the planning preparation or execution of\\nwanton destruction and plunder of the public and private property of the\\nBosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations and then\" --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, too fast.  Too fast.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   So I, Mr. Seselj, according to this paragraph 42, aided and\\nabetted the planning, preparation or execution, I executed this.  It\\nwasn\\'t that I only aided and abetted others, but I committed wanton\\n\\n\\n\\ndestruction and plunder of the public and private property of the Bosnian\\nMuslim, Bosnian Croat, and other non-Serb populations, and again all these\\nmunicipalities are listed here where I committed wanton looting of\\nproperty belonging to Muslims and Croats.\\nPlease tell us not only what you know about this but also on the\\nbasis of what you know what you know.\\nA.   This is sheer nonsense that you took part in any part of this in\\nany way.  However, such things did happen, looting and destruction of\\nprivate and public property.  Such things happened equally on all three\\nsides, because in a civil war it is far more difficult to keep everything\\nunder control as compared to a war waged against an external enemy.\\nWhat happened here was that a group of Serbs, Croats, or Muslims\\nwould loot houses, destroy property, et cetera -- or, rather, would have\\ntheir own property looted, and then they would seek property in a similar\\nway in other places.  This is something that was part of this war, and no\\nofficial authorities from Serbia could have done anything about that.  No\\none personally took part in this or aided, abetted, planned, executed,\\net cetera.\\nThere were paramilitary formations that had looting as their\\nprimary motive.  The Yellow Wasps did not only steal from Muslims but also\\nfrom Serbs.  They would stop an entire Serb family on a road.  People\\ntravelling from Republika Srpska to Serbia, for instance, they would seize\\ntheir car, they would seize what was in the car, et cetera.  There were\\nsuch cases as documented by the police of Republika Srpska, and this Trial\\nChamber can obtain information to that effect.  So there were cases of\\n\\n\\n\\nlooting, but spontaneously in a civil war which was waged in conditions\\nthat were rather chaotic.\\nThere was no organised looting and destruction by any authorities.\\nNot only the authorities of Serbia but also the authorities of Republika\\nSrpska or, rather, the top authorities of Republika Srpska.\\nQ.   In paragraph 43 it says that I, in concert with others, engaged in\\na military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping onto\\ncivilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population, killing and\\nwounding thousands of civilians of all ages and both sexes.\\nYou were in Sarajevo, as opposed to myself, so could you please\\nexplain whether the authorities of Republika Srpska and, in particular,\\ntell us what the authorities of Yugoslavia or Serbia or any organs of\\nYugoslavia and Serbia had to do with this.\\nA.   In the trial of General Galic, in the judgement there was a\\ndissenting opinion by Judge Navia.  In view of the length of the conflict\\nin Sarajevo, it was -- there were far less civilian casualties in terms of\\nthe duration of the war around Sarajevo than would have been the case\\nelsewhere in the world.  Civilians were being killed in Sarajevo, but on\\nboth sides when all this shelling was done.  But there were far less\\ncasualties than would be expected elsewhere in the world, and that is what\\nJudge Navia said in his dissenting opinion in the Galic judgement that I\\nread.\\nI was in Sarajevo several times during the war.  I witnessed the\\nkilling of Serb civilians, Serb children.  Sometimes they were targeted\\nintentionally and sometimes these killings were accidental.  But often the\\n\\n\\n\\nMuslims from their side killed their own civilians in order to present\\nthis in the media as Serb barbarism.  That was the Markale Marketplace,\\nVasa Miskin Street and a few other instances.  Nobody in Serbia did not\\ntake part in the war operations around Sarajevo in any way.  No official\\nfactors from Serbia, that is.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Did take part.  On the transcript it\\'s a double\\nnegative.\\nYes, Mr. --\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] There is a double negative in the\\nSerbian language and it does not change the meaning of the statement.  In\\nEnglish it might mean something different.  I\\'m sorry I don\\'t know English\\nand I cannot really adjust to this.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, Witness B024 says, and would you please confirm or\\ndeny this -- well, he says that he has no information that the JNA took\\npart in the attacks on Zvornik.  He said that on page 21201.  Can you\\nconfirm that?\\nA.   Well, the JNA did not attack Zvornik.\\nQ.   All right.  Thank you.\\nA.   In Zvornik the JNA clashed with Muslim paramilitary forces.  The\\nMuslim paramilitary forces attacked Zvornik while the JNA took part in the\\nliberation of Zvornik from Muslim paramilitary units.\\nQ.   Do you know anything about what (redacted) said in his\\nwitness statement?  That is on transcript page 20414.  That many Serbs,\\nincluding women and children, left Zvornik in April 1992.\\n\\n\\n\\nA.   Well, when there is a war in an urban area, in a town, it is only\\nlogical that civilians, primarily women, children, and the elderly flee\\nfrom war.  They\\'re fleeing from gunfire that comes from both sides.\\nVery often in this war and in any other war civilians would get\\nkilled by stray bullets.  So indeed Serb families were fleeing, too, from\\nthe conflict.\\nQ.   All right.  Well, as opposed to the Muslims who were expelled, the\\nSerbs were leaving of their own free will.  Is that the way it\\'s supposed\\nto seem?\\nA.   Regrettably that is the way the Western forces always portray\\nthis, that Serbs are genetic criminals and everybody else are their\\nvictims.  Even those who cause the war are victims of Serb violence.  We\\nare faced with an unscrupulous campaign of the Western powers that is\\nbased and anti-Serb grounds.\\nQ.   How can you explain this that for all these towns where killings\\nhappened, lootings, torchings, movement of the population, et cetera, all\\nof that can be found here in this indictment that I\\'ve been quoting to\\nyou, the entire civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  That is not an explanation for the witness to\\ngive.  Ask another question.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am putting a\\nquestion to you precisely because -- to him, rather, because I think that\\nhe can give an answer.  He\\'s a politician, an intellectual, a university\\nprofessor, quite aware of the situation, very familiar with the situation,\\nand he is in a position to give an answer to this question.\\n\\n\\n\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  And I\\'ve already ruled that he is not to answer\\nit.  So proceed.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   This same witness, (redacted), said that members of the\\nJNA in Zvornik guarded the bridges between the two sides.  Do you know\\nabout that?  This is on transcript page 20408.\\nA.   First of all, between the two sides there were no bridges.  The\\ntwo sides clashed within Zvornik itself.  The army tried to keep the\\nbridges under its own control and even more importantly the hydroelectric\\npower plant, so that Muslim paramilitary formation would not try to\\ndestroy the hydroelectric power plant.  In Zvornik there is an old\\nhydroelectric power plant and also an artificial lake.  The JNA fought the\\nparamilitaries from the Muslim side within the town of Zvornik.  The\\nconflict ended quickly, within a day or two.  I can\\'t say exactly, I\\nwasn\\'t there, but the Serb Radical Party had its volunteers there.  And\\nthen also the conflict was moved to the old Zvornik fort.\\nQ.   The same witness said that members of the paramilitary units\\ncommitted crimes in Zvornik.\\nA.   I cannot confirm or deny this.  There were some operations there\\nthat can be ascribed to paramilitary formations.  Crimes did occur, but\\nwho it was that committed them and where I cannot say.  Just like they are\\nascribing these crimes to you, they are ascribing them to me and to\\nKaradzic, but all of this unfounded, without a shred of evidence.\\nIn Belgrade there is a trial that is under way against a group of\\n\\n\\n\\npeople for crimes committed in the area of Zvornik.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  Next question.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Do you know anything about taking non-Serbs prisoner and torturing\\nthem, that is to say, people from Zvornik, from April to July 1992?  They\\nare mentioned in different statements and in different documents provided\\nby Mr. Nice.  The factory of standard, the bricklaying factory, Ekonomija,\\nDrinjaca, Celopek.  These are localities that are mentioned. Have you\\nheard anything about this and what do you know about it?\\nA.   To my knowledge there were crimes in Zvornik.  However, to my\\nknowledge the crimes were not committed while the JNA was operating but\\nonce the fighting was over.  Everyone of these crimes can be solved very\\nsimply, who the victims were and who the executors were.\\nQ.   Do you have any particular knowledge, for example about the\\ncultural centre in Drinjaca where, according to Witness B1455, many\\npersons were taken prisoner and there were different parapolice force\\nthere is?  Do you have any information about this?  If not, I\\'ll just go\\non.\\nA.   I cannot give you the names of the exact places where crimes were\\ncommitted.  There were crimes, to my knowledge, but it wasn\\'t the JNA that\\ntook part in it and the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party did not take\\npart in these crimes.  Who participated in this should be fully\\ninvestigated.  The protagonists are still alive and many immediate victims\\nare still alive, and they can testify about this.  The question is whether\\nthere was enough will to investigate this matter, and I\\'ve already\\n\\n\\n\\nreferred to the trial that is underway in Belgrade and I personally expect\\na great deal from that.\\nQ.   What about the cultural centre in Drinjaca?\\nA.   No, I don\\'t know anything about it.  I wasn\\'t there.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Seselj and Mr. Milosevic, you are not\\nobserving the pause between question and answer, and you are thereby\\ncreating difficulties for the interpreter.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, this is the first time\\nyou have warned us about this today.  As you see, Mr. Seselj and I are\\nbearing this in mind.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] We\\'re practising.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Witness B1780 mentioned on page 28220 that during his imprisonment\\nin this Ekonomija farm, among the people there there were members of your\\nunits.  To be sure, he also mentions the White Eagles and Arkan\\'s men.  Do\\nyou have any knowledge of this and is it possible that members of your\\nunits were there?  You\\'ve already explained you didn\\'t have any units of\\nyours, but is it possible that members of the JNA who were your volunteers\\nwere there?\\nA.   I\\'m not aware that the White Eagles were active in the Zvornik\\narea.  I know that Arkan\\'s Tigers were active there but to what extent and\\nin what locations I couldn\\'t say because I wasn\\'t there.\\nAll the volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in the JNA.  I\\ndo not doubt that this witness experienced all the sufferings and\\nmisfortunes he talked about, but evidently he\\'s very confused when\\n\\n\\n\\nidentifying the people who caused his sufferings.  He\\'s mixing up Seselj\\'s\\nmen, the White Eagles, Arkan\\'s men, and this shows that he\\'s very confused\\nand unable to identify the perpetrators.  I had said that the volunteers\\nof the Serb Radical Party did not participate in this, according to\\neverything I know, and my knowledge is very good.  I might even say very\\noften it\\'s beyond any doubt, impeccable, and it shouldn\\'t be easy to\\nestablish who actually perpetrated this.\\nQ.   He says that some of your men first tortured and then killed a\\ncertain Bego Bukvic in his presence, and this is on page 28221 of the\\ntranscript.  Do you know anything about this?\\nA.   I know of no instance where volunteers of the Serb Radical Party\\ncommitted any crimes in that place.\\nQ.   Well, do you have to know if they were volunteers of the Serb\\nRadical Party?\\nA.   Yes.  Because the people who on behalf of the Serb Radical Party\\nsent volunteers to the JNA would have forwarded this information to me ,\\nand as the competent command of the JNA would certainly have informed me\\nhad any of my volunteers done anything illegal.  I\\'m sure of it.\\nQ.   Would other volunteers have reported this?\\nA.   Yes.  They would have felt personally offended by such acts, and\\nthey would have asked for measures to be taken against such a volunteer,\\nbecause this would have inflicted huge moral damage to them.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Did you receive on a regular basis reports about\\nthe conducts of the volunteers?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I wouldn\\'t say the reports were\\n\\n\\n\\nregular, but they were exhaustive.  I personally took steps to find out\\nhow the fighting was proceeding and how the volunteers were behaving.  All\\nthe problems that I received reports about concerned less severe acts of\\nindiscipline, usually drunkenness.  And we would ask for such volunteers\\nto be removed from the units so that they would not upset the discipline\\nof the other men.\\nI was not informed of any serious crimes, and therefore I draw the\\nconclusion that none occurred.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Were these reports in writing?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  They were usually just oral\\nconversations.\\nI\\'m convinced that had serious crimes been committed, written\\nreports would have been sent to me.  I\\'m sure that the competent command\\nwould have told me had something like this happened.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, if you can\\'t recall it doesn\\'t matter, but is it true\\nthat in the indictment against you it says that around the 12th of May,\\n1992, Serbian forces, as it says there, including the leader of a group of\\nSeselj\\'s men beat up and killed a man called Dautovic?  Is this correct?\\nA.   Well, when they say a leader of a group of Seselj\\'s men, then\\nshould be easy to establish his first and last name and then I could tell\\nyou whether such a man existed or not.  It says here the leader of a group\\nof Seselj\\'s men but no mention is made of the name.  How do they know he\\'s\\nthe leader if they don\\'t know his name?  What does the term \"leader\" mean?\\n\\n\\n\\nWas he a squad leader, a company leader?  I have stressed several times\\nthat volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were never grouped together in\\nunits larger than a company.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Milosevic, where is that reference?\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj this because I\\nhave a note that this is mentioned in the indictment against him.  So I\\nwanted to ask him whether he recalls such an event as mentioned in the\\nindictment against him, because previously he answered that he knew of no\\nsuch instances, no crimes committed by volunteers of the Serb Radical\\nParty.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   As you have answered with precision that there were no such\\ninstances, I will not put any more questions to you about the various\\nallegations referring to the Zvornik area.  It would simply be a waste of\\ntime.\\nPlease tell us very briefly whether you have any knowledge about\\nthe events in Bosanski Samac in 1992, because it says that your men\\nparticipated in taking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\\nA.   First of all --\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Where is that reference?\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I quoted about half an hour ago, but\\nit wasn\\'t sufficiently clear.  I will try to find it again.  I\\'m simply\\ntrying to establish whether the witness knows anything about\\nBosanski Samac.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I have some knowledge but --\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  The answer -- the question I have is --  what do\\nyou mean by \"because it says,\" it says, \"that your men participated in\\ntaking Bosanski Samac in April 1992.\"  What is \"it\"?\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I asked Mr. Seselj something about\\nSamac before, but right now I can\\'t find it.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  I take it it\\'s not another reference to the\\nindictment against Mr. Seselj.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I don\\'t think it is.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have Bosanski Samac mentioned in\\nseveral places on your indictment, if I can be of assistance, and I can\\ntell you what I know about the events in Bosanski Samac.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Well, that\\'s the only reason I asked you whether you knew\\nanything.\\nA.   In paragraph 42 Bosanski Samac is ascribed to you.\\nQ.   Well, all the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are\\nascribed to me.  There aren\\'t any which are not ascribed to me.  But what\\ndo you know about the events there?\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t understand this question.  You\\ncan\\'t just ask a question, take a municipality and say, \"What do you know\\nabout events there?\"  There\\'s got to be some point to the question.\\nNow, what is this dealing with?\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Very well.  I won\\'t ask you anything about that, then, because I\\n\\n\\n\\ncan\\'t find the reference now.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, Mr. Milosevic.  If you find the\\nreference, you can come back to it, but bear in mind that you undertook to\\ncomplete the evidence in chief today.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I\\'m doing my best, Mr. Robinson, but\\nthere are many, many witnesses who mentioned Mr. Seselj, and I want to see\\nwhether there\\'s any truth in anything they said.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, you may -- Mr. Milosevic, you may have\\nother witnesses who may be in a better position to contradict the\\nassertions in the Prosecution case than Mr. Seselj himself.  Don\\'t assume\\nthat because a Prosecution says something about Mr. Seselj that he\\'s the\\nbest person to contradict it.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] So do many witnesses.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   On page 23520 of the transcript.  I\\'ll skip over the witness\\'s\\nname because I can\\'t recall at present whether or not he was protected,\\nMr. Robinson.  I don\\'t think he was, because I don\\'t have any note to that\\neffect, but he says:  \"In actions in Bosanski Samac, the Red Berets, the\\nWhite Wolves, and the JNA participated.\"\\nDo you know anything about this?\\nA.   I have rather reliable information about that.  First of all,\\nthere was a man whom I know as a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party from\\nEastern Slavonia and who is mentioned in several places, both in the\\nindictment against me and the judgement against the Samac group and so on.\\nHis name is Srecko Radovanovic.  He probably arrived there in a JNA\\n\\n\\n\\nhelicopter, which would mean he was part of the JNA.  However, he was\\naccompanied by a group of men who were not volunteers of the Serb Radical\\nParty, a certain man called Crni who was later a commander.  I know for\\nsure he was not a member of the Serb Radical Party.  There was also\\nSlobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, who had a fighting group known as\\nthe Grey Wolves, not the White Wolves, as far as I know.  This Lugar was\\ncharged with several crimes, and he was tried before the court in\\nBanja Luka.  At that time he was not a volunteer of the Serb Radical\\nParty.  In 1993 or 1994, he join the Serb Radical Party in Kragujevac and\\nthe party still has the original copy of his enrollment document.\\nQ.   Was that in Serbia?  Because the Judges don\\'t know that Kragujevac\\nis not in Bosnia.\\nA.   That\\'s correct.  And he joined in 1993 or 1994.  I\\'m getting ready\\nto obtain the original copy of his application to join, but he was\\nexpelled in 1995 for slapping the president of the Municipal Board, Jovan\\nSavic.  And he was in the Grey Wolves unit.  He had nothing to do with the\\nSerb Radical Party.  He was tried before a court in Banja Luka, and I gave\\nmy legal advisors instructions to get the entire transcript of this trial\\nand all the accompanying materials.\\nAs for Srecko Radovanovic, The Hague Prosecution has disclosed to\\nme certain documents which are public, and you can see that this man\\nRadovanovic entered into various private arrangements concerning his\\nparticipation in the war.  He was promised remuneration or received it.\\nThose are the facts I know about.  There was the JNA.  The members\\nof the JNA arrived in JNA helicopters.  Among them was a man who I know\\n\\n\\n\\nhad previously been a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, and they even\\ncalled him Chetnik duke, conferred upon him this title.  His name was\\nSrecko Radovanovic.\\nThere was Crni who was holding a command position, and he was\\ncertainly not a volunteer.  And Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, was\\ncertainly not a volunteer of the Serb Radical Party, because had he been\\nhe would not have about in the Grey Wolves.  As far as I can recall, that\\nunit was called the Grey Wolves.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Now let me try and tell you what I\\'ve understood\\nfrom that answer, if anything, that the JNA did participation in actions\\nin Bosanski Samac.  Is that a fair understanding of what you\\'ve said?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] As far as I know, the JNA was there,\\nyes.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  And that there was also a paramilitary group called\\nthe Grey Wolves active there?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it\\'s very problematic to say\\nparamilitary unit, because when one says paramilitary unit one means\\noutside the regular army.  This group was part of the Samac Territorial\\nDefence in some way, or part of the army of Republika Srpska.  I\\'m not\\nsure how, in what way.  But this Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar,\\nI think for a way was deputy battalion commander, and he was a very good\\nfighter.  He distinguished himself in the fighting.  However, what\\nhappened happened outside the battle.  I think the village was called\\nCrkvina or something like that.  I can\\'t recall it all off the top of my\\nhead, especially place names.  But he was tried before the court in\\n\\n\\n\\nBanja Luka, he and this group called the Grey Wolves.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  And the Red Berets you haven\\'t dealt with.  Did\\nthey participate?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] How can I respond to that?  What\\nRed Berets?  Were they soldiers wearing Red Berets on their heads?\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  That\\'s a perfectly legitimate answer for you to\\ngive, you see, because the question was in actions in Bosanski Samac the\\nRed Berets, the White Wolves and the JNA participated.  That was the\\nquotation.  And you gave us a long answer about Serb Radical volunteers,\\nwhich on the face of it, and as far as I can still tell, they\\'ve got\\nnothing to do with the question.  So all I\\'m doing now is trying to find\\nout what the real answer to that question is.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  We will adjourn for 20 minutes.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, it has nothing to do with the\\nRed Berets.\\n--- Recess taken at 5.25 p.m.\\n--- On resuming at 5.57 p.m.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  The reason for the late start is that the\\ntechnical person needed more time to make the redaction that was necessary\\nresulting from the inadvertent reference to the name of a protected\\nwitness.\\nYes, Mr. Milosevic.\\nTHE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  Microphone.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   You commented on the White Wolves or as you called them the Grey\\n\\n\\n\\nWolves and the Red Berets that were mentioned, that Mr. Bonomy also\\nmentioned.  Now, the witness, I don\\'t know whether he was protected or\\nnot, I don\\'t want to say his name, but anyway, on page 23520 of the\\ntranscript says that he saw 20 locals, and it\\'s about Samac, wearing\\nuniforms with Red Berets for which -- for whom he assumed -- he assumed\\nthey were locals who were trained in the Red Beret camp so they returned\\nto Samac.  Do you know anything about that?\\nA.   Well, I don\\'t have any information to that effect, and that is\\nquite impossible.  I\\'d like to point out once again that in different\\nplaces they called people Red Berets for the simple fact that they had\\nfound some Red Berets and put them on their heads.  So they could have\\nbeen various units, especially as we\\'re talking about locals in this\\nparticular case.  Where were they going?  Where were they trained?  What\\ndoes it all mean?  They might have received some Red Berets from some\\nwarehouse and would display them in Samac and then people thought they\\nwere some sort of Red Beret formation and wanted to link them up with the\\nRed Berets that were established in Serbia as a Special Purpose Unit of\\nthe State Security in 1996.\\nSo quite obviously there is the intent to mislead and this term\\napplies to different concepts.\\nQ.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  Now, is it correct that in March, and I\\nthink that is in the indictment against you but you\\'ll put me right if I\\'m\\nwrong, in March 1992 that you held a speech in Mali Zvornik, is that true,\\nthat is to say, on the territory of Serbia, the other side of Drina River,\\nwherein amongst others you said:  \"Dear brother Chetniks, especially you\\n\\n\\n\\nacross the Drina, you\\'re the bravest, and we\\'re going to clear up Bosnia\\nfrom the pagans and show them the road to the east where they belong.\"  Is\\nit true that you said that?\\nA.   This is partially a falsification of my actual statement and\\npartially it is a mistake made on the part of the Croatian translator,\\nbecause -- or interpreter, because Croatian translators don\\'t always know\\nthe Serbian language well enough, because they endeavour to speak an\\nartificial form of the distorted form of the Serbian language which the\\nCroats have been using for the last hundred years.  So in that Croatian\\nvariation \"pogan\" means \"pagan,\" where as in the Serb language \"pogan\"\\nmeans \"waste\" or \"faeces.\"  And I attacked the Islamic fundamentalists and\\npan-Islamists who wish to have Bosnia secede from Yugoslavia, and I called\\nthem \"pogani,\" which means faeces or waste.  But I did not refer to the\\nMuslims as pagans.  I am not -- I am an educated man.  I\\'m not a stupid\\nman.  For me to call a monotheistic religion a pagan religion, now, I have\\nnothing against the pagan traditions, and I look up to ancient Greece more\\nthan I do to all the Christians afterwards, let\\'s make that point clear,\\nbut I know that it is a monotheistic religion and one of the largest --\\ngreatest Serbian theologists Nikolaj Velimirevic, considered the Muslims\\nto be a Protestant variant of a Christianism, Christianity.\\nSo here because of inadequate translations, a monstrous assertion\\nis being made, far from any thoughts of mine.  What I did was to attack,\\nand I\\'ve been doing so for more than 20 years or 30 years, pan-Islamists,\\nIslamic fundamentalists, and I started attacking them first when they\\nfirst appeared in Bosnia-Herzegovina for that matter.\\n\\n\\n\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Where is a copy of this speech available?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Where you can find it.  Well, if you\\nhaven\\'t got if it in my books then the Prosecution probably has a copy\\nbecause most of my speeches were published in my books, in my works so, if\\na speech does not happen to be there, if --\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Was this one published in your books?  I apologise.\\nI haven\\'t read them all.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson [sic], two years ago I\\nhanded over to The Hague Tribunal 80 of my printed works.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Is this speech in any of them?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Most probably, but it would be up to\\nthe Prosecution to find it, not me.  I can\\'t look through that whole\\nmatter myself, because I didn\\'t make the statement only in one place.  I\\nmade the statement in several places, on several occasions.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Well, normally the party presenting the evidence is\\nresponsible for getting it to court in some -- as official as is possible,\\nbut you\\'re not aware of a copy of it being available for us as part of the\\npapers in connection with your evidence.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Bonomy, the side that has\\nreferred to my alleged speech is the Prosecution\\'s side.  So I\\'m just\\ntelling you where they made a mistake.  So they can find the original of\\nthe speech and present it here.  I can\\'t do the work of the Prosecution.\\nI can\\'t be expected to do that.  I am testifying to the facts and\\ncircumstances about which I have knowledge.  I\\'m not here to help the\\n\\n\\n\\nProsecution out in its work.  And for my part, I have contributed\\nsufficiently by handing over all my books.  They have far greater\\nresources than I do.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Nice, can you help?  Where do I locate the\\nevidence, readily locate the evidence in relation to this?\\nMR. NICE:  I\\'m not sure you can locate it readily at the moment\\nfrom our own database.  It may be possible.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  It appears Mr. Seselj is suggesting that there is\\nevidence of this speech led by the Prosecution in this case.\\nMR. NICE:  It may be in this case or it may be in the pre-trial\\nbrief of his own case.  I\\'ll deal with it as soon as I can.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  All right.  Thank you.\\nMR. NICE:  We can\\'t of course be guided in the way we are going to\\npresent our questions through his observations.  We\\'ll make our own\\ndecisions.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  No, no, no.  That\\'s nothing to the point.  I\\'m just\\ntrying to clarify where I can read this speech, but if no one\\'s going to\\nhelp me, that\\'s okay.\\nMR. NICE:  We certainly will help you when we can.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Witness B1643 who testified pursuant to 92 bis, I assume you know\\nthe written part, mentioned torture and capture of civilians in the SUP\\nbuilding of the Territorial Defence in the primary school and secondary\\nschool in Crkvina, the warehouse there.  Do you know anything about that?\\n\\n\\n\\nA.   Well, I already mentioned something about this.  I said that the\\nCrkvina case was probably processed in Banja Luka, which is where the Grey\\nWolves were investigated.  Slobodan Miljkovic, nicknamed Lugar, was\\narrested, but I don\\'t have any details about how the trial proceeded and\\nthe upshot.  I asked my legal advisors to find the complete dossier of\\nthat trial, but I do know for certain that he was arrested and taken to\\ntrial in Banja Luka, prosecuted in Banja Luka.\\nQ.   The indictment against you, in the indictment you are accused of\\nan act on the 7th of May, 1992, which allegedly happened there which says\\nthat two leaders of your group under your command killed 18 males at the\\nagricultural farm in Crkvina.  Is that the event you are referring to?\\nA.   Well, I assume so, although I was not in command.  I wasn\\'t there\\nnor did the Grey Wolves have anything to do with the Serbian Radical\\nParty.\\nQ.   That\\'s all I want to the hear from you, Mr. Seselj.  I think your\\nanswer suffices.\\nYou are also charged of an event on the 5th of July, 1992, when\\nallegedly members of units under your control, once again it is stated\\nkilled 22 civilians in Jesovo [phoen].  Do you know anything about that?\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, you now seem to be concentrating\\non the indictment against Mr. Seselj.  To what end?\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Seselj, Mr. Robinson, was\\nquoted as being one of the participants of the joint criminal enterprise.\\nSo it is up to us to assess how far there are grounds for posing this\\nquestion of a joint criminal enterprise and for attempting to prove that\\n\\n\\n\\nconcept here, and Mr. Seselj has an opportunity of telling us why he\\nstands accused, because he\\'s testifying here.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  The indictment against him is not necessarily\\nrelevant for that purpose.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Whatever you like.  I\\'m not going to\\ninsist upon that, although I do consider it to be relevant.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   You are also being accused of the fact that during the summer 1993\\nsome members of your alleged --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  [Previous translation continues] ... you have\\ncontinued.  I want you to stop that line of questioning, because I do not\\nsee at the moment its relevance.  It is not Mr. Seselj who is on trial\\nhere.  I know that he\\'s alleged to be a member of the joint criminal\\nenterprise.  I\\'m well aware of that.  But that doesn\\'t let in any and all\\nkind of allegations from the indictment relating to his trial.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Well, Mr. Robinson, if we can see\\nhere that the allegations against Mr. Seselj are not correct and not true,\\nthen that, once again, is proof and evidence that other things aren\\'t true\\neither, and he has refuted a number of witnesses\\' statements here that I\\nquoted.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  That\\'s a non sequitur, Mr. Milosevic, and I know\\nyou know that.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, witness William Thomas Francis Roy on page 28882 of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe transcript stated here that the Muslim snipers killed three pregnant\\nwomen and only then did the Serb snipers respond by opening fire.  Do you\\nknow anything about that event or generally speaking about events linked\\nto killings by snipers in the Sarajevo area?\\nA.   As far as I remember, that was the first instance of sniper fire\\nin Sarajevo, and we must bear in mind the fact that in Sarajevo the front\\nline stretched across the city itself.  The city was divided into a part\\nunder Muslim control and another part under Serb control.\\nNow, as far as sniper fire is concerned, one should bear in mind\\nthe following:  When you say sniper fire, you implied any fire coming from\\nrifles which wasn\\'t a sniper fire in the true sense of the word because\\nsniper fire is firing at a long distance, long range, with weapons with\\noptic sights.  However, that -- those kinds of weapons were rare on the\\nSerb side.  The Muslims, with the help of foreign powers, were able to\\ncome by much more sophisticated weapons, modern weapons, on the black\\nmarket.  I don\\'t exclude the possibility of individual cases there being\\nthe need for revenge and retaliation, but fire from Serb positions was\\nopened at army targets in Sarajevo because a war was being fought to gain\\ncontrol of the city, and the balance of forces was fairly equal.  The two\\nsides were fairly equal.  The front in Sarajevo, the distance, didn\\'t\\nchange for many years, and one or the other side would take control of\\ncertain sections, but there was death on both sides of the front line.\\nOn the Serb side of the front line there was no intentional\\nkilling of Muslim civilians under their control, whereas the Muslims\\nkilled about 4.000 Serb civilians near the cemetery and in other places,\\n\\n\\n\\nin Kazani and so on.\\nQ.   Thank you.  That same witness on the same page says that in the\\nSarajevo area both sides used snipers and that criminal acts were present\\non both sides.  Is that true?\\nA.   As far as crimes are concerned, criminal acts, I think that in\\nSarajevo there were the least number of criminal acts of this kind.  The\\nreal snipers were -- real snipers were mostly used on the Muslim side, far\\nmore than on the Serb side, because as I said, the Muslims had more\\nsophisticated and modern sniper weapons, whereas the Serbs had a more\\nfavourable geographic position for the deployment of their forces.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  I\\'m sorry, I\\'ve forgotten the evidence which I\\nthink there was earlier about your personal contact with Sarajevo.  How\\nmuch personal experience did you have of Sarajevo?  By that I mean the\\nconflict there.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I went to Sarajevo several times, to\\nthe Serb part of Sarajevo, the part of Sarajevo under Serb control that\\nis.  Most frequently I would go to Grbavica and tour the front line there.\\nAt Grbavica there were a considerable number of Muslims living there, and\\nI met some of them as well.  On one occasion I was there when a fresh\\nshipment of bread arrived, for example.  And I also met some of my\\ncolleagues from university and also people whom I\\'d been to school with,\\nMuslims.  And nobody complained about the conduct of the Serb forces.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Were you there when there were exchanges of fire\\ngoing on?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, while I was there, during my\\n\\n\\n\\nstay there, there was individual sporadic gunfire.  There was some\\ndangerous spots where you had to pass by quickly in your car and where you\\nhad to rush past because of sniper fire, the danger of sniper fire, but\\nthere were no more serious conflicts at that time.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Did you hear about the event of the 19th of October, 1993,\\nreferred to by this same witness, Thomas Francis Roy, in his testimony on\\npage 28884 of the transcript when the Bosnian Muslims dressed as Serbs\\nfired at the command of the United Nations for Bosnia-Herzegovina in\\nSarajevo?\\nA.   Yes.  That was a generally known event, and the Muslims would open\\nfire frequently and fire at international forces so that that could be\\nascribed to the Serbs, saying the Serbs had fired.  And then they abused\\nprotected facilities in order to open fire, and this would bring reaction\\nfrom the Serb side.  And very often from the main hospital in Sarajevo\\nthey would bring in mortars and other weapons.  They would open fire at\\nSerb positions, and then they would collect up the weapons, drive them off\\nin the boots of cars, and if the Serbs were to retaliate and open fire,\\nthen they would show the Serbs intention naturally aiming at\\nhospitals.  And there are a number of foreigners who testified to this,\\nwho were eyewitnesses, who saw the Muslims bringing in mortars to the\\nhospital compound and open fire on the Serb positions then withdraw\\nquickly, take away the mortars, and once the foreign controllers arrived\\nthey didn\\'t come across any Muslim weapons but they saw the Serbs opening\\n\\n\\n\\nfire in retaliation.\\nQ.   Witness Alija Gusalic in his testimony states that you visited\\nBijeljina before the conflict broke out, and that is to be found on 8 --\\npage 8258 of Alija Gusalic\\'s -- 18258, and I link this up with your\\nindictment and Alija Gusalic\\'s testimony saying that you visited Bijeljina\\nand members of the Serbian Radical Party to plan the attack and to\\ntakeover the Bijeljina.  May we have your comments to those assertions?\\nA.   That I visited Bijeljina several times before the war is quite\\ncorrect.  However, that I planned any kind of attack, that is just\\nnonsense.\\nQ.   Witness Alija Gusalic says that in the area of Bijeljina there\\nwere Arkan\\'s men and Seselj\\'s men based in Amajlije.  Do you know anything\\nabout that?\\nA.   I categorically assert that not a single volunteer of the Serb\\nRadical Party from Serbia was sent to Bijeljina.  I\\'m absolutely certain\\nof that.\\nQ.   The same witness says on page 18260, \"Seselj\\'s men had beards and\\ncockades.  Seselj was the boss and he instructed Mirko Blagojevic to\\ndistribute weapons to people from the Serb Radical Party.\"\\nA.   First of all, I was no boss.  Secondly, the volunteers of the Serb\\nRadical Party from time to time did have beards, but they were mostly\\nclean-shaven like me.  I never wore a beard in my life.  And that does not\\nbring into question my affiliation with the Chetniks, and a beard cannot\\nbe synonymous with Chetniks.  It was so in communist movies that for\\nideological reasons portrayed Chetniks that way, but quite simply that was\\n\\n\\n\\nnot a customary thing.  There were such examples.  Why not?   A soldier\\nhaving a beard is no exception in the world.  Secondly, I did not\\ndistribute any weapons, or did I hand them out, or did I have any role\\nin these struggles in Bijeljina at the beginning of the war.\\nMembers of the Serb Radical Party did participate in Bijeljina but\\nexclusively people who lived in Bijeljina anyway.\\nQ.   Thank you, Mr. Seselj.  On page 18277, Alija Gusalic says, and now\\nI\\'m asking you whether you know anything about this, that persons who were\\nnot Serbs were detained between April and September 1993, and they were\\nheld at the MUP building and at the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina.  Do you\\nknow anything about that?\\nA.   I don\\'t know about those particular localities, but I\\'ve already\\ntalked about Mauzer\\'s and Arkan\\'s conduct in Bijeljina, and it was for\\nthat reason that the local members of the Serb Radical Party often\\nattacked Mauzer in public and opposed him.\\nQ.   I\\'m sorry that I didn\\'t draw your attention to this on time,\\nMr. Seselj, but I put this question to you because in the indictment you\\nare being charged with the death of about 100 detainees at this camp in\\nBatkovic.\\nA.   I\\'ve already said that there were no volunteers of the Serb\\nRadical Party there.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  The question is not relevant.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, Alija Gusalic\\ntestified here, and he made those assertions here, and I\\'m linking that up\\nwith --\\n\\n\\n\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Put it on the basis that a Prosecution witness\\nmade the allegations here.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I already have.  The Batkovic camp\\nnear Bijeljina.  And I\\'ve linked that up to what the indictment against\\nMr. Seselj says.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, but that\\'s not relevant.  Move on.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] All right.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Are you saying that Alija Gusalic accused\\nMr. Seselj in this case, the present case, of causing the death of a\\nhundred detainees in the camp at Batkovic?\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] No.\\nJUDGE BONOMY:  Unless he did it in this case, it\\'s not relevant to\\nthis case.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  But Mr. Nice did that on the\\nbasis of that same assertion, because Gusalic here in this case talks\\nabout Batkovic and about people being detained there, whereas in\\nMr. Seselj\\'s indictment it says that 100 persons died due to inhumane\\ntreatment.  If that is not linked up well and fine, but why is it in\\nSeselj\\'s indictment?\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Proceed to another question, Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, Alija Gusalic on page 18278 confirmed that the\\nInternational Red Cross visited the Batkovic camp.  Do you know anything\\nabout this?  Was this camp supervised by the International Red Cross?\\nA.   I don\\'t know anything about the visit of the International Red\\n\\n\\n\\nCross.  At any rate, volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were not there.\\nAlso, local Serb radicals never took part in arrests or the detention of\\nprisoners of war or civilians or anyone else.  They absolutely did not\\ntake part in any such thing.\\nAs for the International Red Cross, if they did visit Batkovic and\\nif there was any such thing like the camp of Batkovic, then there would\\nhave to be a report, a report in writing compiled by them.\\nQ.   All right.  I\\'m not going to ask you about this anymore.  You\\nmentioned that some of your volunteers were within the JNA in Mostar.  Is\\nthat right?\\nA.   Yes.\\nQ.   Witness K2, in his testimony, mentioned some things about the\\nactivity of the Red Berets in Mostar.  Since you are familiar with the\\nsituation in Mostar and the presence of your volunteers in the JNA there,\\ndo you know anything about any activity of the Red Berets there?\\nA.   To my knowledge, in Mostar on the Serb side there were no\\nparamilitary formations.  Volunteers of the Serb Radical Party were in\\nMostar.  The JNA brought them there in their own vehicles from Belgrade,\\nfrom the barracks in Bubanj Potok.  All the members of the Serb Radical\\nParty were under the control of Momcilo Perisic, who publicly praised them\\nas highly disciplined on Belgrade television.\\nIf there were some soldiers wearing Red Berets, they could have\\nbeen members of some platoon of the military police, an intervention\\nplatoon, a reconnaissance platoon, something like that.  So I do not\\npreclude the possibility of some JNA soldiers wearing Red Berets, but this\\n\\n\\n\\nwas not a formation, a unit called the Red Berets.\\nQ.   Witness C17 says in his witness statement that at the Buna camp\\nthere were Seselj\\'s Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Red Berets;\\ntranscript page 22016.  Do you have any knowledge about that?\\nA.   That is absolutely impossible.  I\\'ve never heard of the White\\nEagles being in the territory of Mostar.  I haven\\'t heard of this Buna\\ncamp either.  It is not impossible that volunteers of the Serb Radical\\nParty, in accordance with orders issued by the command in charge, appeared\\nin Buna.  I don\\'t know anything about this, but there should be proper\\nrecords to that effect in JNA archives, but I never heard of the White\\nEagles appearing in the territory of Mostar or have I heard of any\\nRed Berets.\\nQ.   Witness K2 says on page 14578 that there were activities in\\nNevesinje.  Do you know anything about that?\\nA.   I was in Nevesinje but there was actually no fighting there.  I\\nwas in Nevesinje in 1991.  The fighting was in the territory of Mostar and\\nin the Neretva valley.\\nQ.   Was there any fighting in Nevesinje at any time during the war?\\nA.   As far as I know, there was no fighting during the war in\\nNevesinje.\\nQ.   That will do.\\nA.   When I was there in 1992, in Nevesinje, there was a considerable\\nnumber of Muslims as part of the local population.  There were no\\nconflicts.  Everything was peaceful.  Truth to tell, there was a large\\nnumber of refugees, Serb refugees, from the Neretva River valley, and they\\n\\n\\n\\nwere put up at various facilities there.\\nQ.   Do you know anything about a lake, Boracko Jezero, and a rest\\nhouse there where about 19 persons were killed, according to the\\nallegations made?\\nA.   I never knew anything about this.  And to my knowledge, volunteers\\nof the Serb Radical Party were not to Boracko Jezero.  That\\'s close to\\nKonjic.  I\\'ve already said that there were members of the Serb guard\\nthere.  Also, a Major Boro Antelj, a close associate of Vuk Draskovic was\\nthere, and we kept our distance from those areas where the Serb guard was\\noperating.\\nQ.   Did that Serb guard have anything to do with Arkan\\'s Serb\\nvolunteer guard?\\nA.   No.  These are two different paramilitary formations.\\nQ.   So what formation is this, the Serb guard?\\nA.   Of Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian Renewal Movement.  It appeared\\nelsewhere in Herzegovina, too, like Trebinje.  So the civilian authorities\\nhad a great deal of trouble with them driving them out of Trebinje because\\nthey stayed at the hotel and went out of Trebinje, went looting.  Then\\nthey appeared in Foca, caused problems there, and the authorities had a\\nlot of trouble getting rid of these guardsmen of Draskovic\\'s.  As far as I\\nknow, the Serb guard operated in those three places in Herzegovina.\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj --\\nA.   In Trebinje and in Foca when they appeared there, Branislav\\nLajnovic, Dugi, was their commander.\\nQ.   You mean the commander of this paramilitary formation?\\n\\n\\n\\nA.   The Serb guard.\\nQ.   Of Vuk Draskovic?\\nA.   Yes.  Otherwise a notorious criminal, a top-notch criminal from\\nNovi Sad, almost equal to Arkan.\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, last week we had here some submissions that you made\\nto the other side that have to do with Witness Dulovic.  I\\'ve forgotten\\nhis first name.\\nA.   Jovan.\\nQ.   Jovan Dulovic who testified here.  Mr. Robinson instructed me to\\nfind the original documents that can be linked up to your submissions\\nsince they refused to admit your submissions.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I am sorry, Mr. Robinson.  If you\\'re\\ntelling me to have copies made I will do that, but I\\'ve just received\\nthese copies.  This is a series of photocopies of articles written by\\nJovan Dulovic and published in Ekspres Politika from the 16th of November,\\nthe 26th of November, all of that in 1991.  Then the 18th of November, the\\n2nd of November.  So from November 1991.\\nIn these articles, he speaks very favourably of the JNA and\\ncommends their behaviour in the fighting around Vukovar.  For example, he\\nsays that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, Serbs and Croats, saw the light of\\nthe day after having stayed in cellars for many --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, what is the question?\\nMR. NICE:  And, Your Honour, if I may interrupt, if there\\'s going\\nto be a reference to and quotation from a newspaper article, it has to be\\non the overhead projector.  It then has to be available to us to read it\\n\\n\\n\\nin full should we wish to.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  That\\'s -- that\\'s the practice, Mr. Milosevic.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Very well.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, since I have only one copy of these articles and I\\'ve\\njust received that, could the usher please place them on the ELMO, and\\nthen you can have a look at least at some of the parts that have been\\nmarked.  Reference is made to Major Sljivancanin here, too, in a very\\nfavourable light.  Gratitude for assistance to civilians, Croats, at that,\\nand so on and so forth.  Please look at this series of articles.\\nIn order to answer my question, are these at least partly articles\\nthat you relied on when you wrote those submissions to the other side\\nabout the untruthful testimony of Jovan Dulovic or, rather, the difference\\nin -- between his reporting then and his testimony here about Vukovar?\\nMR. NICE:  Your Honour, that was a leading but nevertheless it\\'s\\ninteresting to see what the articles actually say.  And if it becomes\\nrelevant to consider their admissibility as evidence, I know the Chamber\\nwill have in mind its open recent ruling in respect of the documents of\\nJasovic and the potential evidential value or not as evidence of these\\ndocuments, but I\\'m most interested frankly in seeing what they actually\\nsay.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Let\\'s get it on the overhead projector.\\nThere appears to be a technical problem.  We\\'re not seeing\\nanything.\\nMr. Milosevic, the technician is being called.  He\\'s coming in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo move on to another question.  We\\'ll come back to this.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Robinson, I am sorry, but my\\nnext question also has to do with something that Mr. Seselj already\\ntestified about and the document that I obtained in the meantime and that\\nwould also have to be placed on the ELMO.  That is --\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Well, then move to the question after that,\\nbecause the overhead projector is not working.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] After that I have no further\\nquestions except -- since I wanted to finish today by all means, except\\nfor this other thing that I want to have placed on the ELMO, and that is a\\ndecision related to members of the group Spider.  Many statements were\\npresented here about them or, rather, what the spokesmen of the federal\\ngovernment said in February 2000 about the crime in Srebrenica.  So it was\\nknown who had committed it then, members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.\\nThe 13th of November, 2000, is the date of this decision.  So it is about\\n40 days after the coup d\\'etat of the 5th of October, 2000.  It was then\\nthat they were all released, set free.\\nSo wanted to show you this document, and I wanted to hand out\\ncopies to you.  I\\'ve just received this.  They are all in the Serbian\\nlanguage but they can be placed on the ELMO to show what the government\\nspokesman had said was completely disregarded, and these persons mentioned\\nin the criminal report against Erdemovic were set free.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  The ELMO is working now, Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, please take a look at this.  This is a series of\\n\\n\\n\\narticles from Ekspres Politika.  Can you see the date of the newspaper?\\nA.   It seems that this is the 16th of November or the 13th of\\nNovember.\\nQ.   1991; right?\\nA.   1991.\\nQ.   Unless this is a leading question.\\nA.   It\\'s illegible the date but I think it says November.  This is one\\nof the texts from Ekspres Politika that my legal advisors used when\\npreparing that submission of mine which is a special part of my defence.\\nThat is what I submitted to the OTP in accordance with the Rules of\\nEvidence and Procedure.\\nQ.   What does it say in the heading and what does it say in the\\nsubheading?\\nA.   It says above the title that 118 inhabitants of Vukovar, both\\nSerbs and Croats, saw the light of the day after having been in cellars\\nfor a long time.  \"Light finally,\" is the heading.  And then in the\\nsubheading:  \"Sniper shooters were silenced by Zoljas.\"  And then there\\'s\\nanother bit saying, \"In the darkness of cellars from the 25th of August,\"\\nand then Nada Juhas, obviously a Croat lady, stating, \"I cannot believe\\nthat we are alive,\" and obviously they appreciate that the JNA liberated\\nthe town of Vukovar from the Croat paramilitaries.\\nTHE INTERPRETER:  The speaker is overlapping so the beginning of\\nthe question was not heard by the interpreters.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute, please.  The interpreters have\\nindicated that you\\'re overlapping and so she did not hear the beginning of\\n\\n\\n\\nthe last question.  Repeat the question, Mr. Milosevic.\\nAnd please observe the pause, Mr. Seselj.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, please look at a few characteristic points here.\\nPerhaps it\\'s easier for you to see on the left-hand side where the text\\nis.\\nA.   For example, a characteristic point as Jovan Dulovic writes is as\\nfollows:  \"A river of people is flowing out of the huge cellars.  A total\\nof 118, both Serbs and Croats.  No one is asking about their ethnicity.\"\\nThat\\'s what Jovan Dulovic says, showing how the JNA treated Serbs and\\nCroats equally.  Civilians, that is.\\nI can\\'t read the first paragraph because it\\'s quite illegible, but\\nit seems to be describing medical assistance which was given immediately,\\nthat several ambulances were waiting to help.  \"It would not be a good\\nthing if the Ustasha attacked us with mortars just now.\"\\nSo Jovan Dulovic is writing about the liberation of one part of\\nVukovar before the fighting had stopped.\\nQ.   Can you see the subtitle which says \"The cruel major\"?\\nA.   Yes.\\nQ.   Will you look at the bottom of the column and tell us who this\\nrefers to and what it says about this cruel major.\\nA.   This is Major Sljivancanin, who treated these Croatian civilians\\nvery nicely.  And then Jovan Dulovic comments on his nice behaviour that\\nsurprised this Croat woman, and he says:  \"No knows what she as a Croat\\nheard about the cruelty of JNA soldiers.\"  So he\\'s describing the\\n\\n\\n\\nbehaviour of Major Sljivancanin as something quite the opposite of what\\nCroatian propaganda depicted, which characterised JNA soldiers in a very\\nbad way.\\nAnd then Major Sljivancanin says:  \"Whenever you need anything,\\nlook for me and I\\'ll help you.  Just ask for Sljivancanin.  I now have to\\ngo, the Major said and left.  He was followed by the gaze of mothers full\\nof gratitude.\"  This is somewhere near the end of the article.  \"He had\\nfollowed by the gaze of mothers and daughters full of gratitude.\"\\nAll this was written by Jovan Dulovic about the then Major now\\nColonel Veselin Sljivancanin.\\nQ.   Before that in this column where there is no photograph, Dulovic\\ndescribes how Sljivancanin sent a child to hospital.  He said, \"Take this\\nchild to hospital immediately.\"\\nA.   Yes, I see it.  Sljivancanin says, \"Take this child to the\\nhospital in Negoslavci right away,\" Major Sljivancanin ordered, showing\\nthe ambulance driver the wounded girl of Vlatka.  \"Let her be given\\nassistance and medicine.\"\\nA little later Vlatka\\'s mother, Verica, is anxiously looking for\\nher daughter in the crowd.  \"Where is my child?  What have they done to\\nher?  Where have they taken her,\" Verica was crying out.\\n\"Don\\'t be afraid.  She is in hospital,\" Sljivancanin said.  The\\nfrightened woman didn\\'t believe it.\"  This is followed by Dulovic\\'s\\ncomment:  \"Who knows what she as a Croat heard about the cruelty of JNA\\nsoldiers.\"\\nQ.   And what does it say then?\\n\\n\\n\\nA.   \"Get into my car.  I\\'ll take you to the hospital so you can see\\nyour child and reassure yourself that everything is all right.  They both\\nentered the vehicle.  In the meantime, the doctors have cleaned and\\ndressed Vlatka\\'s wound which was not life-threatening.  The mother and the\\ndaughter embraced while Sljivancanin stood next to them.\"\\nQ.   So this is Dulovic\\'s report from the Vukovar war theatre.\\nA.   Yes.\\nQ.   Look at the next page.  This is a newspaper article published on\\nthe following day.  So look at the titles and tell us what the main points\\nare.  This large title, this heading, that is.\\nA.   Yes.  Now it\\'s been adjusted.  Milka Vidovic is making a\\nstatement, \"I believed in the army.\"  And what\\'s in the subtitle.  \"A\\nlittle less than 90 days in a shelter deep below the Catholic cemetery in\\nVukovar.\"  And then there\\'s a quotation.\\nA.   \"We hoped our army would liberate us.  The expectations of the\\nguards members were not met, and a mass grave, a common grave near the\\nhospital.  This refers to the grave where the Croats buried Serb victims.\"\\nQ.   And look what it says in the article.\\nA.   In the article Dulovic describes what happened and says the\\nfollowing:  \"In the beginning of August, shooting started in Vukovar and\\nbarricades were set up.  Milka Vidovic from Borovo, Gacesina Street, house\\nnumber 26, with her husband Djuro, took shelter with their neighbours,\\nMilos Grudic, in a cellar together with the Grudic family.  A few days\\nlater, the members of the guards burst into the cellar.  These were\\nmembers of the Croatian National Guard Corps.  Get out or we\\'ll throw a\\n\\n\\n\\nbomb in.  The Chetniks are coming.  They\\'re cutting everyone\\'s throats.\\nWe\\'re taking you to a shelter.\"\\nQ.   It\\'s quite illegible.  Could you put some light on it?\\nLook at the passages marked in yellow.  You don\\'t have to read it\\nall out, just a few passages.\\nA.    \"Several of us -- or, rather, above us on the cemetery the guards\\nmembers were stationed.  Milka Vidovic said, \\'When they visited us in the\\ncellar, they said that the Chetniks were cutting everyone\\'s throats.  We\\nSerbs kept quiet.  We sensed that our people were getting close, and the\\nonly thing on our minds was whether we would ever get out of here.  I\\nbelieved in our army and I believed they would arrive.\\'\"\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  What\\'s the question in relation to this,\\nMr. Milosevic?\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, what is the signature marked in yellow here?\\nA.   Jovan Dulovic.  The same Jovan Dulovic who four or five years\\nlater changed his version by -- he turned around by 180 degrees because he\\nhas become a mercenary of the Western intelligence services, and he writes\\nfor the magazine Vreme which is the Belgrade branch of Western\\nintelligence agencies.\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, when you glanced through this article and you dealt\\nwith it in your submission, is there a single word here which does not\\nspeak favourably of the JNA and the people who fought in Vukovar?\\nA.   No.  The texts are all exceptionally favourable, full of praise\\nfor the soldiers and officers of the JNA during the fighting for Vukovar.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ.   Would you look at the next page, please.  Let\\'s just see what the\\ndate is.\\nA.   The 18th, I suppose.  The 18th of November.\\nQ.   Well, move on.  Move on.\\nA.   Mr. Milosevic, Dulovic says here one day with volunteers and tank\\ncrews in the street fighting for the liberation of Vukovar.  He praises\\nthe volunteers who participated in the fighting for Vukovar as part of the\\nJNA.  So this should be noted.\\nNext page, please.  I think that it\\'s very important to point this\\nout.\\nQ.   And the signature is Jovan Dulovic.  What\\'s the title of this\\narticle?\\nA.   The title of this article is \"The Knights of Vukovar.\"\\nQ.   And who does it refer to?\\nA.   The units of Major Borivoje Tesic on the front line in Vukovar.\\nMajor Borivoje Tesic I think -- says: \"I think this is the last stage of\\nthe fighting.  Crews carrying out their tasks successfully and the help of\\nbrave people is indispensable.\"  It speaks of Croatian Ustasha and so on.\\nQ.   Was this also written by Jovan Dulovic?\\nA.   Yes.\\nJUDGE KWON:  Just a second.  In previous page you said Mr. Dulovic\\nsaid volunteers as part of JNA.  Could you show us the passage where\\nMr. Dulovic said so?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] He says here:  \"One day with\\nvolunteers and tank crews in the street fighting for the liberation of\\n\\n\\n\\nVukovar.\"  This is above the headline.\\nThen he goes on to say:  \"Speaking favourably of Stanko Vujanovic,\\nhe says the commander of the 1st Company of the Territorial Defence of\\nVukovar who is said to be a man who knows no fear.\" It\\'s quite difficult\\nto read this.  My eyesight is not so good and this is not very legible.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Can it be enlarged?\\nA.   \"With his group of cleaners is making great progress, making\\nopenings in the walls just large enough for the fighters to squeeze\\nthrough and attack strongholds of the MUP and ZNG members.  The house in\\nwhich they stopped in Prugomijska [phoen] Street near the Brdo cafe is\\nunder constant fire by snipers whose positionings are very difficult to\\ndiscern.\"\\nJUDGE KWON:  Now, Mr. Seselj, I would like see to see the passage\\nwhich shows that they were part of JNA as you indicated.  Or was it your\\ncomment?\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.  Please.  In the entire text the\\nvolunteers are spoken of as members of the JNA.  We have passage here in\\nthe third column where it says it\\'s in the late afternoon and the fighting\\nis dying down.  The volunteers --\\nJUDGE KWON:  Could you use the pointer.  And you indicate on the\\nnewspaper on the ELMO, not your monitor.  Yes.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] \"It\\'s late in the afternoon and the\\nfighting is dying down.  The volunteers have pierced deep, and they have\\nconquered territory between the enemy forces.  The fighters will stay here\\n\\n\\n\\nuntil the morning.  There were no casualties today except for one soldier\\nwho was killed, and his name was Vignjevic.\"\\nHe then says:  \"We are going back while shells are flying over our\\nheads and Howitzer shells and so on.\"\\nThis whole text implies that the volunteers why part of the JNA.\\nMr. Kwon, you have here an order showing that these volunteers joined the\\n1st Guards Brigade.  The order was delivered to the OTP from Belgrade and\\nit\\'s beyond dispute.\\nIn the Vukovar, there were no troops outside the JNA.  There were\\nno paramilitary units.\\nJUDGE KWON:  It is your comment.  I really didn\\'t see any\\nconcrete -- the description these volunteers as part of JNA by\\nMr. Dulovic.\\nTHE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You have to read the whole text and\\neverything will become clear to you.\\nJUDGE KWON:  Proceed, Mr. Milosevic.\\nMR. MILOSEVIC: [Interpretation]\\nQ.   Look at the next page, please.  The following text or this one\\nagain says the Knights of Vukovar, Major Borivoje Tesic\\'s units on the\\nfront line, and this is a large article which seems not to be by Dulovic,\\nbut on the left-hand side there is a small one:  \"Brave commander falls,\\nBorovo Selo.\"  Would you look at the signature?  I believe it\\'s by\\nDulovic.  Could you scroll up?\\nA.   Yes.\\nQ.   What does it say in the passage marked by yellow?\\n\\n\\n\\nA.   The initials \"JD\" mean Jovan Dulovic.\\nQ.   And what does it say in this last passage?\\nA.   To the inhabitants of the Crepulje -- \"The inhabitants of the\\nCrepulje village have been mourning since yesterday.  Slavisa Milojevic,\\nwho with his volunteers, was the mainstay of the defence of this village\\nand one of the bravest and most popular people in this area enjoyed the\\nhighest respect among the defenders of the Serbian villages.\"\\nQ.   And he was killed?\\nA.   Yes.  Of course he deserves all this praise that Dulovic gives\\nhim.  Next page.\\nQ.   Is there anything else here by Dulovic?  Would you please have a\\nlook?  I haven\\'t had time to look at it all carefully.\\nA.   Yes.  There\\'s a big text.  I think the date is the 8th of\\nNovember.  \"Fierce artillery fighting in the operation to liberate\\nVukovar.\"\\nIn these texts he always talks of the fighting to liberate\\nVukovar, and five years later he\\'s saying something completely different.\\n\"Gunfire, hurricane, successful advance of the infantry in\\nVukovar, alarming messages by the guards members to Zagreb.\"  And then it\\nsays:  \"The army in the centre of Vukovar ready to fight back,\" and so on\\nand so forth.\\nSo this is yet another text that speaks very favourably of the\\nJNA.\\nQ.   And the signature is again Jovan Dulovic?  It\\'s been circled.\\nA.   Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ.   Very well.\\nA.   The 4th of November, 1991.  \"For two days fierce fighting has not\\nstopped on all approaches to Vukovar and in the town itself.  Streets in\\nflames.  The Vukovar-Borovo Naselje road has been cut off.  The village of\\nNjusta [phoen] under the control of the artillery of the JNA and the\\nTerritorial Defence.  Advances by Territorial Defence units and volunteers\\nfrom the direction of Trpinja stopped on the edge of Borovo Naselje.\"\\nHe then speaks of a Croatian mortar attack on Bobota [phoen] and\\nso on.\\nQ.   Is this another report by Dulovic?\\nA.   Yes, it\\'s signed by Jovan Dulovic.\\nQ.   Is there anything else, any other report?\\nA.   I\\'m looking at another text here but I can\\'t see whether it\\'s by\\nDulovic or not because it\\'s not signed.  It speaks of the Serbian\\nvolunteer guard but again a very favourable text.  I couldn\\'t see -- I\\ncan\\'t see the name of the author here.  I can\\'t see it on this page.\\nQ.   Is there anything else underneath, another report?\\nA.   \"Who are the volunteers,\" is the next title.\\nQ.   Well, I can\\'t see anything anymore.\\nA.   Yes.  How the volunteers, the territorials, the soldiers advanced\\nthrough the streets of Vukovar.  And then the title is \"Through the holes\\nto the Ustasha.  How come so many snipers, Croatian snipers, in Vukovar?\\nUnknown ammunition with inhumane bullets.\"\\nWhat happened in Vukovar was that the Croatian snipers used\\nweapons with subcalibre filling which would cause very serious wounds\\n\\n\\n\\nbecause the bullet would pass through the body and destroy the internal\\norgans.\\nQ.   Mr. Seselj, I can\\'t see what it says here in yellow, highlighted\\nin yellow.\\nA.   He speaks favourably about Captain Radic.  It\\'s Major Radic now\\nwho also stands accused in The Hague.  \"Throughout the month of October,\\nthe fighting went on in that street, says Captain Radic, who took part in\\nthe clashes on the front lines.  Every day the snipers would kill at least\\none person.  And so prominent volunteers were killed such as Luganja\\n[phoen], Rambo, Captain Trnovace and many others.  They were killed in\\nthat way.  Luganja for a moment appeared at window of a house they had\\ntaken control of but he was shot in the head straight away and he fell.\\nThe snipers often succeeded in keeping many streets under their own\\ncontrol and then a solution was found to move through the houses.\"\\nQ.   All right.  Now, who signed that?  Is that Jovan Dulovic\\'s article\\nagain?\\nA.   Well, it\\'s not legible but it is a series of articles by him.  We\\ncan\\'t find a signature here but quite obviously it is a series of articles\\nby him.\\nQ.   All right, Mr. Seselj.  Is that a series of articles to which you\\nreferred when you made the submissions to the opposite side with respect\\nto Dulovic\\'s testimony?\\nA.   Yes.  But this isn\\'t the complete material.  My legal advisors\\nfound many more texts of this kind and they quote them in extenso, and in\\nmy submission I state my intention to disclose them in keeping with\\n\\n\\n\\nRule 67 of the rules of evidence.\\nTHE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Mr. Seselj, I have one more question\\n[as interpreted] -- Robinson, I have a question for you.  As my associates\\nhave managed to come by a set of these or at least photocopies of the\\npapers from 1991 which Mr. Seselj refers to in his submission to the other\\nside, the presentation of these photocopies, is that sufficient grounds\\nfor my request that they be accepted as exhibits, that Mr. Seselj\\'s\\nsubmission be accepted as an exhibit?\\nMR. NICE:  Rather interesting issues, I think, arise on the\\nvalidity of these documents as exhibits, and it may be necessary to go\\nback and remind ourselves of what Mr. Dulovic himself said about these\\nmatters.  So I would respectfully invite the Chamber to put that matter\\nback.  But may we see the -- may we have access to this material tonight\\nin copy form in any event?  It may be we have them elsewhere, but it will\\nbe a difficult task to find them and it may in any event not be an\\nidentical collection.  I simply don\\'t know.\\nJUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Milosevic, we\\'ll have to consider the\\napplication that you\\'re making.  In the meantime, make -- have copies\\navailable to the Prosecution and to the assigned counsel and to the\\nChamber.\\nWe\\'ll have to adjourn now.  It\\'s 7.00.  We will resume tomorrow at\\n9.00 a.m.\\n--- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at 7.04 p.m.,\\nto be reconvened on Tuesday, the 6th day\\nof September, 2005, at 9.00 a.m. \\n\\n\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":97}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["f_write = open(\"data/example/cleanHtml.txt\", \"w\", encoding=\"utf8\")"],"metadata":{"id":"n7BNtxJ6NVdL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1668176708523,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":603,"user":{"displayName":"Isaac Olguín","userId":"09697151780329788960"}}},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["f_write.write(contentFileAux)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mxCEwvkIFJIC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1668176746005,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":293,"user":{"displayName":"Isaac Olguín","userId":"09697151780329788960"}},"outputId":"da6b0151-5e56-4398-cd6f-964b19b6d64d"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["154227"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["f_write.close()"],"metadata":{"id":"hm3YxL25FR1k","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1668176771156,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Isaac Olguín","userId":"09697151780329788960"}}},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[]}]}
