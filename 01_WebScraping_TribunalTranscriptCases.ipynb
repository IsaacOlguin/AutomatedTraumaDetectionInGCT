      "A.  It was a long hedge.\n",

      "noise is that?\n",

      "Q.  What do you remember about that occasion?\n",
      "A.  I remember clearly because that day on 20th a guard  had a birthday,\n",
      "he said.  On 20th July at half past 10 they came and took away Sadeta.\n",
      "Q.  Did you see where they were taken when they were taken from the\n",
      "restaurant building?\n",
      "A.  We rushed out, a couple of us, we went to the place where there was a\n",

      "while we still could get permission from the local SUP.  We had our\n",
      "meetings in public.  Anybody was admitted, whoever wanted to come.\n",
      "But later on things began to be more complex.  The SUP refused to give\n",
      "us permission to organise concerts, and they stopped permitting us to\n",

      "instructions how people should behave.\n",
      "Q.  What did the radio messages instruct Muslims to do?\n",
      "A.  Well, in the beginning they said we should merely stay partly in our\n",
      "houses, that nothing would happen. Then a little bit later on, perhaps\n",
      "after an hour or so, they said that all Muslims should put out white\n",
      "flags on their houses and if they did not have any flags, then perhaps\n",
      "bed linen, sheets or whatever.\n",
      "Q.  Did you do so?\n",
      "A.  Yes, we put out bed sheets on both sides of the  house.\n",
      "Q.  You say \"we put out bed sheets\", who was in Dr. Sadikovic's house with\n",
      "you?\n",

      "Q.  Then at some point after you and Mr. Kapetanovic had hung the white\n",
      "sheets in response to the instructions on the radio, did he observe\n",
      "something that caused him great concern?\n",
      "A.  Yes, at a certain point he went to the terrace on the upper floor and\n",
      "saw that his business premises were on fire.  It was a one-storeyed\n",
      "house on the ground floor, they had their business.  On the upper\n",
      "floor they had a flat.  I heard him scream.  I asked him what was it\n",
      "and he said that his mother was in that flat upstairs, and that the\n",
      "flat was on fire, and I ran out.  I could see the flames, perhaps as\n",
      "much as 20 metres high.  The house was ablaze.  It was literally all\n",
      "burning.\n",
      "Perhaps it took him some time to calm down, and he decided then to\n",
      "go and see what had happened to his mother.  At that point I did not\n",
      "know what to do.  So I decided to go with him.  I could not really\n",
      "leave him to himself, because for the past few days he was suffering\n",
      "from kidneys and that was why he was in Eso's house, to treat his\n",
      "kidneys, and he could not, of course, go to the hospital because the\n",
      "hospital had already been taken over by the Serbs.\n",
      "Q.  While you were outside were you confronted at some point by a Serb\n",
      "soldier and did you flee that soldier and run into the nearest Muslim\n",
      "house?\n",
      "A.  Yes.  The soldier came up and said, \"Halt\".  We were  some 50 metres\n",
      "away and I automatically said, \"Asif, I am not going to wait for him,\n",
      "I am fleeing\", and there was the wire of the house nearby -- there was\n",
      "a hedge of the house nearby and I jumped over that hedge, and then I\n",
      "heard three or four bursts of fire, but I was in the luck, I was not\n",
      "hit.\n",
      "Then I crawled behind that house to another house. I used to know\n",
      "people who lived around there.  I knew it was a Muslim house.  I\n",
      "knocked on the door and was flabbergasted when I saw another friend of\n",
      "mine, Saim Mesanovic who opened the door for me and let me in even\n",
      "though he was from a different part of the town, and that was his\n",
      "relative's house.\n",
      "Q.  While you were in that house was there another announcement on the\n",
      "radio that Muslims should put white ribbons or arm bands on their\n",
      "arms, form columns and go to the main square?\n",
      "A.  Yes, they said that all Muslims from that part of the town should come\n",
      "out and head for the town with white arm bands.\n",
      "Q.  Did you and the other persons in the house do that?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  Once outside were you directed by Serb forces toward the area of the\n",
      "taller buildings in the town centre?\n",
      "A.  Yes, they directed us in the direction of the small marketplace.  Then\n",
      "by Muharem Rujanovic Street, there were three skyscrapers in Prijedor\n",
      "and that is where they stopped, they directed us.  There was a column\n",
      "of perhaps 1,000 to 2,000 people.  I would not know exactly.\n",
      "Q.  On the way did you see any corpses?\n",
      "A.  Yes, in the marketplace I went round a pile in which there were some\n",
      "four or five bodies, and then I happened to glance over the area of\n",
      "the marketplace and I saw another body lying there, and then I could\n",
      "not stand it any longer and I turned my head away.\n",
      "Q.  Were those bodies of civilians?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  When you reached the area they directed you to, were there buses\n",
      "waiting?\n",
      "A.  Well, the buses were already there, parked.\n",
      "Q.  Did Serb forces then begin to separate the men from women and\n",
      "children?\n",
      "A.  Yes, they said that men over the age of 15 should stand, should move\n",
      "to one side, and children below the age of 15 and women should go to\n",
      "the other side.\n",
      "Q.  Did you board one of those buses?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  Where were you first taken?\n",
      "A.  Well, first they took us to the SUP and that is where the buses\n",
      "stopped, by the SUP.\n",
      "Q.  So first to the police station in Prijedor town?\n",
      "A.  To the police station in Prijedor.\n",
      "Q.  How long did the bus remain there?\n",
      "A.  Not long, some 10 minutes or so, five or 10 minutes.\n",
      "Q.  Were there guards on your bus?\n",
      "A.  Yes, there were two or three perhaps.  I remember that one had got off\n",
      "and entered the SUP building, probably to get instructions, and\n",
      "returned after a couple of minutes, and the bus continued.\n",
      "Q.  I have been referring to your bus.  Were there other  buses loaded\n",

      "of the League for Peace were obstructed by the authorities in\n",

      "Q.  Mr. Beganovic, how would you describe the general conditions of\n",
      "Omarska camp?\n",
      "A.  The general conditions are indescribable.  I have no words to describe\n",
      "it.  I do not know how to tell this to the honoured courtroom.  Every\n",
      "minute we were upset, we were beaten, psychologically abused, starved,\n",
      "left without drink, without drinking, drinks -- simply it is\n",
      "impossible to describe.\n",
      "Q.  When would beatings of prisoners occur?  During what sorts of\n",
      "activities by prisoners?\n",
      "A.  The worst was during the day they interrogated inmates in this\n",
      "building upstairs from the restaurant. 99 per cent of the people came\n",
      "back beaten up, and the nights were even more horrible.  After their\n",
      "hours, work hours, at 5 o'clock they stopped interrogating.  Then\n",
      "there were private visits by Serbian soldiers, guards, civilians.\n",
      "Whoever wanted to go there, go in, did so and looked for inmates,\n",
      "calling their names, surnames or nicknames.  We were even taken by\n",
      "people who had never met us before.  We lay down on our stomachs in\n",
      "the pista.  They would simply come, \"Give me two, give me three\",\n",
      "\"Here, take five, if you like\".  Simply, people were lying on their\n",
      "stomachs.  Someone comes and kicks you, \"Stand up, stand up, you and\n",
      "you and you\".  I do not  know that anyone came back, any of those\n",
      "people came back.\n",

      "A.  About 10 years.\n",
      "Q.  How did you happen to know him?\n",

      "him to the area where I had my restaurant.  He was known to create\n",
      "conflicts.  He used to come with his karate people, so-called karate\n",
      "people. They were usually beaten in Prijedor when they came, but still\n",

      "A.  No.\n",
      "Q.  Did you later find out who he was?\n",

      "Q.  What nationality was Dragan?\n",
      "A.  I heard in the camp that he was a Serb.\n",

      "take you to see someone whom you did know?\n",
      "A.  Yes, he took me out at this semicircle.  Nikica Janjic was standing\n",
      "there.\n",
      "Q.  Had you had a conflict of some sort with Nikica Janjic before the war?\n",
      "A.  Yes, about a year and a half before the outbreak of the war, I had a\n",
      "confrontation, I had a physical conflict with him.\n",
      "Q.  Did that occur on an evening when you broke up a fight between Janjic\n",
      "and his girlfriend and then later intervened when he attacked one of\n",
      "your employees?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  What did Janjic tell you when you were brought to him?\n",
      "A.  He said, \"See how times have changed?  Tonight I am going to cut your\n",
      "throat\".\n",
      "Q.  After that did they bring you back to the restaurant building for a\n",
      "short time?\n",
      "A.  Yes, they did bring me back for about half an hour.\n",
      "Q.  Then were you called out again?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  Where were you taken?\n",
      "A.  I did not hear the question.  They took me to the pista.  At the exit\n",
      "of the building Dragan started beating me with the baton on the head,\n",
      "on the neck, on the back, the upper part of my back.  He kept hitting\n",
      "me in that area as we went to the white house.\n",
      "Q.  You were taken to the white house?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",

      "approximately the same time?\n",
      "A.  Yes, I saw that I was followed by Terzic Sefik, Sefik Terzic, a\n",
      "well-known hairdresser from Prijedor, nicknamed \"Kiki\".  Then they\n",
      "called out Asaf after me.  Asaf was in the same restaurant where I\n",
      "was.  Then Rezak Hukanovic, nicknamed \"Dzigi\", the three of them and\n",
      "myself.\n",
      "Q.  What was Rezak Hukanovic's occupation?\n",

      "Q.  Is it fair to say that all three of these men were well-known and\n",
      "successful people in Prijedor?\n",
      "A.  Yes, they were very well-known and successful.\n",
      "Q.  Were all three men Muslims?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  Where were you placed when you were taken to the white house?\n",
      "A.  I was placed in the second room on the right.  The other three were\n",
      "placed in the second room to the left, as far as I could assess.\n",
      "Q.  What happened when you were taken to the second room on the right?\n",
      "A.  They started beating me immediately, and Dragan and Nikica were the\n",
      "only people there with me.  The other Serbian soldiers were on the\n",
      "other side where the other three were.\n",
      "Q.  What did Dragan and Nikica do to you in the white house?\n",
      "A.  They beat me, both of them.  Dragan was hitting me with a baton.\n",
      "Nikica kicked me.  I do not remember whether he used an object,\n",
      "whether he used an object to hit me, but he mostly kicked me.  I tried\n",
      "to protect myself as much as I could using my hands, but occasionally\n",
      "I saw people coming from the other room.  It was Saponja, the handball\n",
      "player from Prijedor.  He used to be my friend.  His parents, their\n",
      "wedding took place in my house, because they had just moved to\n",
      "Prijedor, they had not found a dwelling place yet.  So his father and\n",
      "my father were very good friends.  His mother borrowed my mother's\n",
      "dress to get married in.\n",
      "Others came in too, there was also the well-known murderer from\n",
      "before the war Zigic and then Duca, Dusko Knezevic.  They came in from\n",
      "time to time carrying various objects.  They also had some cables,\n",
      "electric cables, and with a ball on top of it welded on to the  cable.\n",
      "I do not know how they made those devices, but they used these --\n",
      "used everything that was available to beat us.  But in this beating\n",
      "Dragan and Nikica were the main individuals who beat us, the others\n",
      "just came in from time to time to beat us.\n",
      "Q.  How long did the beating continue?\n",
      "A.  It was an eternity, as far as I was concerned, but maybe about half an\n",
      "hour.\n",
      "Q.  At some point did they order you to lie down on the ground, on the\n",
      "floor?\n",
      "A.  Yes.  Dragan ordered me to lie down, to stretch out my arms, with my\n",
      "stomach facing the floor, but we knew, the inmates knew, that in many\n",
      "cases their spines were broken.  I tried to resist not to lie down.  I\n",
      "told them to kill me.  I said I did not want to lie down. I refused to\n",
      "lie down.\n",
      "Q.  What happened after that?\n",
      "A.  At one point there was something like a desk and a chair.  I do not\n",
      "know how I found myself on that chair. As far as I remember, my left\n",
      "arm, my left arm was on the desk and at one point Nikica took out a\n",
      "knife about this size.  I thought, because he had told me that he\n",
      "would cut my throat, that he had taken the knife in order to cut my\n",
      "throat.  Almost automatically I started to lift my arm and I felt at\n",
      "that moment that a knife stabbed my hand and I still had still have\n",
      "the scar.\n",
      "The blood spurred out of the wound, spurted.  At that point I lost\n",
      "consciousness and then I know that they took me out of that room.  At\n",
      "that point the other three friends of mine were coming out of the\n",
      "other room and  they took us out, out of the white house.\n",
      "Q.  While you were being beaten, could you tell what was happening to the\n",
      "other prisoners who had been called out?\n",
      "A.  We just heard screams and moans.  I was not interested in others.  I\n",
      "was in such a bad condition that I was not able to worry about others\n",
      "because my own life was at risk.\n",
      "Q.  After the beating were you held in the white house?\n",
      "A.  They took us out and led us towards the pista, and at one point Zigic\n",
      "said, told us to bend down and to drink the water next to the kerb\n",
      "like dogs, and that we should behave like dogs and drink the water\n",
      "like dogs.  We drank the water which we were glad to do because my\n",
      "throat was dry.  At that moment those bad words had no meaning to me.\n",
      "Q.  After that were you returned to stay in the pista or were you taken\n",
      "back to the white house?\n",
      "A.  After that the three of them were taken towards the pista, the\n",
      "restaurant.  I was ordered by Dragan to go back to the white house.\n",
      "He started hitting me again on the way to the white house.  He hit me\n",
      "a couple of times and then he threw me into the first room to the\n",
      "left.\n",
      "Q.  Did you stay there for that night and the following night?\n",
      "A.  No, I stayed there that night until about 10.00 or 11.00 in the\n",
      "morning.  Then they returned us, a whole group of us -- there were\n",
      "about 150 or 200 in the group  -- to spend the night in the white\n",
      "house.\n",
      "Q.  During the time you were in the white house did a guard see you and\n",
      "comment on your condition?\n",
      "A.  When I entered that room I saw there were about 10 or 12 young men in\n",
      "civilian clothes.  We knew already that the room was assigned for\n",
      "so-called Muslim extremists who had attacked Prijedor, and we also\n",
      "knew that nobody would come alive out of that room.\n",
      "In the evening, about 8 or 9 o'clock, maybe 10.00, I cannot quite\n",
      "remember, a guard came up to the window. Slavko Ecimovic was there in\n",
      "prison, my friend from school and from childhood.  He told him at one\n",
      "moment,  \"You say you did not attack Prijedor, look, look in your\n",
      "group, there is even a black man\", and he had a flash light on and I\n",
      "knew that it was trained at me.  As far as I could move, because my\n",
      "pain was horrible, I said, \"I am not a black man.  I have been here\n",
      "for 12 days in the pista.  I was on the pista mostly and they came\n",
      "privately and beat me up\".  The man remained breathless and said, \"Is\n",
      "it possible?\"  He went around through the door.  He crouched next to\n",
      "me.  He again directed his flash light at me.  He said, \"Mother\n",
      "fuckers, is it possible to beat up a man like they beat you up?\"\n",
      "I saw that he was speaking, that he was honest about it.  I said, I\n",
      "asked him if he could help me to be transferred to the pista, to the\n",
      "group that I belonged to because my life was at risk where I was, that\n",
      "those young men had come after me and I have no connection with them.\n",
      "He said that at that moment he could not promise anything, but he\n",
      "would try to transfer me, which he did.\n",
      "He came the following morning about 8.00 or 9.00 and visited me.  I\n",
      "think his name was a Radenko.  He left.  He said he did not know\n",
      "nothing, he could not tell  me anything that is concrete.  So he came\n",
      "about 10.00, at 11 o'clock in the morning, he took me out and led me\n",
      "to the hangar.  There were some wash basins there.  He told me to\n",
      "wash.  There was a mirror there and then everything became clear to\n",
      "me.  I looked at myself in the mirror and I saw what I looked like.\n",
      "Q.  Mr. Beganovic, what was the condition of the other prisoners in the\n",
      "white house?\n",
      "A.  Horrible, incredible, very similar to mine.  There may have been worse\n",
      "cases than me.  People could not move mostly.  There were people who\n",
      "could not move a single centimetre without a moan.\n",
      "Q.  How long after you were transferred to room 15 was it before the\n",
      "second beating occurred?\n",
      "A.  Maybe two days.\n",
      "Q.  Who called you out on that occasion?\n",
      "A.  Nikica Janjic.\n",
      "Q.  Where were you at the time?\n",
      "A.  That day they took us out of room No. 15, all of us, because of a list\n",
      "that they were about to make.  They were making some lists.  We were\n",
      "on the lawn between the white house and the red house.\n",
      "Q.  Where did Janjic take you?\n",
      "A.  To the white house.\n",
      "Q.  Was there any other Serb there?\n",
      "A.  Yes, there was a guard Commander, Kvocka, and a guard.  I know his\n",
      "nickname was Ckalja.\n",
      "Q.  Did you see any other Serbs there?\n",
      "A.  There were always guards.  They were just hanging around.  We were not\n",
      "particularly interested to observe  them.\n",
      "Q.  Was there any other Serb in the white house when Janjic took you\n",
      "there?\n",
      "A.  I was promised safety by Ckalja.  It was really just a formality so\n",
      "that I could be dragged into the white house, because I said, \"This is\n",
      "what they have done to me.  The man wants to cut my throat\".  He says,\n",
      "\"I guarantee your safety.  Go in and have a word with him\".  So I\n",
      "knew that I had to go in, so I did.\n",
      "A small, skinny soldier, about 160 metres tall, with a jacket\n",
      "remained at the doorway with a bag, with a big bag on his back.  It\n",
      "looked funny with an automatic rifle, and Nikica started beating me at\n",
      "the same moment. The other man was standing at the door to prevent me\n",
      "from fleeing.\n",
      "Q.  How did Nikica Janjic beat you in the white house on that occasion?\n",
      "A.  At first he kicked me with his feet, then beat me with hands.  Then he\n",
      "took out his Colt pistol, and I always remembered what he told me, and\n",
      "began to beat me with the pistol handle on the head.  My head was all\n",
      "swollen already, but he went on hitting me with that pistol and made\n",
      "holes in my head.  Perhaps it was a good for me because the blood had\n",
      "already coagulated and was all so swollen, and perhaps all this\n",
      "coagulated blood then came out from the body through those wounds he\n",
      "inflicted at that moment.  So perhaps that is how I can explain that\n",
      "my skull did not burst.\n",
      "Q.  How long did that beating continue for?\n",
      "A.  It went on for a long time, 20 minutes perhaps.  He  was already\n",
      "tired.  He was sweating.  His shirt was wet with sweat and he was\n",
      "sweating all over.  He was quite a big guy.  So that at one point he\n",
      "stopped beating me. I asked him to listen to me, to bear up with me\n",
      "for a couple of minutes and then, if he wanted to, he could go on\n",
      "beating me or just do me any or, at any rate, finish with me.  To my\n",
      "surprise, he agreed to talk to me.\n",
      "Q.  What did you tell him or what did he tell you during that discussion?\n",
      "A.  Well, I told him as regards that conflict that we had before, and that\n",
      "I assumed the responsibility for it, yes, I had hit him, but now what\n",
      "he had done on those two occasions I thought that was a sufficient tit\n",
      "for tat and that I did not hold any grudges against him, not too much,\n",
      "and that he should either kill me or let me be, and to make his\n",
      "choice, to do what he wanted but, at any rate, to finish somehow with\n",
      "me.\n",
      "So he thought for a while and said, \"I will let you live.  I will\n",
      "not kill you\".  After that he started talking with me more and more.\n",
      "I could not speak any more.  I remember as I asked him to take me out,\n",
      "but then he sent one of those lads who was standing with the automatic\n",
      "in the doorway to go and bring some water.  He did, and let me drink\n",
      "water.\n",
      "I washed a little, that is, washed the blood off my face.  He said\n",
      "thank my mother because she told me not to kill you.  She made me\n",
      "swear that I would not kill you because you are an only son and she\n",
      "had an only son, and she advised him in this way.  Perhaps this had\n",
      "taken the upper hand, this prevailed, and he did not kill me and he\n",
      "kept his word and did not come again.\n",
      "Q.  After that did you continue to be held in room 15 and were you in room\n",
      "15 when the third beating occurred?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  How long after this second beating was it before the third beating\n",
      "took place?\n",
      "A.  Well, that too about two days.\n",
      "Q.  About what time was it when you were called out?\n",
      "A.  It was late in the afternoon, maybe, around 6 o'clock.\n",
      "Q.  Did you see who called you out or just hear a voice?\n",
      "A.  I only heard a voice.\n",
      "Q.  Where was the voice coming from?\n",
      "A.  The voice came from the entrance, from the door of room No. 15.\n",
      "Q.  After being called out did you leave the room?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  When you did what did you see?\n",
      "A.  I saw somewhere in the middle, halfway up the stairs Dragan standing.\n",
      "Q.  Mr. Beganovic, in a moment I am going to ask you to get up from the\n",
      "chair and point out on the model -- if you can wait just a moment I\n",
      "will have the roofs removed  -- where you were when you were called\n",
      "out, where room 15 was.  If the roofs could be removed from the\n",
      "models? Both roofs of the big building?\n",
      "Mr. Beganovic, I do not know if the cameras will be able to pick\n",
      "this up, but you will be able to read the numbers.  If you can walk\n",
      "over to the model and both point what room you were in and then tell\n",
      "us what numbers  are written there.  You can remove your headphones\n",
      "for that and then return to your seat.  Can you point to room 15, the\n",
      "area that comprised room 15?\n",
      "A.  (The witness indicated on the model).\n",
      "Q.  Are the numbers written on the floor of the area which comprised room\n",
      "15?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  Speaking loudly, can you tell us what those numbers are?\n",
      "A.  B7, 23.\n",
      "THE INTERPRETER:  We can barely hear the witness.  I am sorry.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Mr. Beganovic, if you can remember the numbers and turn to\n",
      "the microphone immediately behind you, the interpreters will be able\n",
      "to pick up what you are saying.\n",
      "A.  Repeat the numbers?\n",
      "Q.  Yes, can you repeat the numbers that are shown in room 15?\n",
      "A.  B23, B8, and three times B7.\n",
      "Q.  As you are looking at the model now, which way did you go to leave\n",
      "room 15?\n",
      "A.  I was lying in this corner, then here, here were the wash basins and I\n",
      "came out of this door.\n",
      "Q.  All right, and then went down the stairs?\n",
      "A.  Down the stairs.\n",
      "Q.  You can take your seat again, Mr. Beganovic.  Thank you.  Mr.\n",
      "Beganovic, you said you saw Dragan; is that the same Dragan who had\n",
      "been involved in beating you before?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  How was he dressed on this occasion?\n",
      "A.  The same.\n",
      "Q.  Again the military uniform with the white belt?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  Did he say anything to you?\n",
      "A.  During those beatings when I was put in that room, one of the\n",
      "detainees had bandaged my head with some white cloth.  I do not know\n",
      "what it was, a t-shirt or a shirt but, at any rate, it was a white rag\n",
      "to stop the bleeding, and that cloth had stuck to my head and just\n",
      "stayed there.  I did not even try to remove it because it had all\n",
      "hardened already with the blood.  So that I came out with this to face\n",
      "him, and he said, \"What do you need that on your head for?  You are\n",
      "not a Hodza, you sell flowers\", and I had nothing to tell him in\n",
      "response.  He told me to come down.\n",
      "Q.  When he said, \"You are not a Hodza, he was mocking the bandage on your\n",
      "head as if it was a turban?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  When you went down the steps what happened?\n",
      "A.  The moment I came down the stairs he started beating me, I think with\n",
      "a baton again.\n",
      "Q.  Did he push you or direct you to any particular part of the hangar\n",
      "building?\n",
      "A.  He directed me towards the hangar, towards the inside of the hangar.\n",
      "Q.  That would be the ground floor of the hangar?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  Were other Serbs there waiting?\n",
      "A.  There was a group of soldiers wearing different kinds  of clothes, but\n",
      "they were all military uniforms.\n",
      "Q.  Approximately, how many in this group?\n",
      "A.  Well, I should say seven to 10.\n",
      "Q.  Was Dule Tadic a member of this group?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  When you got to the group what did they do?\n",
      "A.  Well, I burst in among them and they simply at the same time started\n",
      "beating me as usual, beating with different objects, mostly with the\n",
      "feet, boots, those soldiers boots, also some sticks, some metal rods,\n",
      "some metal cables, with all sorts of things.\n",
      "Q.  Was Dule Tadic one of those actively involved in hitting and kicking\n",
      "you?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  Do you remember what he was wearing on that occasion?\n",
      "A.  He had the multi-coloured military uniform.\n",
      "Q.  Do you remember whether he was clean shaven or had a beard?\n",
      "A.  Well, he looked unkempt, like all of them rather unkempt, untidy a\n",
      "beard very untidy.  He did not have a real beard.\n",
      "Q.  But he had some days growth of beard?\n",
      "A.  Yes.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  How long did the beating continue?\n",
      "A.  It went on between 20 minutes and half an hour.\n",
      "Q.  Did you lose consciousness during the beating?\n",
      "A.  In the hangar on the ground floor, no.  I did upstairs when it was all\n",
      "over and when I went up.\n",
      "Q.  Did you attempt to remain conscious during the beating for a\n",
      "particular reason?\n",
      "A.  Yes, because I realised that if I fainted I would never wake up again\n",
      "because they simply killed.\n",
      "Q.  As the beating continued where did you end up?\n",
      "A.  It ended, I ended up in the hall -- they were beating me and I fell\n",
      "among some pillars, if I recollect, I think they were white and red as\n",
      "if some markings to mark, to bind off a particular area where some\n",
      "work goes on so one cannot enter that area.  So I was among those\n",
      "pillars somehow. I do not know how I got there.  At one point I could\n",
      "not, I was not even trying to come out from amongst those pillars and\n",
      "then two came, approached me, I do not know who they were, I cannot\n",
      "remember, and they got me by my feet and hung me up by a cord.\n",
      "Q.  What was this -- the translation says they hung you up by a cord.\n",
      "What kind of a device was this?\n",
      "A.  I cannot really remember properly, whether it was plated but it was --\n",
      "there was a canal nearby and I think that cord, that cable served to\n",
      "lift some weight, some engines or something like that.  Some large and\n",
      "heavy object I think it served to lift those things up.\n",
      "Q.  How long were you hanging there by your feet upside-down?\n",
      "A.  I could not determine the time with any precision, but not long,\n",
      "several minutes, one minute, two, three, I do not remember exactly.\n",
      "At any rate at some point I felt that my feet had slid out and I fell\n",
      "down and at that moment I remember Dragan approached me again and\n",
      "asked if I knew who he was.\n",
      "Q.  What did you tell him?\n",
      "A.  I told him I did not know him, that I had never seen  him in my life\n",
      "before, that I did not know who he was.\n",
      "Q.  Why did you tell him you did not know who he was and that you had\n",
      "never seen him before?\n",
      "A.  Well, because it was a fact in the camp, it was a common fact in the\n",
      "camp that they never left alive those witnesses who might possibly\n",
      "recognise those guards who killed and tortured.  Simply, they left no\n",
      "witnesses behind.  I realised simply that it would be better for me to\n",
      "say that I did not know him, and even had I known him before I would\n",
      "have said that I did not.\n",
      "Q.  After you told Dragan you had never seen him before, what did he tell\n",
      "you?\n",
      "A.  He said, \"Take this one upstairs and bring me Senad Muslimovic\".\n",
      "Q.  Did you go upstairs?\n",
      "A.  Yes, I started upstairs.  I reached the staircase. I did not even know\n",
      "that I did not have my sneakers on, and at one point they said, \"Go\n",
      "back and fetch your sneakers.\" I said, \"I don't need them\", and Dragan\n",
      "sort of said: \"You want me to fetch them for you?  Come here.\" So what\n",
      "could I do?  I had to go back and they started beating me again.  How\n",
      "I managed to bend down and pick up those sneakers I do not know but I\n",
      "know I did.  Then I climbed up the stairs and entered room 15, and\n",
      "when I was there I made may way to that corner where my place was and\n",
      "I fainted.\n",
      "Q.  Do you know how long you lost consciousness for?\n",
      "A.  I do not know how long I was unconscious, but from what my friends\n",
      "told me, those who washed me with water that brought it from the wash\n",
      "basin, several minutes, it  was several minutes.\n",
      "Q.  When you regained conscious, could you tell whether other prisoners\n",
      "were being beaten downstairs?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  What were you able to hear?\n",
      "A.  I heard screams, screams that I had not known before.  Until I arrived\n",
      "in that camp I had never heard such cries, such screams.  They were\n",
      "human, but I could never imitate them.  I remember I asked a friend\n",
      "Rizah Salas who helped me throughout my stay in the camp and at a\n",
      "point saved my life, if I was also letting out such screams, and he\n",
      "said: \"We heard you, no, not even remotely like that.\"\n",
      "Q.  Within the next couple of days did you find out who had been beaten\n",
      "downstairs?\n",
      "A.  Could you repeat the question, please?\n",
      "Q.  Within the next couple of days after that did you learn who had been\n",
      "beaten downstairs and whose screams you had heard?\n",
      "A.  Yes, we learnt, I think the next day, that it was my friend Jasko,\n",
      "that Emir Karabasic was there who one day before had visited me in the\n",
      "15 and then they had sent him to ask money from the inmates, to\n",
      "collect some money, and probably that was how he had managed to enter\n",
      "the room and reach me and be with me for a while and just patted me on\n",
      "the head and said: \"Take care of yourself, don't worry you will get\n",
      "out\", but he did not stay long. He went out.\n",
      "Q.  What was Jasko's last name?\n",
      "A.  Hrnic.\n",
      "Q.  Where were those men from?\n",
      "A.  Kozarac.\n",
      "Q.  Mr. Beganovic, what injuries did you receive from the beatings?\n",
      "A.  The injuries, they are both bodily and mental, but those physical\n",
      "injuries are worse.  I have fractures on my head, my head was all\n",
      "pierced, was all in holes.  My hand is injured.  I cannot really use\n",
      "it and I think it is even thinner than my right one.  Then my spine is\n",
      "hurt.  My kidneys are injured, my leg.\n",
      "Q.  Did you receive medical care for your injuries in camp?\n",
      "A.  Well, only in so far as the prisoners could help me. You mean whether\n",
      "I received any treatment after the camp?\n",
      "Q.  No, in Omarska itself.\n",
      "A.  Well, there was treatment amongst ourselves.  We looked after one\n",
      "another.  Dr. Eso, because my nose was all to the right and Eso\n",
      "managed to return it.  How well he succeeded you can see for\n",
      "yourselves.\n",
      "Q.  Did Dr. Sadikovic have medical supplies with which to treat you?\n",
      "A.  There were no medicines or any supplies.  From time to time he would\n",
      "go upstairs above the restaurant and there he tended, he looked after\n",
      "the Serb soldiers who came back from the front, those who were\n",
      "wounded, because people often inflicted wounds on themselves when\n",
      "cleaning their weapons.  So he did go upstairs to treat them and then\n",
      "he would manage to get some pills or bandages and some powders.  I\n",
      "remember him bringing some phials, some bottles.  I think he used\n",
      "those powders to make  something.  He had one syringe and he used it\n",
      "for everything.\n",
      "Q.  So Dr. Sadikovic received medical supplies to treat Serb soldiers and\n",
      "smuggle whatever he could to help the Muslim prisoners who were\n",
      "injured?\n",
      "A.  Yes, but it was very, very small quantities.\n",
      "Q.  Did your wounds become infected?\n",
      "A.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.  What was the condition of your wounds?\n",
      "A.  The worst were head injuries, because that cloth, the bandage I had,\n",
      "it was on my head for about a month and it was all rotting and there\n",
      "were worms.  Fortunately Dr. Eso noticed that and asked a guard to\n",
      "take me out when I was in this room above the restaurant and there was\n",
      "a water tap here, to go out and for about two days he kept begging me\n",
      "to go out and I did not dare because I was afraid that one of them\n",
      "would come and recognise me because there were rumours in the camp\n",
      "that I had succumbed.  But he eventually did prevail upon me and I\n",
      "agreed.  He said  that  I  simply  had  to .  So I agreed and he took\n",
      "me out to that tap and there for about an hour he was wetting it and\n",
      "managed to remove those bandages.  There were worms in it.  I did not\n",
      "know that. I learned that the next day and that was why he put\n",
      "pressure on me to wash it, I was to wash it off.\n",
      "Q.  Did other prisoners have worms and infected wounds?\n",
      "A.  Yes, quite a number of cases.  There were guys who had wounds on their\n",
      "backs or all over the body but, for instance, on the backs there were\n",
      "some chaps where two or three litres of pus would simply spurt out on\n",
      "the back.  They had things like a balloon on their backs and it would\n",
      "finally burst.  So there were quite a number of people who were still\n",
      "alive and yet from whom worms were coming out.\n",
      "Q.  Now you have mentioned Dr. Sadikovic on several occasions, both in\n",
      "connection with his efforts with the League for Peace and in the ways\n",
      "he attempted to treat Muslim prisoners.  What happened to Dr.\n",
      "Sadikovic in Omarska?\n",
      "A.  Until 5th August he was with us all the time in this room above the\n",
      "restaurant where we stayed in this small room with 20 or 25 of us.  On\n",
      "5th August he was taken out, perhaps around 11 o'clock in the evening,\n",
      "it was night time, and before that at least on two occasions he had\n",
      "been taken out and brought back and he was told to take his things\n",
      "with him, although he had nothing.  We had said goodbye to him on two\n",
      "occasions, and on the third occasion when he was called out he turned\n",
      "and said to us, \"Fuck you all\".  That is what he told us, jokingly.\n",
      "Q.  Did you ever see or hear of Dr. Sadikovic again?\n",
      "A.  When I came out from the camp in '93, in March, I heard from a\n",
      "relative, from Azo's relative that she had heard from three sides and\n",
      "from different Serb soldiers that he had been in the camp at Ric near\n",
      "Bihac and that he had personally treated them.  However, after that I\n",
      "could not learn anything, even though I keep on enquiring but to no\n",
      "avail.\n",
      "Q.  Mr. Beganovic, can you look and tell us if Dule Tadic is in court\n",
      "today?\n",
      "A.  Yes, he is, Serb garbage.\n",
      "Q.  Sir, please refrain from that language, if you would, and can you\n",
      "point out -- I know you pointed ----\n",
      "A.  I apologise to your Lordships.  I could not stop myself.\n",
      "Q.  You have pointed to where he is sitting.  Can you just tell us what he\n",
      "is wearing, please, or exactly where he is sitting?\n",
      "A.  He is sitting in the back row in the middle.  He has a dark red tie.\n",
      "Q.  Your Honour, may the record reflect the identification of the accused?\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Yes, the record will so reflect the identification\n",
      "of the accused by the witness.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Mr. Beganovic, are you absolutely certain that this is the\n",
      "man who participated in the beating of you which took place on the\n",
      "hangar floor?\n",
      "A.  Absolutely.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Thank you.  I have nothing further.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  You have cross-examination, Mr. Kay?\n",
      "MR. KAY:  Yes, I do your Honour.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  We will recess early.  We will stand in recess until\n",
      "2.30, please.\n",
      "(Luncheon Adjournment)\n",
      "PRIVATE\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Kay, cross-examination?\n",
      "MR. KAY:  Thank you, your Honour.\n",
      "Cross-Examined by MR. KAY\n",
      "Q.   Mr. Beganovic, from what you have told us, it seems that these three\n",
      "serious beatings that you suffered occurred within the period of a\n",
      "week, is that right?\n",
      "A.   Roughly.\n",
      "Q.   The first beating was largely the responsibility of Dragan, is that\n",
      "right?\n",
      "A.   And Nikica Janjic.\n",
      "Q.   And Nikica Janjic?\n",
      "A.   Janjic.\n",
      "Q.   And Dragan's other name is what?\n",
      "A.   I do not know any other name.\n",
      "Q.   Would it be Dragan Vujic or something beginning with the letter \"V\"?\n",
      "Can you remember?\n",
      "A.   I have heard something about it in the camp, but that does not seem\n",
      "to be true.  There seems to be another surname.\n",
      "Q.   Right.  The reason why I put that to you is from the statement that\n",
      "you gave to the Prosecution.  You gave, if you may remember, a number\n",
      "of names for Dragan that began with \"V\", is that right?\n",
      "A.   Yes, but then I pointed out that I was not sure ---\n",
      "Q.   Yes.\n",
      "A.   -- what was involved.\n",
      "Q.   Yes, does it seem to be that it was your impression it could have\n",
      "been a name beginning with \"V\"?\n",
      "A.   I am not sure.  That was just guessing by inmates, but the fact is\n",
      "that he is related to Nedzo Delic, that he had worked  for him that he\n",
      "had worked in the restaurant in Omarska, in Europa, and the other\n",
      "Europa in Prijedor.\n",
      "Q.   Yes.\n",
      "A.   His identity is easy to establish.\n",
      "Q.   Yes.  The second beating that took place upon you, again Nikica\n",
      "Janjic was involved, is that right?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Was Dragan involved in that as well?\n",
      "A.   Not in the second beating.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  The third beating that took place took place in the large\n",
      "building before you on that model which we call the hangar, is that\n",
      "right?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   You had been recovering from those previous beatings in a room that\n",
      "you have identified by calling room 15?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   I was unable to see from here, but I believe you pointed to a fairly\n",
      "large room in the middle of the model on the first floor, is that\n",
      "right?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  You had been in that room for how many days before the\n",
      "third beating took place?\n",
      "A.   About five or six days.\n",
      "Q.   Presumably, in that period of time you were in an appalling physical\n",
      "state with bad and serious injuries to your body?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   And with no medical treatment to restore you and relieve pain?\n",
      "A.   Correct.\n",
      "Q.   Were there a number of other men in that room in a similar  condition\n",
      "at that time?\n",
      "A.   Yes, there was a large number of injured people.  I cannot tell you\n",
      "for sure how many because I was in a corner, but I know that there\n",
      "were many such people similar to me, beaten up.\n",
      "Q.   That room that you were in, room 15, were there many people also\n",
      "confined into that space?\n",
      "A.   Yes, several hundred people, maybe 300.\n",
      "Q.   Presumably as well, many of them were suffering the same bad\n",
      "conditions in relation to their eating, sanitation and drinking that\n",
      "you had experienced?  Is that right?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   This is something that you would never have experienced in your life\n",
      "before?\n",
      "A.   Normally.\n",
      "Q.   Something that probably drove you to the limit of your endurance?\n",
      "A.   Yes, I was at the limit of my endurance.\n",
      "Q.   The position that you were being kept within in this room,\n",
      "presumably, suffered from lack of ventilation and would have been a\n",
      "room that was baking in the sun because of the weather at the time,\n",
      "would that be right?\n",
      "A.   How can you bake in the sun in a closed room?\n",
      "Q.   We heard from one witness about the outside temperature being so hot\n",
      "that the rooms in that building because of the tin roof had an almost\n",
      "oven effect and caused the conditions to be very hot.\n",
      "A.   It was hot, yes.\n",
      "Q.   On the occasion of the third beating, you were still in room 15?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Had you had much opportunity to obtain food during the period of the\n",
      "previous week?\n",
      "A.   I did not go out to eat.  I ate what I was given by my friends, a\n",
      "piece of bread in their pockets.  That is all I ate.\n",
      "Q.   Presumably, that was to avoid further contact with guards as well as\n",
      "because of your strength, would that be right?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   You have described being in a corner of room 15.  Would that have\n",
      "been a corner furthest from the door which you indicated on the model\n",
      "was the door how you actually entered the room, or was it a corner\n",
      "nearer the door?\n",
      "A.   I was in the right-hand corner and the left-hand corner was further\n",
      "away from the door than the right-hand corner.\n",
      "Q.   Was it the opposite end of the room though to the door?\n",
      "A.   As you enter the main door, you pass the first part of the room.  On\n",
      "the one side there are showers, on the other side wash basins.  You go\n",
      "into this part of the room.  I was lying on the right-hand side in the\n",
      "corner.  So the left-hand corner is further away than the right-hand\n",
      "corner.\n",
      "Q.   I think that gives us an indication as to where you were. You said\n",
      "that it was later in the afternoon around 6 o'clock that you heard a\n",
      "voice from the entrance to the door.  Did that voice call your name?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Did you then go down the room to the door to see the person who\n",
      "called your name?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Was that Nikica or another guard or someone else?  Can you tell us\n",
      "who that was?\n",
      "A.   It was Dragan, the one we talked about a while ago.\n",
      "Q.   Dragan was standing there, and was he on his own or with anyone else?\n",
      "A.   On his own.\n",
      "Q.   Then did he take you down the stairs to the ground floor of the\n",
      "building?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Did he tell you at all what was going to happen, why he had called\n",
      "your name?\n",
      "A.   No.\n",
      "Q.   Did you have any feelings in your own mind as to why he called your\n",
      "name then?\n",
      "A.   Since I had experienced -- I had experience with him, I knew what to\n",
      "expect roughly, but I prayed to God that he would kill me so that I\n",
      "would not be tortured any more.\n",
      "Q.   Can you remember when abouts during your stay in Omarska this was?\n",
      "A.   In the middle of June.  I cannot be sure of two or three days, but\n",
      "that is the time.\n",
      "Q.   Of course not.  I understand it would seem from what you are saying\n",
      "if it was in the middle of June that you may have been in the camp for\n",
      "some two-and-a-half weeks by then, would that be right?\n",
      "A.   Yes, about two weeks.\n",
      "Q.   When you left that room and went down the stairs with Dragan and you\n",
      "said that he was the only guard there, were there other guards,\n",
      "nothing to do with this incident, around on the stairs or nearby as\n",
      "you went down?\n",
      "A.   As I went down, there was nobody, but when he told me to go towards\n",
      "the hangar I saw the group in the hangar, I saw the group which would\n",
      "torture me later on.\n",
      "Q.   You have referred there to the hangar.  We know that this was a\n",
      "mining complex and we know what this building was used for when it was\n",
      "working as a mine.  Can you tell us what was actually in the hangar at\n",
      "this time?\n",
      "A.   There were some parts of probably dump trucks, lorries. I think there\n",
      "was a dump truck further down on the left-hand side as you enter the\n",
      "hangar, left of the canal.  It was not important to me at the time\n",
      "what was there.  The only thing I was concerned with was the criminals\n",
      "when I entered.\n",
      "Q.   Was it used at all at this time for the holding of any of the\n",
      "prisoners within Omarska?\n",
      "A.   Which area do you have in mind?\n",
      "Q.   I ask this because we have heard evidence that at some stage, I do\n",
      "not know when, the prisoners were kept in an area of this hangar, and\n",
      "what I am asking you is if at that time when you went down whether\n",
      "that was the case then?\n",
      "A.   True, but at that time there had not been -- by that time there had\n",
      "not been any inmates in the hangar.\n",
      "Q.   So what appears to have been within it was equipment connected with\n",
      "lorries and the use of those lorries, is that right?\n",
      "A.   About that, yes.\n",
      "Q.   When you went into the hangar, you have described what you say is the\n",
      "group of criminals.  How many people did you see there in this group?\n",
      "A.   I did not get round to counting them, but there were between seven\n",
      "and 10.\n",
      "Q.   Dragan had brought you down from the upstairs of the building.  Did\n",
      "you have to walk with any help or what was your physical condition in\n",
      "relation to how you could move at that  time?\n",
      "A.   I was still able to stand on my feet.\n",
      "Q.   Would it be fair to say that that would have been though with quite a\n",
      "degree of pain and discomfort?\n",
      "A.   Of course.\n",
      "Q.   Yes.  Those various beatings that you had received on those other two\n",
      "occasions had been beatings, from what you have told us, over the\n",
      "whole of your body?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   You described the group of men as wearing different kinds of clothes,\n",
      "but that they were all military uniforms?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Are you able to tell us what different kinds of military uniforms\n",
      "those clothes would have been?\n",
      "A.   Some of them wore multi-coloured uniforms, we called them\n",
      "multi-colours, and others had grey olive uniforms of the former JNA.\n",
      "Q.   When you say \"multi-coloured uniforms\", is that camouflage uniforms?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Did any of them wear berets, hats of any kind?\n",
      "A.   They did, but at that time it did not make any difference whether he\n",
      "had a hat on or not.  We were not interested in that at all.\n",
      "Q.   I am just asking you this to get an idea of the various kinds of\n",
      "clothing that were being worn.  Can you remember any particular kinds\n",
      "of hats or berets, if there were any?\n",
      "A.   They had hats, caps.  They dressed as they pleased.  They did not\n",
      "look like an army.  It looked like a band of wanton people. We could\n",
      "see from the start that there was no commanding  hierarchy, no army,\n",
      "no men.\n",
      "Q.   Would it be right to say that Dragan was the person who was in charge\n",
      "of you?\n",
      "A.   That was my impression, yes.\n",
      "Q.   He had a military uniform, you said, with a white belt?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Did any of the others have a similar colour belt?\n",
      "A.   I cannot remember at this time, nor did I try very hard to observe\n",
      "that.  I was -- I did not believe that I would come out of the camp\n",
      "and especially that a day would come that I could testify to being\n",
      "there.  If I had been aware of that, I would have remembered and\n",
      "observed more.\n",
      "Q.   I understand that, and do not take any of these questions as being a\n",
      "criticism of you.  I am asking them as part of my job, you understand?\n",
      "Can you remember the kind of footwear perhaps that was being worn,\n",
      "whether they were boots or other form of ----\n",
      "A.   Mostly military boots.\n",
      "Q.   By that do you mean the black military boot?\n",
      "A.   Yes, the military boot of the former JNA.\n",
      "Q.   Yes.  Did you see any weapons there amongst the men, and by that I\n",
      "mean guns or rifles or machine guns?\n",
      "A.   They mostly wore automatic weapons and pistols.\n",
      "Q.   When you say \"wore\" automatic weapons, do you mean they had them with\n",
      "them or they were actually on their bodies in some way?\n",
      "A.   Mostly had them in their hands.\n",
      "Q.   When you were down there with these men, did you notice if there were\n",
      "any other prisoners that you could see within the hangar?\n",
      "A.   While I was there I did not notice any.\n",
      "Q.   Were you the focus of attention of the group?  They were not doing\n",
      "anything to anyone else, was it just you?\n",
      "A.   I did not notice that.  I did not notice anybody else.\n",
      "Q.   This room, the hangar, was it lit at all?  What were the lighting\n",
      "conditions within it?\n",
      "A.   I did not see any lighting.  It was still daylight.\n",
      "Q.   Yes.  We can see on that model that there are what I would call\n",
      "roller doors -- I do not know if that translates -- but shutters that\n",
      "go up and down, were they up or down?\n",
      "A.   I did not notice those things.\n",
      "Q.   Fine.  Within that group when you gave evidence this morning you said\n",
      "that Dule Tadic was a member of that group?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Can you name any of the other people who made up that group?\n",
      "A.   There was another guy who in the first time I was beaten stood in the\n",
      "doorway holding an automatic rifle in his hands so that I would not\n",
      "escape through the door, I noticed him; that Dusko and there was\n",
      "Dragan, others, I did not really notice them except those I knew, but\n",
      "I had the impression that all the guards were there.  Guards who were\n",
      "on duty there, I did not notice them.\n",
      "Q.   The one you referred to as also being present the first time you were\n",
      "beaten who was in the door with his rifle to stop you escaping, did\n",
      "you know his name at all?\n",
      "A.   No.\n",
      "Q.   Was he a guard at the camp?\n",
      "A.   No.\n",
      "Q.   Were there any guards there from the camp in the hangar at  that\n",
      "time?\n",
      "A.   No, and they would mostly be admitted in, the guards would stay\n",
      "outside and then they indulged in orgies with us.\n",
      "Q.   Because Dragan whom you have mentioned, was he actually a guard at\n",
      "the camp?\n",
      "A.   No.\n",
      "Q.   You were taken into that hangar by Dragan.  You told us that he\n",
      "started hitting you with a baton as you were going down the steps.\n",
      "Was that the first series of blows on this occasion that you felt?\n",
      "A.   Yes, he began beating me as I was coming down the stairs when he\n",
      "directed me towards the hangar.  That is when he started dealing\n",
      "blows.\n",
      "Q.   He was giving this treatment to you and it was coming upon injuries\n",
      "that you had already suffered?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   When you got to the bottom of the stairs, how did you get into the\n",
      "hangar?\n",
      "A.   On my feet.\n",
      "Q.   I perhaps did not ask that very clearly but there are big doors, are\n",
      "there not, with glass in them, am I right about that?\n",
      "A.   There was a glass door.\n",
      "Q.   Yes.  Did you have to open that yourself or did he open it for you\n",
      "and let you through?\n",
      "A.   I believe it was open.  Yes, it was open.\n",
      "Q.   You entered the hangar.  Did he continue beating you?\n",
      "A.   Yes, towards that group and then the group took over.\n",
      "Q.   The group, you have identified them as a group which implies that\n",
      "they were very much together in close proximity, would that be right?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   As you entered the doors, whereabouts exactly were the group\n",
      "positioned, can you remember how far from the doors?\n",
      "A.   Oh, a couple of metres inside the hangar, about halfway in the middle\n",
      "of the hangar.\n",
      "Q.   Right.  There are some canals that we know of within this hangar,\n",
      "maybe three or four.  Do you know what I am talking about when I refer\n",
      "to them?  I did not hear any translation.\n",
      "THE INTERPRETER: There was none.\n",
      "MR. KAY:  Do you know what I am talking about when I refer to the canals\n",
      "within the hangar?\n",
      "A.   Canals to repair dump trucks ---\n",
      "Q.   That is right.\n",
      "A.   -- and lorries and things.\n",
      "Q.   Get underneath them, go into a sort of a pit.  Do you know what I am\n",
      "talking about within that hangar?  Did you see those?\n",
      "A.   I did.\n",
      "Q.   Are you able to see in relation to those pits whereabouts the men\n",
      "were?  Were they on that side or a different part of the hangar?\n",
      "A.   In that half beyond the canals.\n",
      "Q.   Yes.  Dragan, presumably, was the man who forced you towards them or\n",
      "did they come to meet you?\n",
      "A.   I went towards them.\n",
      "Q.   Did anyone talk to you or did the beating just start?\n",
      "A.   They were not saying anything.  They were simply cursing. During all\n",
      "those beatings always there were no conversations of any kind.  They\n",
      "would curse at you because you were a Muslim and they would hit you.\n",
      "I mean, there was no conversation there. They would not let you.  All\n",
      "they cared about, how to hit you in  the most vulnerable spot, no\n",
      "talking.  Just curses and noise, that is all.\n",
      "Q.   From the way you describe it, it would be right to say that it was\n",
      "the whole group that was involved in attacking you?\n",
      "A.   Well, the whole group, some probably hit me more times, sometimes\n",
      "less, but I had no time to count how many times who each of them hit\n",
      "me.\n",
      "Q.   Again when you came into that hangar, as you have told us, you were\n",
      "on your feet, you were walking, but you were being hit by Dragan, is\n",
      "that right?\n",
      "A.   It is.\n",
      "Q.   Was he behind you hitting you or to the side or front hitting you?\n",
      "Can you tell us whereabouts he was?\n",
      "A.   Behind me.\n",
      "Q.   He was hitting you on your back, presumably?  Was it on the back of\n",
      "your head?\n",
      "A.   Yes, the neck, head, shoulders -- that is where he hit me most.\n",
      "Q.   You yourself had a bandaged head because of the appalling head\n",
      "injuries you had suffered the time of the previous beatings, is that\n",
      "right?\n",
      "A.   It is.\n",
      "Q.   The distance that he hit you towards this group was how much, are you\n",
      "able to tell us?\n",
      "A.   Five or six metres, perhaps 10, I do not know.  Five or six metres.\n",
      "Q.   Did the group immediately start hitting you like Dragan was doing?  I\n",
      "will repeat the question because I do not think there is a translation\n",
      "for the witness.  Did the group start hitting you like Dragan had been\n",
      "doing?\n",
      "A.   Why, they beat me, Dragan used only batons and they used their rifle\n",
      "butts, feet, rods, but basically with their feet. Those karateists,\n",
      "they were the ones, perhaps they were doing their exercises --\n",
      "training with me.\n",
      "Q.   Presumably, you would have been kicked or hit to the ground?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   You did not remain on your feet?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   The length of time that this continued for, are you able to tell us\n",
      "in any way?\n",
      "A.   Well, about 20 minutes, 15, 20 -- it looked like eternity to me.\n",
      "Q.   What I want to ask you about is Dusko Tadic, when you first say that\n",
      "you came to know of him and his name.  When do you say you first came\n",
      "across him, if you like?\n",
      "A.   I knew of his existence.  I have known it for some 10 years.  As I\n",
      "have already said, I knew him from sight.  I knew that he was Dule.  I\n",
      "did not know his full name, but I knew he was Dule.  I knew his family\n",
      "name was Tadic, that he lived in Kozarac and that he was practising\n",
      "karate and coaching karate. I knew he was no good, that he was a\n",
      "trouble maker.  He used to come to Prijedor on the street where my\n",
      "business was, and there he was beaten once by Remzo, Cero and those\n",
      "friends of mine. I knew all that went on in that street, since my\n",
      "coffee bar was the best known and the most popular in Prijedor and\n",
      "very many young people came there, so that I know him, you see.  For\n",
      "10 years I have known who he was, what he was, where he came from.\n",
      "Q.   So you are talking about being aware of him, is that right, for some\n",
      "10 years?\n",
      "A.   Correct.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  If you answer the question because there has to be a\n",
      "translation.  When you say you saw him in the hangar on that occasion\n",
      "when you received the third beating, are you able to describe what he\n",
      "looked like?\n",
      "A.   Well, to my mind, like everybody else when he was wearing a military\n",
      "uniform.  I remember that, simply I recognised him immediately.\n",
      "Q.   When you say you recognised him, was there anything about his\n",
      "appearance that you could describe how he looked?\n",
      "A.   I have just said briefly, he was not alone so that I would look at\n",
      "him only.  I was looking at them, at that group of seven or 10 people,\n",
      "so that he was the only one whose name I knew from that group.\n",
      "Dragan's name I learnt in the camp and that other one who took part in\n",
      "former beatings, I still do not know his name to this day, so it is\n",
      "quite natural that his name stuck in my mind.  But before that, I have\n",
      "never had any trouble with him before.  At that time I was not as\n",
      "scared of him as thinking of Dragan and what Dragan was going to do to\n",
      "me.  I believe he could not recognise me because from the previous\n",
      "beating, my mine, my face was all disshaped, misshapen, and when the\n",
      "one upstairs had called out my name, I guess that he did not have the\n",
      "faintest idea who they were talking about.\n",
      "Q.   You rightly say that you were not concentrating on one person because\n",
      "what was happening to you involved the whole group of seven or 10,\n",
      "that is right, is it not?\n",
      "A.   Yes, it is.\n",
      "Q.   You were not being politely taken into this room by Dragan; you were\n",
      "being hit by him from behind?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   From what had happened to you in those previous days, you were not in\n",
      "your normal physical condition, that is right, is it not?\n",
      "A.   Physically, no, naturally, but mentally I was well enough to notice\n",
      "that Dule Tadic was there and that he was practising some blows on me.\n",
      "More him, I cannot even remember those other faces because they meant\n",
      "nothing to me.  I did not recognise anyone of them.  They must have\n",
      "been the population from Omarska and perhaps other villages there who\n",
      "never came down, so I could not know them nor could they know me.\n",
      "Q.   When you say that you recollected Dule Tadic because the name stuck\n",
      "in your mind, it is right to say that you have talked about things\n",
      "with other people when you were in the camp then as well as in\n",
      "Manjaca?\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Excuse me.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  I would like to object to a mischaracterisation of the\n",
      "evidence.  The witness did not say he recollected Dule Tadic because\n",
      "of the name.  He said that he recognised him for that reason and did\n",
      "not know the other names, and so it is natural that he would remember\n",
      "Mr. Tadic.  Counsel is building in a mischaracterisation into that\n",
      "question.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  That is how I recall the testimony. I suppose we\n",
      "could have it turned back.\n",
      "MR. KAY:  I apologise and I am sure the Court will allow me to start again\n",
      "and put whatever I should put correctly.  You say that the name stuck\n",
      "in your mind, is that right?\n",
      "A.   The face features.\n",
      "Q.   When you say the face and features, had the face or features changed\n",
      "in any way from how you had seen Dusko Tadic from before?\n",
      "A.   At that time they had not changed at all.  They are changed now.\n",
      "Q.   So the person who was hitting you then had a look, an appearance, as\n",
      "you say it was Dusko Tadic, he had not changed in his appearance from\n",
      "when you had known him from before, is that right?\n",
      "A.   It was him, I was not having any halucinations.  I did not have to\n",
      "think any.  I am positive.  I was quite sure it was him.\n",
      "Q.   You see, what I suggest to you is that, in fact, what was happening\n",
      "to you was so extreme that it was difficult for you to accurately\n",
      "recognise Dusko Tadic and be right about it, do you understand?\n",
      "A.   I was strong enough to recognise him, to know that it was he and not\n",
      "forced to think whether it was he or not and that I made a mistake.\n",
      "Q.   You refer to your mental state, but you had suffered appalling\n",
      "deprivation in that time in Omarska in terms of your health, physical\n",
      "condition, is that not right?\n",
      "A.   That is right, but I was, I still had enough of my wits about to know\n",
      "that it was he, that I could not make a mistake.\n",
      "Q.   Because what I am putting to you is this, that in fact it was someone\n",
      "who looked like him but it was not him?\n",
      "A.   No, it was he.\n",
      "Q.   This name is something that you have picked up because others were\n",
      "talking about it in the camp?\n",
      "A.   Why should I?  I knew him more than those other people. There was\n",
      "nothing -- they could hear it from me, not I from them.\n",
      "Q.   You have never had a conversation with Dusko Tadic, is that right?\n",
      "A.   No.\n",
      "Q.   You have never sat at a table with Dusko Tadic, is that right?\n",
      "A.   Yes, in a coffee, in the coffee bar just, but not together because we\n",
      "had no reason to strike any friendships even before the war.\n",
      "Q.   Do you know Miso Danicic?\n",
      "A.   I do not know that surname.\n",
      "MR. KAY:  Thank you.  I have no further questions.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Tieger, any redirect?\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  No, your Honour.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Is there any objection to -- I am sorry.\n",
      "JUDGE STEPHEN:  Witness, I have one question to ask you.  Did alcohol play\n",
      "any part in the camp as far as the guards were concerned or those who\n",
      "came in and beat you?  Did they seem to be drunk or not?\n",
      "A.   Oh, yes, alcohol played a tremendous role there.  They were almost\n",
      "all drunk and regularly, day in, day out, and we were blackmailed.\n",
      "They would take a man, put a pistol in his mouth and say, \"Get me\n",
      "1,000 marks in\", I do not know, \"within 15 or 20 minutes or we will\n",
      "kill him\", and of course we had to find that money, whether we knew\n",
      "the man or not.  I mean, those who managed somehow to bring the money\n",
      "in, we collected 10 marks, 15 marks, it depended, but towards the end\n",
      "we stopped giving it because we knew that they were going to kill us\n",
      "all, so we thought, \"What is the use?  He will only suffer more so let\n",
      "them\", and then they became even stricter.  They were requesting, I do\n",
      "not know, 230 marks and then they dropped the price to a crate of beer\n",
      "because they simply could not do without beer or drink.\n",
      "Q.   Did the guards have a meeting room, a common room, where they drank\n",
      "or did you see them drink or do you know anything of how they ate?\n",
      "Where did they eat, for instance, the guards?\n",
      "A.   They do not know it -- yes, while I was in this room behind the\n",
      "restaurant, here where this tap is, there was a van and the door of\n",
      "this van was always open, the rear door could always be open, and\n",
      "there was a machine gun directed at this door through which we entered\n",
      "behind the tap, and they drank there non-stop bottles of brandy, of\n",
      "cognac, crates of beer.  What they ate? What do I know what those scum\n",
      "ate -- pork, must be.\n",
      "Q.   One other question, you spent some time on the pista in the open air?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Of a night would you sleep on the pista or were you always taken into\n",
      "the so-called restaurant at night?\n",
      "A.   The first four or five days I spent nights on the pista. There was a\n",
      "machine gun positioned up here on this roof, and in the evening it was\n",
      "sighted on us, it was aimed at us, and after some five or six days\n",
      "there was a shower so that they would not get soaked and better to\n",
      "keep us under control, they forced us into the restaurant.  We would\n",
      "spend the night there until the day break, and at day break they would\n",
      "force us out into the pista. On the pista there were those puddles of\n",
      "water after the rain, but who cared?  Each one had to take his place,\n",
      "whether wet or dry, and lie down again.\n",
      "Q.   The last question I wanted to ask you is I take it the pista was\n",
      "floodlit at night?\n",
      "A.   It was lit around it, not where we were.  As far as I can remember,\n",
      "there were some lights here and there, but they had a good view.\n",
      "There was a wall here and there was this machine  gun.  Joja, one of\n",
      "those, I do not know who he is, and he always kept it aimed at us, so\n",
      "we had no chance, not even a theoretical chance, to attempt an escape\n",
      "or a rebellion or something because I think it would not take a minute\n",
      "to kill us all and sometimes we were 700 or 600, 800 of us, so that we\n",
      "had no chance whatsoever.\n",
      "JUDGE STEPHEN:  Thank you.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Tieger, do you have additional questions?\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  No, your Honour.\n",

      "MR. TIEGER:  Yes, your Honour, the next witness is Senad Muslimovic.\n",
      "SENAD MUSLIMOVIC, called.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Would you take the oath that is being handed to you,\n",
      "please?\n",
      "THE WITNESS [In translation]:  I solemnly declare that I will speak the\n",
      "truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n",

      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you, sir.  Would you be seated?\n",
      "Examined by MR. TIEGER\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Tieger?\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Thank you, your Honour.  Sir, what is your name?\n",
      "A.   Senad Muslimovic.\n",
      "Q.   Mr. Muslimovic, you may want to move a little bit away from the\n",
      "microphone when you speak.  What year were you born?\n",
      "A.   In 1963.\n",
      "Q.   Where were you born?\n",
      "A.   Prijedor.\n",
      "Q.   Were you also raised in Prijedor?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   What is your nationality?\n",
      "A.   Muslim.\n",
      "Q.   Did you serve in the JNA?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   When was that?\n",
      "A.   I think in 1981.\n",
      "Q.   Before the war exactly where in Prijedor did you live, not the\n",
      "address but what part of town?\n",
      "A.   An area that boarded on the centre of the city called Puharska.\n",
      "Q.   Mr. Muslimovic, is it correct that you come from a rather well-known\n",
      "family in Bosnia, in particular, because of your brother's success in\n",
      "the music business?\n",
      "A.   I hope that that was the case.  I think that is so.\n",
      "Q.   Your brother is a very popular and well-known folk singer in Bosnia,\n",
      "is that right?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   You worked in the music business with him and worked together with\n",
      "him when he toured?\n",
      "A.   That is correct.\n",
      "Q.   In fact, you spent a great deal of time outside of Prijedor as a\n",
      "result of your work?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Prior to the tensions which preceded the actual conflict in Prijedor\n",
      "and in Bosnia, did people in Prijedor tend to distinguish between who\n",
      "was Muslim and who was Serb?\n",
      "A.   I personally did not.  I think others were not able to do so either.\n",
      "Q.   Did you have Serb friends?\n",
      "A.   I had many more Serbian friends than if I can say Muslim friends.\n",
      "Q.   Was that in part of because of the nature of your work?\n",
      "A.   I would not be able to tell you exactly.  I had such friends, that\n",
      "happens to be the case.  I had those friends and I was fond of them.\n",
      "Q.   Was it possible to distinguish between a Muslim and a Serb based on\n",
      "their physical appearance, based on their face?\n",
      "A.   It is impossible for me.  Maybe someone in the world might do that\n",
      "but I could not.  I could never do that.\n",
      "Q.   In addition to your work in the music business, did you also have\n",
      "your own grocery business in Prijedor before the war?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   As a result of the tensions which occurred before the conflict\n",
      "actually began, did you send your wife and children away to Slovenia\n",
      "for safety at some point before May?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Were you yourself in Prijedor when the cleansing of  Prijedor town\n",
      "began on May 30th?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Were you seized or arrested the following day?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Had you seen what happened to your home before that, before you were\n",
      "captured?\n",
      "A.   Yes, certainly.\n",
      "Q.   What had happened to it, sir?\n",
      "A.   I watched everything from the part of a town which was opposite my\n",
      "house and called Percani.  I was staying with a friend called Dzevad\n",
      "Deomic.  I was in his bedroom watching. There were fires here and\n",
      "there in the area of Puharska.  At one point from one part of a road\n",
      "down from my house, a tank came out and started moving in the\n",
      "direction of Banja Luka.  That is the easiest explanation, if I say in\n",
      "the direction of Banja Luka, because the road connected Bosanski Novi\n",
      "and Banja Luka. They passed my house.  I would not be able to tell you\n",
      "how many metres, but I know that they crossed the bridge next to my\n",
      "house.  Then they came back and then they trained the barrel towards\n",
      "my house and fired at it.  That is all.\n",
      "Q.   May we call up on the monitor Z5-35?  Looking at the monitor, Mr.\n",
      "Muslimovic, do you recognise what is shown on it?\n",
      "A.   Certainly that is my house when it was, the way it looked when it was\n",
      "built about 10 or 12 years ago.  During the war it was even bigger and\n",
      "more beautiful.  It was my family house which belongs to my father, to\n",
      "my brother, to my mother.  We lived there together.\n",
      "Q.   It included the entire structure shown in the picture in addition to\n",
      "a portion which had not yet been built at the time this picture was\n",
      "taken?\n",
      "A.   I did not understand the question, would you please repeat it?\n",
      "Q.   Your family house consisted of the entire structure shown in this\n",
      "picture, is that right?\n",
      "A.   Yes, but 10 years ago, maybe even longer than that, but just before\n",
      "the war it was much bigger and more beautiful.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Your Honour, I would tender that in I am not quite sure what\n",
      "form we can do so.  I would actually like to return the actual\n",
      "photograph to the witness, if possible, so if it is technically\n",
      "feasible to capture an image of what is on the screen now or certainly\n",
      "a photographic copy.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Take it wherever it is, retrieve it and make a copy\n",
      "of it.  What Exhibit number will this be then so that we have a hard\n",
      "copy?\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Exhibit 253, your Honour.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Any objection to 253?\n",
      "MR. WLADIMIROFF:  No, your Honour.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  OK.  253 will be admitted.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Your Honour, Miss Sutherland suggests that perhaps we could\n",
      "make this 253A and the following photograph can be 253B.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Exhibit 253A.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Can we also now call up on the monitor Z5-34?\n",
      "(To the witness):  Mr. Muslimovic, do you recognise this picture and is\n",
      "this a picture of your home after the conflict?\n",
      "A.   Certainly.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  I would tender this, your Honour.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Any objection?\n",
      "MR. WLADIMIROFF:  No, your Honour.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Exhibit 253B will be admitted.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Thank you.  (To the witness):  Mr. Muslimovic, after you were\n",
      "arrested or seized on May 31st where were you first taken?\n",
      "A.   I was taken to the police station in Prijedor.\n",
      "Q.   Were you struck or beaten when you were being transported to the\n",
      "police station?\n",
      "A.   Yes, of course.\n",
      "Q.   When you arrived was there a group or cordon of Serbian police\n",
      "waiting who also beat you?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   While you were at the SUP was there an attempt or a threat of an\n",
      "execution?\n",
      "A.   Not every day but every other day.\n",
      "Q.   On the day you were taken to the SUP, were you lined up for execution\n",
      "at some point?\n",
      "A.   Correct.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Where were you lined up?\n",
      "A.   I was lined up in the courtyard, if I can call it, of the SUP behind\n",
      "the main entrance on the other side next to the wall.  On the\n",
      "left-hand side, there was a door.  That is where I was put together\n",
      "for the act that they had planned to carry out.\n",
      "Q.   You said you were on the other side next to a wall, what was the\n",
      "condition of that wall?\n",
      "A.   It was smeared with blood and there were pot marks that looked like\n",
      "bullet scars, but at that moment nobody paid enough attention to\n",
      "decide 100 per cent what sort of hole it was.  When I was placed\n",
      "there, the only thing, the only things I could see was the blood and\n",
      "the holes.\n",
      "Q.   What occurred to stop the execution?\n",
      "A.   For a split moment, after a very short moment, from the main room of\n",
      "the SUP building a gentleman who was a stranger to me came out.  I can\n",
      "call him a gentleman.  He said that this cannot happen, that we are\n",
      "loyal citizens of that town and nobody can do us any harm.  But,\n",
      "however, it went on for a certain time and he placed some people to\n",
      "watch me like nothing would happen, but it lasted only the time,\n",
      "during the time that he was in the doorway.  As soon as he went back,\n",
      "we were beaten again, not as badly as later, but there were blows on\n",
      "the head with the rifle, just beating, until a situation materialised\n",
      "in which I was saved.  They usually beat people until someone came\n",
      "along who did not like his friend to be beaten without any reason.\n",
      "That is all.\n",
      "Q.   After you were held in the SUP, where were you taken?\n",
      "A.   After the incident in the courtyard (which seemed very long to me,\n",
      "like a year although it must have been short), we were taken to a room\n",
      "and then from that room we were taken again to the courtyard, if I can\n",
      "call it that, where we were delivered many, many blows on all sides.\n",
      "You could not observe who was doing it.  We had to bow down and\n",
      "protect our head as much as possible.\n",
      "We were lined up there, there might have been five, six or\n",
      "seven.  I did not look around very much in front of me or around me.\n",
      "I did not have enough courage to do so.  There was also alternative\n",
      "beating until they took us to the room, the room, to the premises of\n",
      "the main SUP.  If we passed a soldier, that soldier would hit you with\n",
      "a rifle or kick you or you would just get a slap in the face.  We went\n",
      "through the SUP, went out.  We were thrown, not taken, into the bus,\n",
      "we were thrown on to a bus, which already had people on it.  That is\n",
      "all.\n",
      "Q.   Did that bus take you to Keraterm?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Approximately, how long were you held in Keraterm?\n",
      "A.   Would you please repeat the question?  How long?  Is it a question\n",
      "about my time in Keraterm or the time the trip took?\n",
      "Q.   No, your time in Keraterm, how long were you actually held in\n",
      "Keraterm?\n",
      "A.   I think about -- a day lasted as long as a year, sometimes it was\n",
      "faster and very slow, but I think seven or 10 days, but I would not\n",
      "say -- I do not think it was 10 days.\n",
      "Q.   In what part of Keraterm were you held?\n",
      "A.   Still dark that night, we were chased out of the bus and put in the\n",
      "first room which was located at the corner of the building.  I do not\n",
      "know what the purpose of the room was, but it was at the corner\n",
      "itself.\n",
      "Q.   During the time you were held in Keraterm were prisoners called from\n",
      "your room at night?\n",
      "A.   Yes, they were.\n",
      "Q.   Were you able to hear what was happening to them?\n",
      "A.   Yes, I was able to hear, yes.  It was not small things when you hear\n",
      "a man screaming, yelling, howling, roaring, it is hard to imitate that\n",
      "under normal conditions.  That is what I heard, screams, shrieks,\n",
      "moans.  That is all.\n",
      "Q.   Did all the prisoners who were called from the room return?\n",
      "A.   Generally, it is hard to say what number, you always expect to be the\n",
      "next one so you do not think about numbers. Generally, there were more\n",
      "people called out than those who returned.\n",
      "Q.   What was the condition of those who returned?\n",
      "A.   You know, from our point of view, they looked like they had  been\n",
      "wounded.  Sometimes they looked like walking corpses.  It seems\n",
      "impossible, but that is what they looked like.\n",
      "Q.   While you were in Keraterm were you called out for interrogation?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   What kinds of questions were you asked during the interrogation?\n",
      "A.   How should I tell you?  The first question was, \"Where is your money?\n",
      "Where did you hide your money?  Where are your weapons?  Why did you\n",
      "help any of the Parties?\"  But, however, I have never been a member of\n",
      "any political party.  \"How much money did your brother give for this\n",
      "one, for that one?\" Everything was revolved around, \"Where is your\n",
      "money?  Where were you that day, on such-and-such a day, at\n",
      "such-and-such a moment?\"  If I can say so, those questions were stupid\n",
      "to me. That is all.  I had to say where I had left gold, money, that I\n",
      "did not have because I had invested everything.  I did not have any\n",
      "capital because I had invested everything, but all the time I was\n",
      "asked for money.\n",
      "Q.   When the interrogators were not completely satisfied with your\n",
      "answers, what did they tell you?\n",
      "A.   They would say, \"We have better methods, you will admit eventually\".\n",
      "Q.   Were you taken out of Keraterm at some point for a short time?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Who took you out of Keraterm?\n",
      "A.   I was taken by a man who was called by everybody in the camp Zigic,\n",
      "and whom everybody knew by that nickname.\n",
      "Q.   Why did this man Zigic take you out of camp?\n",
      "A.   I can claim that because I was escorted by them to my house, but\n",
      "first they told me to go into Halid's house and look for money and\n",
      "gold, and then they went to my house and told me to look for it, but I\n",
      "did not have any.  You know what happens after that; beatings, torture\n",
      "and then taking me back to the camp.\n",
      "Q.   So first they took you to your brother's house and then to your house\n",
      "looking for valuables?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   After the period of ---\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   -- of time you indicated, were you taken from Keraterm to Omarska?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   In what part of Omarska were you held after you arrived?\n",
      "A.   I was placed in room No. 15.  That is what I heard the number was.\n",
      "There was no number on it, but that is what it was called, room No.\n",
      "15.\n",
      "Q.   Mr. Muslimovic, do not take off your headphones just yet, but I will\n",
      "ask you to get up and point out on the model in front of you -- you\n",
      "may use the pointer to your right, if you wish -- where the room in\n",
      "which you were held which you knew as room 15 was.  You may want to\n",
      "remove your headphones when you walk over and point it out.\n",
      "A.   Shall I begin?\n",
      "Q.   Yes, please.  If you could also put on those headphones when you get\n",
      "over there in case there is something else I need to ask you.\n",
      "A.   Is that all?\n",
      "Q.   Yes.  If you could first point to room 15, please?\n",
      "A.   (The witness indicated on the model).\n",
      "Q.   Can you read the numbers which are on the floor of the area which\n",
      "comprises room 15?\n",
      "A.   B7, B23 and B8.\n",
      "Q.   Yes, you can return to your seat.  What did room 15 consist of?\n",
      "A.   What do you mean?  I did not understand the question.  Are you\n",
      "referring to the material it was made of or what it was composed of?\n",
      "Q.   Let me ask you this question.  Did you have a particular place in the\n",
      "room?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  I was in a shower booth.  It was so big that two of us had to\n",
      "sleep in it and you know roughly how big it is. Sometimes there were\n",
      "three of us sleeping in one shower booth.\n",
      "Q.   Can we call up Z3, 15-13, please?  Mr. Muslimovic, do you recognise\n",
      "what is shown in this photograph?\n",
      "A.   Certainly.\n",
      "Q.   Are those some of the shower booths in room 15?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Was your place on this side or on the other side?\n",
      "A.   My place cannot be seen on this side.  It is on the left-hand side\n",
      "and my place was on the left-hand side in the corner.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Your Honour, I would tender this as Exhibit 254.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Any objection?\n",
      "MR. WLADIMIROFF:  No, your Honour.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Exhibit 254 will be admitted.\n",
      "JUDGE STEPHEN:  I wonder if you would tell the witness again to keep back\n",
      "from the microphone?\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Mr. Muslimovic, if I could ask you to move back a little bit\n",
      "from the microphones?  They are quite sensitive and they will be able\n",
      "to pick up your voice.\n",
      "Toward the latter part of your imprisonment in Omarska, did\n",
      "you manage to get into a room in the restaurant and away from room 15?\n",
      "A.   Yes, yes, I did, but only towards the end of my stay in the camp,\n",
      "towards the end of the hell that was taking place there.\n",
      "Q.   Did you do so because you had been told you were on a liquidation\n",
      "list?\n",
      "A.   Certainly.\n",
      "Q.   During the time you were in room 15 were prisoners regularly called\n",
      "out at night from your room?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Did many of them disappear after they were called out?\n",
      "A.   Many of those who were called out never returned to our room.\n",
      "Q.   What about those who did return, what was their physical condition?\n",
      "A.   Walking corpses, wounded, injured.  We cannot describe that, but we\n",
      "can just say a wounded man is returning.  We could not see which parts\n",
      "of the body were wounded, but he was walking like he had just been run\n",
      "over by a car.\n",
      "Q.   Were beatings a regular occurrence at Omarska, beatings of prisoners?\n",
      "A.   Every day.\n",
      "Q.   When would those things occur?  What would prisoners be doing when\n",
      "beatings would happen?\n",
      "A.   Would you please repeat the question?\n",
      "Q.   Sure.  Under what circumstances would those beatings take place?\n",
      "A.   They were called out, taken out and beaten up.  That was mostly late,\n",
      "in the late afternoon and then on through the night.\n",
      "Q.   What about during other times when prisoners were going to their meal\n",
      "or were going to the toilet?\n",
      "A.   Certainly, when we went to our meals that was the daily event.  If\n",
      "you got away without any beating, that was great luck.  When you went\n",
      "to the toilet, you had to keep from going because you never knew what\n",
      "criminal was there at the door. Daily, wherever you went out of the\n",
      "room, you expected to be beaten and if you were not beaten, that was\n",
      "just a piece of luck.\n",
      "Q.   You referred to going to meals.  What kind of food did prisoners\n",
      "receive when they went to meals?\n",
      "A.   They were given a meal a day, sometimes no meal, and most frequently\n",
      "the last inmates did not get anything, the first got something, so\n",
      "they returned without having anything.  The meal was the kind that I\n",
      "would never serve anybody, not even my greatest enemy I would not\n",
      "allow to eat that.  That is all.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Your Honour, I am about to move on to a new area.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Today we are going to adjourn at 5 o'clock so we\n",
      "will stand in recess though for 20 minutes.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Tieger, would you like to continue, please?\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Yes, your Honour, thank you.  Mr. Muslimovic, did you know\n",
      "anyone named Dule Tadic before the war?\n",
      "A.   No.\n",
      "Q.   While you were in Omarska did other prisoners point out to you a man\n",
      "they said was named Dule Tadic?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Had you ever seen that man before Omarska?\n",
      "A.   No.\n",
      "Q.   Were you beaten by this man in Omarska?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   On how many occasions?\n",
      "A.   I had two direct collisions with him.\n",
      "Q.   In addition to the beatings, did you see him in Omarska at other\n",
      "times?\n",
      "A.   Yes, several times.\n",
      "Q.   Where did you see him?\n",
      "A.   I saw him in front of the kitchen and in front of the white house.\n",
      "Q.   How many times did you see him by the kitchen?\n",
      "A.   About two times, I should say, twice, two or three -- twice, that is\n",
      "safer.\n",
      "Q.   Where were you when you saw him by the kitchen?\n",
      "A.   We were moving towards the kitchen.  We were going for lunch.\n",
      "Q.   How many times did you see him by the white house?\n",
      "A.   Also about two times.\n",
      "Q.   Where were you when you saw him by the white house?\n",
      "A.   At the window in the room in which I was.\n",
      "Q.   In May of this year did investigators show you a book of photographs?\n",
      "A.   Could you repeat the question, please?  I did not hear it.\n",
      "Q.   Of course.  In May of this year did investigators show you a book of\n",
      "photographs?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   At any time before you were shown the book of photographs, had you\n",
      "seen a picture of the person in camp you knew as Dule Tadic in any\n",
      "newspapers or television or from any other source?\n",
      "A.   No.\n",
      "Q.   Were you asked to look at the photographs in the book?\n",
      "A.   I am not getting the interpretation.  I do not hear anything.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.   OK.  You finally heard the question and you were asked to look at the\n",
      "photographs in the book.  Were you asked to see if there was anyone\n",
      "you recognised?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Did they tell you whose pictures were in the book?\n",
      "A.   No.\n",
      "Q.   Did you look at the photographs in the photo book?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   After looking at the photographs in the photo book had you seen the\n",
      "photograph of someone you were sure you recognised from Omarska?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Was that the person who beat you on two occasions and whom you had\n",
      "been told was Dule Tadic?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Did you sign and date the back of the photograph of the person you\n",
      "recognised?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   May the witness be shown which should be marked for identification as\n",
      "Exhibit 255?\n",
      "A.   May I have a look at it?\n",
      "Q.   Yes, please.\n",
      "A.   It looks like it.  Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Is this the book of photographs you were shown, Mr. Muslimovic?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Does your signature and the date appear on the back of the photograph\n",
      "you recognised?\n",
      "A.   I do not know.  I would have to take a look.\n",
      "Q.   Please do.\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Your Honour, I would tender 255 for admission.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  I understand there is a running objection to the use\n",
      "of the photospread book.\n",
      "MR. WLADIMIROFF:   Yes, your Honour.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  We will note that objection.  It will be overruled.\n",
      "Exhibit 255 is admitted.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER (To the witness):  Mr. Muslimovic, I would like to ask you\n",
      "about the first time you were beaten by this man.  Did that occur\n",
      "after an interrogation?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Where was the interrogation conducted?\n",
      "A.   In the room above the kitchen to the right.\n",
      "Q.   Were you beaten during that interrogation?\n",
      "A.   Yes, of course and quite a lot.\n",
      "Q.   When the interrogation was over what path did you take back to your\n",
      "room?\n",
      "A.   The same path that I got there, down the stairs and from the kitchen\n",
      "to the -- from the white house to the kitchen and then naturally\n",
      "upstairs to room 15.\n",
      "Q.   As you walked toward the entrance to the hangar, what happened?\n",
      "A.   Well, you know, each one of us looked for some comfort and trying to\n",
      "see someone, to greet someone, to say \"hello\" to someone.  Each one of\n",
      "us could be called out and not returned. Each one had his own story to\n",
      "tell, and I accompanied by blows from the kitchen, blows I received\n",
      "with an electric cord, I walked to the corner, what should I call it,\n",
      "a hangar, or a building, the one that is in front of me.  There I was\n",
      "for a while let alone.\n",
      "The guard went around me and came in front.  Of course, I had\n",
      "to follow him, but I took a glance.  My head had to be down but I did\n",
      "steal a look, and there were about five, six, 10 people in front\n",
      "there.  Of course I do not know how many because I did not dare look\n",
      "for longer, it was too dangerous, but you were looking for some\n",
      "comfort to save your life, then it is not as dangerous.  It is more\n",
      "dangerous when you know there is no escape.\n",
      "Of the people who stood there -- there were about five or six\n",
      "or seven of them, I did not count them -- I recognised Kecema, Dusko,\n",
      "or perhaps I thought that he could be the one who could perhaps help\n",
      "me to end as a dead man, but from what I could see he gave no sign of\n",
      "coming near me, coming to me, saying, \"How are you?  Where are you?\"\n",
      "or something.  He was just walking up and down.  When I saw that, I\n",
      "simply felt he would not help me.\n",
      "When I was near the door, not quite at the door but near it, I\n",
      "cast a last look, hoping that that man who I believed might help me,\n",
      "would do something, anything, but I could no longer see him.  He was\n",
      "not in the line of my eyes, and I only heard a man saying, \"Oh, well,\n",
      "I know this one.  He has got broad shoulders\" and he started towards\n",
      "me.  I hurried.\n",
      "Q.   Where was the group that Dusko Kecema was with?  Can you point it out\n",
      "with the long pointer?\n",
      "A.   (The witness indicated on the model).\n",
      "Q.   On that grassy area?\n",
      "A.   Correct.\n",
      "Q.   You may be seated.  Do you know who he was with at that time or did\n",
      "you see any of the people at that point who he was with?\n",
      "A.   Well, I used to see some of those people, of course.\n",
      "Q.   After the remark was made by someone that he knew this one who has\n",
      "broad shoulders and you hurried toward the hangar, what happened?\n",
      "A.   I started towards the hangar and I did try to hurry because somehow I\n",
      "did feel some danger was imminent and I reached the door, the entrance\n",
      "door to the staircase, not the room, but the staircase and there I\n",
      "felt a blow which made me fall down on my hands in the direction of\n",
      "the stairs.\n",
      "Q.   After you fell down in the direction of the stairs, what happened\n",
      "next?\n",
      "A.   I fell on my hands and I remained in that posture.  My hands and my\n",
      "feet were on the ground.  I was not lying down exactly, but I was like\n",
      "that, and he came from behind my back and got me by my hair and was\n",
      "pushing me left and right, shoving me left and right, and in this\n",
      "driving, I do not know what else to call it, I had to lift my hands\n",
      "and at one point I faced the exit doors from this area where the\n",
      "stairs were.\n",
      "Q.   So, after you first fell to your hands and knees, someone came from\n",
      "behind you and grabbed you by the hair and pulled you back?\n",
      "A.   Left and right, up and down, around, as if trying to shake\n",
      "something.  I do not know how to describe it.  He grabbed me by the\n",
      "hair.  He turned me to the right, to the left but very roughly, very\n",
      "strongly.  It was painful, of course.  After that shuffling right and\n",
      "left, up and down, I found myself facing the exit door but on my knees\n",
      "still.\n",
      "Q.   You said that he grabbed you by the hair, were you able to see who\n",
      "had grabbed you by the hair and did you recognise who that was?\n",
      "A.   Of course the gentleman on the picture.\n",
      "Q.   After you found yourself facing the exit door but still on your\n",
      "knees, what happened next?\n",
      "A.   At that moment I saw a man holding a beret.  My head was still pulled\n",
      "back so that I had to watch it, and it was right in front of my eyes\n",
      "---\n",
      "THE INTERPRETER:  Could the witness speak up a little, please?\n",
      "THE WITNESS:  -- and the man holding that beret ---\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Muslimovic ---\n",
      "A.   -- told me to kiss it.\n",
      "THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  -- would you speak up a little bit?  It is very\n",
      "difficult to know just how far; we tell you to move forwards and then\n",
      "we tell you to move back.  I have the same problem.  But speak up a\n",
      "bit and if you have a problem, let us know.\n",
      "THE WITNESS:  So I was staring at that beret.  There was a badge on it\n",
      "which we all knew.  I did not really try to see the colours and all\n",
      "that, but at that moment I saw a Kokarda.  I was ordered to kiss it,\n",
      "which I refused and after a little while, a kick from a person who was\n",
      "standing across me and holding this Kokarda hit me, so that simply as\n",
      "he hit me I fell against that Kokarda and it cut my lip, and I was\n",
      "bleeding.  This was  followed by a series of blows up and down, left\n",
      "and right.  You did not know where they came from.  The important\n",
      "thing was that you were receiving those blows.\n",
      "Q.   Do you know the name of the man who had the Kokarda and who kicked\n",
      "you?\n",
      "A.   I do not know his name.  I know his nickname was Saponja, but whether\n",
      "that was his real name or a nickname, I do not know.  I do not think\n",
      "that Saponja is a name, but I believe it is a nickname.\n",
      "Q.   After the series of blows following Saponja's kick to your mouth,\n",
      "what was the next thing that happened?\n",
      "A.   After the blow a series of blows followed and I received a blow in\n",
      "the head like this.  I could not see what it was, with what it was,\n",
      "but the blow was so strong that I stumbled forward.  I fell to that\n",
      "posture and I remained there because as I stumbled the most important\n",
      "thing was to hide one's head because everything else was less painful.\n",
      "But there were blows on my arms and everywhere, so that I was trying\n",
      "to protect my head slightly.  At one point I felt that my arms were\n",
      "blocked, that somebody was standing on my hands and I could not move\n",
      "either right or left.  Then a series of blows in the head followed and\n",
      "then some object was thrown.  I was not watching it, but I know it\n",
      "hurt.  Then it came against my back, so one expects it to hit you, but\n",
      "how that object reached my back I do not know.  At any rate, I was in\n",
      "this posture and there was this object, that thing falling down on me.\n",
      "Q.   Did you struggle to get away and were you successful?\n",
      "A.   Well, you know, a whole day of interrogation and beating you could\n",
      "not call it interrogation, beating, I really was powerless, but\n",
      "somehow I summoned up strength because I thought  it was the end, I\n",
      "thought I would not get out alive, that that is where my end would\n",
      "happen.  As they were still hitting me left and right and everywhere,\n",
      "somehow I managed to pull my hands...hands free and in this fury I\n",
      "managed to run up the stairs. I did it.  I did it.  I managed to get\n",
      "away and reach, I cannot understand how, but I did manage to reach the\n",
      "top of the stairs where there was a guard with a rifle aimed at me. I\n",
      "did not care any longer whether he would fire, perhaps it would have\n",
      "been easier.  I simply pushed him away.  At that moment I felt that it\n",
      "would be much easier for me if he fired because if I went back it\n",
      "would be the same.  As it was I thought it would hurt less.  So the\n",
      "door was open, well, I cannot say it was unlocked, neither it was\n",
      "closed, I think the door was ajar.  So, as I was thrusting forward, as\n",
      "I pushed him away I just got into the room, and that must have been\n",
      "some divine force, I do not know what it was, I cannot describe it. At\n",

      "back.  So that, I do not know how to put it, I stumbled, I staggered\n",

      "that is where I fell down.\n",
      "Q.   Did anyone follow you into the room?\n",

      "then I realised he was in, that he was in that room where we were.  I\n",
      "heard, \"Don't move, don't turn around, I will kill anyone who moves.\"\n",
      "Then the voices were getting further and furtherer away.  It was not\n",
      "as loud as when they were next to me, as the first moment it appeared,\n",
      "as sounding as if it was right next to me, and the door closed. I\n",
      "tried to stand up, to straighten up by this trough because that was\n",
      "not the place where I used to be before.  I did straighten up but I\n",
      "fell down again.  As far as I can remember, it was Mr. Alic, I believe\n",
      "it was Mirso Alic, I am not absolutely sure but I think it was him, he\n",

      "Q.   You mentioned that you heard a bullet.  Is that the sound of a bullet\n",
      "being fired or a bullet being chambered?\n",
      "A.   No.  I heard a regular being chambered, a rifle uncocked. Perhaps I\n",
      "said a bullet, but what I heard was a rifle being cocked.  Well, I\n",
      "guess the sound was very loud.  It sounded very loud.  It sounded as\n",
      "if it was right by my ear that sound.\n",
      "Q.   Approximately how long after this first beating did the second\n",
      "beating involving the man you knew as Dule occur?\n",
      "A.   It is very difficult to speak about time, but I think it must have\n",
      "been a week, not more than that, perhaps a day or two more or less,\n",
      "but about a week.\n",
      "Q.   Were you in room 15 that day?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   About what time of the day did the incident occur?\n",
      "A.   It happened late in the afternoon.  It was still light, but I did not\n",
      "have a watch.  I do not know the date.  It was impossible to remember.\n",
      "I could not be bothered really. I simply did not want to think, but\n",
      "it was late in the afternoon and it was still daylight.\n",
      "Q.   Was a prisoner called out from your room?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Who was that?\n",
      "A.   Emir Beganovic.\n",
      "Q.   After Emir Beganovic was called out could you hear the sounds of a\n",
      "beating coming from downstairs?\n",
      "A.   Sounds reached that area where I was, but not so loudly, not as if it\n",
      "was in the next room or in my room.  They came from the outside.  One\n",
      "could hear them.\n",
      "Q.   Sometime after that were you called out?\n",
      "A.   True.\n",
      "Q.   Where was the voice that was calling you out coming from?\n",
      "A.   From the entrance door.\n",
      "Q.   Did you leave the room and did you get up and go toward the entrance\n",
      "door?\n",
      "A.   Not the first time, but the second time when the same voice came I\n",
      "had to.\n",
      "Q.   Was there a Serb soldier outside the door when you left the room?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Was there another Serb waiting for you down the stairs?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Where was that person?\n",
      "A.   That man was stood at the bottom of the stairs, perhaps a metre, half\n",
      "a metre.  Generally speaking, he was standing by the  stairs.\n",
      "Q.   What was that person wearing?\n",
      "A.   All I remember is the white belt, the white belt and military uniform\n",
      "naturally, but this white belt stuck in my mind.\n",
      "Q.   Did you go downstairs?\n",
      "A.   Of course.\n",
      "Q.   Did the man with the white belt stop you or let you pass initially?\n",
      "A.   No, at that moment when I came near him he let me pass by and stayed\n",
      "behind my back.\n",
      "Q.   What happened next?\n",
      "A.   I turned right, it was two or three steps, so I started and there was\n",
      "a man with a rifle who said, \"No, no, there\", and immediately a blow\n",
      "from the back followed and then so on and so forth, I was accompanied\n",
      "by blows.  From the left and from the right, I did not know where they\n",
      "were coming from.  You had to cover your head to protect yourself, so\n",
      "you protected yourself up there and then they hit you below.  So there\n",
      "were blows from the entrance door.\n",
      "THE INTERPRETER:  Could the witness please speak up or come closer to the\n",
      "microphone?  We barely here him.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Mr. Muslimovic, I will ask you to move your chair a little\n",
      "closer to the microphone again, if you do not mind.  Were you hit or\n",
      "pushed toward the hangar?\n",
      "A.   I was a bit struck.  The strongest ones were in the back and those\n",
      "were the ones who pushed me.  That was from the left, from the right\n",
      "and then one from the back, so that I had to stagger forward.  That is\n",
      "how the blows directed me to this door, not towards the exit but\n",
      "towards the interior.\n",
      "Q.   When you got to the interior part of the hangar, that is the hangar\n",
      "floor, what happened?\n",
      "A.   I did not enter, that is putting it very mildly.  Under those blows\n",
      "there was force which directed me that way.  Then came questions, not\n",
      "questions but orders, \"Take off your jacket\", so I took off my jacket\n",
      "which was of a coffee colour. I gave it to the person who had met me\n",
      "at the stairs and, of course, he began to search through it, to frisk\n",
      "it.  It was not much, but he began to look there and he was cursing\n",
      "and saying, \"Where's your money?\" and curses and filthy language.  I\n",
      "was not thinking much about that.  I was wondering whether they would\n",
      "hit me again.  I felt and I saw this jacket.  It was low and my head\n",
      "was down, but I was trying to look like this, and I felt how this\n",
      "jacket was thrown away as if behind the back. There was nothing in it\n",
      "for sure.  Then questions ensued, \"Where's your money? What kind of a\n",
      "mortar do you have?\" and things like that.  I mean such provocative\n",
      "questions that you just look at him, I mean, you know, someone asks\n",
      "you, \"Where's your tank?\"  I mean you cannot hide a tank.  It was like\n",
      "that. It was so incredible.  If he had asked me some normal questions\n",
      "perhaps I might have thought about them, but the questions were such\n",
      "that there was nothing you could reply.  So you just kept silent and\n",
      "question was accompanied, was followed by a blow.\n",
      "Q.   Was there a group of Serbs there at that time?\n",
      "A.   Of course.  Not in a group, but when you are hit and your head goes\n",
      "right or left or up and down and every time it moves you are bound to\n",
      "see somebody.  They were all over, in front and behind and to the\n",
      "left, because whenever he hit you you could not keep your posture, you\n",
      "changed simply the posture.  Whenever you looked they were there.\n",
      "Q.   What were they beating you with, what sorts of objects?\n",
      "A.   Rifles, electrical cords, soldiers' boots which was very, very heavy,\n",
      "perhaps heavier than the gun, a baseball bat.  This is what I could\n",
      "see and feel on my back.\n",
      "Q.   At some point did you end up held against a dumper tyre?\n",
      "A.   Yes, true.\n",
      "Q.   How did that happen?\n",
      "A.   After this series of blows which followed, mostly from the gentleman\n",
      "with white slings and white belt, and others too of course but more\n",
      "often than not from that gentleman, I could not see anything.  You\n",
      "hear, but you just do not see.  All is dark, all is black.  I do not\n",
      "know what to call it, but at that moment I did not see anything\n",
      "regardless of whether I had my eyes open or not.  I heard again a\n",
      "noise, shouts, but I could not understand, I could not distinguish.\n",
      "When I realised that I was able to see something around me, I was\n",
      "already straightened up and I could not fall down because my arms were\n",
      "in that position and fixed.  So I assumed I had been tied because it\n",
      "was impossible for a man to stand like that.  My head was bent down.\n",
      "As the seconds were passing by I was recovering my consciousness more\n",
      "and more and I realised that I was tied to a tyre which was bigger\n",
      "than I.  I did not turn to see what kind of a tyre it was.  I could\n",
      "not.  One could see while hit that it was a tyre.\n",
      "Q.   What happened after you were held against that tyre?\n",
      "A.   Well, it was always accompanied by blows, a series of blows and\n",
      "noise, curses, always swearing at mother, at religion, and they were\n",
      "practising blows.  I was just a bat they used to practise blows.  They\n",
      "practised them until I lost consciousness again.\n",
      "Q.   What kind of blows did they practise?\n",
      "A.   They were mostly blows, how shall I say, I do not know how to put it.\n",
      "Most of the blows were with the foot, mostly with a foot.  Naturally\n",
      "some came with a rifle or some with a bat, but they were mostly kicks\n",
      "with the foot, from the right and from left, and they hurt most here\n",
      "from the chin downward.  Those were the kicks that I felt best.\n",
      "Everything else somehow I could endure easier than those kicks.\n",
      "Q.   Were the kicks from any particular person the strongest?\n",
      "A.   Must be because those were the ones that I felt most and that they\n",
      "hurt most.  I thought somehow when he hit me here I felt them in the\n",
      "back, as if they went right through.  If somebody came with a rifle,\n",
      "that was fine with me.  That was really very nice for me as compared\n",
      "with that kick.  I mean, the word \"fine\" is not perhaps the best word,\n",
      "but I somehow felt easier when hit with the rifle or anything else\n",
      "than that.\n",
      "Q.   Who was it whose kicks were the strongest and most effective?\n",
      "A.   The gentleman whom I recognised in the picture.\n",
      "MR. TIEGER:  Should I continue your Honour?\n",

      "ordered me to put my hands behind my back, so my wife and I put\n",
      "our hands behind our backs and they cuffed our hands.\n",
      "Then my wife started crying and said, \"What do I do wrong?  We\n",
      "both are orphans.\"  I was so pitiful of my wife.  At that time,\n",
      "they used a piece of black cloth to blindfold both of us, my wife\n",
      "and I.  Then we were walked into the S-21 Security Office or Tuol\n",
      "Sleng prison.  Then I realized that was a prison.  From then\n",
      "onward, I was asked to enter a room and I was photographed.\n",
      "After they photographed my wife, then they photographed me, and\n",
      "that was the only photograph of my wife that I have had with me\n",
      "until today because I lost all the photos from the 7th of January\n",
      "1979.  And with me I only have a photo of my wife that I would\n",

      "that time onward, I separated from my wife.  I did not know which\n",
      "building she was taken to.\n",
      "So I was placed in the common room on the upper floor.  I think\n",
      "about five months or one year later, I received torture.  First,\n",
      "I was threatened that they would peel my skin.  I didn't know\n",
      "what it means by that, but a person who slept next to me told me\n",
      "that it means that you will be beaten during the interrogation\n",
      "and I felt so horrified in my mind.  I was so shocked.  I\n",
      "thought, what mistake did I make?  I tried my best to serve\n",
      "Angkar.  And in the end, I became and fell into such a situation\n",
      "so I kept thinking.\n",
      "While I was in the prison, all the clothes were stripped off\n",
      "except my underwear.  So I slept directly on the floor for\n",
      "several months.\n",
      "Then they started to interrogate me and beat me up.  It was --\n",
      "the interrogation location was in a house outside the compound.\n",
      "It was behind the Building A.  They cut me and they asked me to\n",
      "lie down on the floor with my face facing down and they had a\n",
      "bunch of sticks and they dropped it on the floor and it made\n",
      "noise.  And I was asked to choose which stick I preferred.  And I\n",
      "responded, \"Whichever stick I choose, it is still a stick that\n",
      "you will use to beat me up so it is up to you, Brother, to decide\n",
      "which one you want to use.\"\n",
      "Mam Nai stood up and grabbed a stick and started to beat me up.\n",
      "After he felt exhausted, then another person came to take turn to\n",
      "beat me up.  So that Mam Nai was Mam Nai alias Chan.  He got his\n",
      "skin condition with a spotty skins and quite a red in his face.\n",
      "He asked me to count the lashes and when I counted up to 10\n",
      "lashes, he said, \"How come you count to 10 lashes?  I only beat\n",
      "you for one lash.\"\n",
      "I was -- I felt so painful at the time.  There were wounds --\n",
      "many wounds on my back and the blood was on the floor flowing\n",
      "from my back.  Whips were also used to torture me.  I was so\n",
      "shocked and painful.\n",
      "Every time they beat me up, they asked me questions; when did I\n",
      "join the CIA and, \"Who introduced you into the CIA network and\n",
      "what was their name?\"  And I responded that I did not know.  So\n",
      "the first beating, I responded I did not know.  The second time\n",
      "of the beating, the third times; I gave the same response.  Even\n",
      "if my back had wound, they beat on that wound.  It was so painful\n",
      "and I could not think of any mistake that I made.  I did not know\n",
      "what CIA or KGB network was; then how could I respond?  So they\n",
      "just kept beating me up.  I had a lot of scars on my back as\n",
      "evidence from that torture.\n",
      "In my mind, I thought of my mother; that if I could live, I would\n",
      "pray.  Probably it's because of my mother that gave me birth.\n",
      "And I would -- and I thought that if I could lived to give my\n",
      "story to the Chamber and now, finally, I am before the ECCC and\n",
      "that the ECCC would  find justice for me.  And I feel so happy\n",
      "even if 100 percent of justice cannot be provided by the Chamber,\n",
      "50 or 60 percent of justice to me is fine because I determined\n",
      "from the prison where I was detained that I had not committed any\n",
      "mistake or offence and that I prayed just to be survived.\n",

      "public and the Chamber who are participating in this proceeding\n",
      "or the Cambodian people as a whole as well as the international\n",
      "community to hear, to understand the acts committed by the Khmer\n",
      "Rouge clique on you and that they would express the pityness on\n",
      "you as you received those ill treatment from them.  So do not let\n",
      "your emotion overwhelm you.  So try to grab the opportunity to\n",
      "tell your accounts to the Chamber as well as to the public.\n",
      "Uncle Meng, do you understand what I said?\n",
      "A. Yes, Mr. President; I understand.\n",
      "Q. Please try to recompose and be strong.  Today is the\n",
      "opportunity for you to reveal, to describe your sufferings to the\n",
      "Chamber so that the Chamber can understand.  If your emotion\n",
      "overwhelms you, then it's unlikely that we have another time to\n",
      "hear your account because the Chamber has scheduled other\n",
      "witnesses to provide the testimonies and they had gone through\n",
      "similar experiences, either at S-21 or Prey Sar -- although some\n",
      "of them are not the direct victims but they're relatives or\n",
      "family members, wives, husbands, parents -- received the unjust\n",
      "acts over there.\n",
      "So, in summary, please continue to recount the experience and the\n",
      "sufferings that you received from those unjust acts during the\n",
      "time that you were detained until the day you were free from that\n",
      "prison, thanks to the National United Front for Salvation armies\n",
      "on the 7 January '79.  Do you understand what I said?\n",
      "A. Yes, I can continue, Mr. President.\n",
      "Let me go back a little bit because I forgot to talk about the\n",
      "food ration in the common room.  In that common room, there were\n",
      "about 30 or 40 of us and at one corner I saw foreigners with\n",
      "light complexions and they were detained there as well, and they\n",
      "received the same food ration; that is, very thin gruel.  There\n",
      "was no rice grain in there, just one (inaudible) or one there,\n",
      "and I was so skinny I had no strength.  Even if I had a stick, I\n",
      "would not be able to use it to attack them.\n",
      "When Him Huy took me to the upper floor, he rode on my neck, on\n",
      "my shoulder, and I stumbled on the stairs and my knee was hurt\n",
      "and there was a wound on my knee.  So when I think of those\n",
      "events, I felt so painful.\n",
      "Each day when they took me for interrogation they took me twice,\n",
      "from 7 to 12 in the morning, and in the afternoon from 2 to\n",
      "or \n",

      "names.\n",
      "They were Brother Mam Nai, Comrade Hor, Comrade Huy, Comrade Tith\n",
      "and Peng, so there were five of them altogether.  My apology that\n",
      "I went back to describe this account because I forgot.\n",
      "Q. As I told you, please try to re-compose yourself.  This is the\n",
      "day that you have been waiting for for so long.  I know you are\n",
      "very emotional now and probably you will miss certain events that\n",
      "you would want to recount.  Of course, the sufferings you and\n",
      "your wife received were indescribable and right now the Chamber\n",
      "would like to ask you some questions.\n",
      "When there was a vehicle going to pick you up from the Ta Lei\n",
      "Co-operative in Dangkao district to the School of Fine Arts, were\n",
      "you tied or cuffed, and what about your wife?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, Your Honours, at that time I saw a vehicle but\n",
      "there were no cuffs in there.  We were asked to pack our clothes,\n",
      "so I had some clothes so I put them in my backpack and they were\n",
      "all taken away at Tuol Sleng.\n",
      "Q. When they took you to Tuol Sleng, did they take you to Tuol\n",
      "Sleng straight away or were you taken to another place first?\n",
      "For example, like the place that you described where there were\n",
      "two rows of chairs.  Was it within the compound of the Tuol Sleng\n",
      "prison?\n",
      "A. It was outside the Tuol Sleng prison.  It was opposite the\n",
      "Tuol Sleng prison.  There was a house and there were two rows of\n",
      "chairs, and in the middle there was a long table.  So we were\n",
      "asked to enter that house and they ordered us to put our hands\n",
      "behind us and then they cuffed our hands, both of us.\n",
      "Q. When they ordered you to put your hands behind your back and\n",
      "then later you were cuffed, did they tell you the reasons for the\n",
      "arrest of your wife and yourself?  Did they tell you the reasons?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, at that time they did not tell us any reasons\n",
      "or any mistakes we made, and I and my wife asked them what\n",
      "mistake did we do and we told them that we were orphans and what\n",
      "mistakes we did?  And they replied, \"You, the contemptible, you\n",
      "don't have to ask.  Angkar has many eyes, like pineapples, and\n",
      "Angkar only arrests those who make mistakes or offence.\"  And I\n",
      "was still wondering what mistakes I did, and my wife wondered the\n",
      "same.\n",
      "At that time. I was in the adult group in the co-operative to\n",
      "make ploughs and rakes, and my wife worked in the rice fields and\n",
      "I could not think of any mistake that my wife and I made.  Until\n",
      "today, I could not think of the mistakes that I made at the time.\n",
      "Q. The people who ordered you to put your hands behind your backs\n",
      "and then they cuffed you and your wife, were they the same people\n",
      "who went to pick you up from Ta Lei Co-operative?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, they were different people.  They were not\n",
      "those who took me, who brought me from the co-operative.  They\n",
      "were there waiting for us in that room.  So once we entered the\n",
      "house we were asked to sit, in a nice gesture, and later on what\n",
      "happened I already described to you.\n",
      "So I broke into my tears because I did not know what offence I\n",
      "committed.  If I stay home and did nothing, maybe I made a\n",
      "mistake, but I did not do that and I cannot think of the mistake\n",
      "I committed.  Whatever I was asked by Angkar, I just did.\n",
      "Q. Can you recall the day that you were arrested and taken to\n",
      "Tuol Sleng prison or can you recall the year?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I can remember the year.  It was 1977 when I\n",
      "was entered into the S-21 Office.  I am a bit weak on the month\n",
      "because at that time there was no calendar to see, so it's only\n",
      "just based on the thinking or estimation.  I think it could be in\n",
      "May or June in 1977.\n",
      "The reason why I thought it was in May or June because after they\n",
      "tortured me and they were fed-up with torturing me, there was a\n",
      "teenager about 16 or 17 years old made an announcement.  He said,\n",
      "\"In this room, who can do the painting?\"  So I raised my hand.  I\n",
      "said, yes, I can do the painting.\n",
      "And that person ordered another person to unshackle me and they\n",
      "then put a chain on one of my feet.  I was then walked from the\n",
      "upper floor of that C Building to the ground floor in order to\n",
      "meet Mr. Duch.  The reason I recognized him because when I was\n",
      "painting the portrait of Pol Pot, he was sitting nearby me,\n",
      "watching me, sitting on a chair with his legs crossed.  I did a\n",
      "lot of portraits, not only just for Pol Pot, I also did a\n",
      "portrait for Mao Zhedong.\n",
      "Q. The Chamber asked you to describe about the situation but you\n",
      "have not been able to detail what we asked you, so I would like\n",
      "you to please listen to the question of the Chamber step-by-step\n",
      "until the 7th of January 1979.\n",
      "I think would you please wait until the question is referred to a\n",
      "particular section that you can respond otherwise you would not\n",
      "be able to recall the consequential event.  So could you please\n",
      "be waiting for the question from the Chamber before you could\n",
      "respond to them?\n",
      "When you were arrested and sent to S-21, were you sent in at\n",
      "night or in the daytime?\n",
      "A. It was at about 9 or 10, I can't remember it well, and when I\n",
      "reached Tuol Sleng there was no clock that I could check the\n",
      "time, but it was during the daytime not at night.\n",
      "Q. When you were handcuffed all together with your wife and\n",
      "walked into Tuol Sleng compound, were you both blindfolded?\n",
      "A. We were blindfolded before we were walked into Tuol Sleng\n",
      "compound.\n",
      "Q. You stated earlier that when you entered the location you were\n",
      "taken photograph.  Before the photos were taken, did they ask you\n",
      "for your biography or was it done later after the photography?\n",
      "A. I don't remember all.  Please accept my apologies.\n",
      "I think the document from Tuol Sleng still survives and the\n",
      "person who kept the record was Ti (phonetic), and I was shocked\n",
      "and confused because I did not know why I was arrested and I did\n",
      "not know how I responded to them.  I did not know whether my\n",
      "biography would have been sent to them earlier, prior to my\n",
      "arrest.  I'm not sure.\n",
      "Q. You said your wife and yourself were blindfolded.  Were you\n",
      "still being blindfolded while being taken photograph or were the\n",
      "blindfolds removed?\n",
      "A. When we were at the photo workshop then our blindfolds were\n",
      "removed, and we were seated and I was taken photograph and\n",
      "followed by my wife.\n",
      "Q. What about the handcuffs?  Were you removed from the handcuffs\n",
      "while being photographed?\n",
      "A. I don't recall having been removed from the handcuffs.  I'm\n",
      "not sure; I forget it.  Maybe the handcuffs were removed or maybe\n",
      "they were not.  But so far as I remember after our photographs\n",
      "were taken, then we were blindfolded again before we were walked\n",
      "to Building C.\n",
      "Q. You said you were stripped to your underwear.  When was that,\n",
      "before you were sent to Building C or only after you got to\n",
      "Building C that your clothes were stripped off?\n",
      "A. I think maybe my clothes were stripped off downstairs before\n",
      "we were walked upstairs or maybe only when we reached upstairs\n",
      "that our clothes were stripped off.  I seem to forget.  But as I\n",
      "remember, it is sure that after we were taken photographs then we\n",
      "were re-blindfolded and I did not know where my wife would be\n",
      "walked to.\n",
      "Q. When you reached the building, it was the common building for\n",
      "all prisoners or it was a separate prison cell for detaining you\n",
      "alone?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, at that time I was put in a common large room\n",
      "in which about 20 to 30 detainees were placed.  They all looked\n",
      "like hell because their hairs grew long, even they were male but\n",
      "their hairs grew so long.  I felt dizzy when I entered the room\n",
      "and I was so confused.\n",
      "Q. When you were being handcuffed, were you handcuffed and\n",
      "attached to the bar, the metal bar with the other detainees, or\n",
      "you were handcuffed and then isolated?  Could you please tell us\n",
      "about the condition of the shackles?\n",
      "A. We were put into the common rooms and in each metal bar\n",
      "resembled the shackles.  There were a lot of detainees attached\n",
      "to the shackles by our ankles, maybe five to 10 people for each\n",
      "long shackles and we were put to sleep head to head with other\n",
      "detainees, so my head was put against the east wall.\n",
      "Q. At that time could you sit up when your both legs were\n",
      "shackled to the long bar like that?\n",
      "A. I could sit up but we had to ask permission from the guards\n",
      "before we could relieve ourselves, although we were given an\n",
      "ammunitions box for such purpose and we were given a plastic jug\n",
      "for our urination.\n",
      "Q. Who collect the wastes or were they left with the detainees\n",
      "all day?\n",
      "A. At that time the people who worked there in the common cell,\n",
      "the person whose age was about 15 years old, would go up and\n",
      "collect the waste because the detainees would only be put to lie\n",
      "down in the cell and could not be moved.\n",
      "Q. You mentioned about the food ration, the thin gruel with very\n",
      "few rice grains and sometimes you would be offered a watery soup\n",
      "with water grass.  The question is how food was provided to you?\n",
      "Were you fed with a plate, a spoon or what was it like when food\n",
      "was delivered to you, and how often did you get the meals?\n",
      "A. When it was time to eat it was at 12 or 11.30; let's say\n",
      "between 11.30 to 1.  That's for lunch.  In the afternoon, late\n",
      "afternoon, the food was served at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. and when the\n",
      "food was carried to the place then they would leave it there, and\n",
      "if people made noise then they would be beaten with the stick\n",
      "that they used to carry the food to the detainees.  I felt very\n",
      "pity for them and for myself because we were treated like\n",
      "animals.  We whispered to one another, I mean to the neighbours,\n",
      "but we could not make loud noise.\n",
      "Q. Did the detainees have to share -- have to distribute the\n",
      "porridge or the gruel, or were they distributed by the guards?\n",
      "A. We were given the gruel on a plate by the guards, and after we\n",
      "finished the meal then the plates and spoon would be collected\n",
      "because they were afraid that those items could be used for the\n",
      "detainee to commit suicide, because every night people would come\n",
      "to search for any metal items or sharp items.  I did not know why\n",
      "they came to search for those items.\n",
      "Q. When you were thirsty what would you do?\n",
      "A. We had to ask for permission; for example, \"Brother, I am\n",
      "thirsty.  Could you please give me some water?\"\n",
      "Q. So it means in the common cell there were the prison guards\n",
      "who stationed there regularly.  Is that correct?\n",
      "Please wait until you see the red light before you respond.\n",
      "A. When I needed some water I would ask them for the water and\n",
      "they would give it to me.\n",
      "THE INTERPRETER:\n",
      "The President's mic is not on.\n",
      "BY MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. Now, you have not answered the questions about the guards who\n",
      "would be regularly stationed at the cell, and you said that when\n",
      "you would like to relieve yourself or you were thirsty you would\n",
      "ask the guard.  My question was:  were there regular prison\n",
      "guards at that location, and how many guards were there in your\n",
      "room?\n",
      "A. I think guards would be seen walking on the corridor, several\n",
      "of them, because we were locked inside and we could see them\n",
      "walking on the corridor, passing the windows.  And when we needed\n",
      "to relieve ourselves then we would call them.  But they gave us\n",
      "the boxes for relieving ourselves, although we were not removed\n",
      "our shackles.  But I seem to be forgotten when it comes to how we\n",
      "could ask them when we would like to relieve ourselves, but I am\n",
      "sure that we were shackled at all times.\n",
      "Q. I think we learned from you that there were the plastic jug\n",
      "and ammunition box placed for the detainees to relieve\n",
      "themselves, but when you were thirsty how could you do it,\n",
      "because there were no water jars left with water for detainees,\n",
      "so you had to shout to the guards?  I mean, if you shouted it\n",
      "means that the guards would be outside but if they were inside,\n",
      "the detainees would not need to shout to alert them.\n",
      "However, during the time when you had a bath -- because you were\n",
      "detained quite a long time from mid-1977 to 1979 and you were\n",
      "detained the longest there among the others, so when it comes to\n",
      "having a bath, what was it like?\n",
      "A. When we had a bath we would take off our shorts and then\n",
      "remove it from our legs, one leg at a time, and then we had to be\n",
      "naked and then the water would be sprayed from outside through a\n",
      "water hose, and some would get soaked, some would miss the water.\n",
      "And then we would use the clothes to dry the water.  It was so\n",
      "miserable because we would -- had been treated like the cattle\n",
      "while we were sprayed the water on.\n",
      "When we asked for water, of course we had to ask them for\n",
      "permission.  Otherwise we would never be given such water to\n",
      "drink.\n",
      "Q. You said you took off your shorts to dry the water.  What was\n",
      "the purpose of doing so?\n",
      "A. We only used them to dry the floor so that we could -- when\n",
      "the floor dried then we could lie down, because the water floods\n",
      "the floors and we had to dry it to make sure that it's dry.\n",
      "Q. So the purpose of removing your shorts was to dry the floor so\n",
      "that you could sleep on it.  Is that correct?\n",
      "A. That is correct, Mr. President.\n",
      "Q. How often were you sprayed the water on like this?\n",
      "A. Once every week or maybe once every fortnight.  I don't\n",
      "remember; you know, it has been 30 years or more already, but I\n",
      "know that every time we had a bath, everyone had to be naked.  It\n",
      "was like hell.\n",
      "Everyone would look the same and sometimes they mocked at us.\n",
      "They said that you guys look small physically but your thing was\n",
      "not that small.  I'm sorry to say that, but we would laugh by\n",
      "mocking on some other things, private things.\n",
      "Q. When you were detained, besides being removed from the\n",
      "shackles to be interrogated, were you released to do exercises,\n",
      "for example, every now and then or were you never allowed to do\n",
      "that?\n",
      "A. I don't remember it.  I think we were never allowed to do\n",
      "exercise in the room or maybe we were allowed to do so.  I am not\n",
      "sure because it has been so long already.\n",
      "Q. When you were taken to be interrogated, how was the process\n",
      "carried out?\n",
      "A. Every time I was taken to be interrogated, they would handcuff\n",
      "me and walked to the compound of the prison to Building A.  I\n",
      "think the previous trace of the building vanished over time and I\n",
      "think I could never take any visitors to the same original\n",
      "location as it already altered.\n",
      "Q. When you were removed from shackles, then you would be\n",
      "handcuffed before you would be walked to be interrogated.  Can\n",
      "you please tell us how this process would be carried out?\n",
      "A. I was walked to the interrogation room into the house.  We\n",
      "walked to upstairs.\n",
      "Q. No, I'm talking about the time when you were in the room and\n",
      "were shackled, and then you were shackled and attached to other\n",
      "people, other detainees.  And before you were taken to the\n",
      "interrogation room, would you be removed from the shackles and\n",
      "then walked outside of your room before you would be re-shackled\n",
      "again and walked to the interrogation room?\n",
      "A. They removed the shackles from the long bar.  The shackles\n",
      "were removed then they cuffed -- they put the cuffs on me again\n",
      "and then they walked to the outside area of the room, or the\n",
      "prison.\n",
      "Q. Were you blindfolded when you were being walked away?\n",
      "A. Of course, I was blindfolded while I was being walked away.\n",
      "Q. Could you please tell us about the moment when you were put\n",
      "into the room for interrogation?  How were you treated by the\n",
      "guards?\n",
      "A. They treated us -- they used derogatory language to me and\n",
      "they shackled me by my ankles -- the long bar of shackles which\n",
      "was about half a metre -- and then they locked the chain and then\n",
      "they closed all the windows and doors.  No, I think the windows\n",
      "would be left open because there were metal bars.  I could see\n",
      "Building A or B clearly.\n",
      "After I was shackled and they removed the handcuffs and removed\n",
      "the blindfold, and then they started to beat me to answer when I\n",
      "entered CIA and KGB.  I told them that I did not know anything\n",
      "about it and I could not answer anything about CIA and KGB.\n",
      "I kept repeating my response and they kept beating me and, of\n",
      "course, if we did not respond or answer to satisfy their request,\n",
      "then we would be beaten severely.\n",
      "Q. During the time when you were interrogated, you would be\n",
      "shackled and then you would be asked to sit on the floor while\n",
      "your handcuffs would be removed along with the blindfold before\n",
      "you would be interrogated.  In case you did not respond to what\n",
      "they wanted to get the confession from you, then you would be\n",
      "beaten with a stick.  Do I understand you correctly?\n",
      "A. They removed the blindfold and handcuffs.  They put me to lie\n",
      "face down and then they started to beat me until they had enough,\n",
      "and then they kept asking me when I entered CIA and KGB and who\n",
      "introduced me into the agents.  And I did not know how to respond\n",
      "to them because the person who worked honestly and worked the\n",
      "best to serve Angkar and never been involved in such\n",
      "organization, how could I respond to them that I introduced\n",
      "anyone into the CIA, even myself.  I did not know what CIA was.\n",
      "Q. You said you were shackled and put face down.  I find it\n",
      "difficult to understand because if you talk about the shackle,\n",
      "then you could sit up.  And how could you be put face down and\n",
      "then if you were shackled before that, you could not sit up\n",
      "because it was a wooden kind of shackles.  Then you put your legs\n",
      "-- or your legs were put into the shackle then you would not be\n",
      "able to lie face down on the floor.\n",
      "Or were you put to lie face down on the floor and tortured before\n",
      "they removed the shackles, and then -- or what?  Could you please\n",
      "clarify it to me or to the Court?\n",
      "A. It was not a wooden shackle, Mr. President.  It was a metal\n",
      "bar, long bar, designed to only put on one individual detainee.\n",
      "After having that long metal bar attached to my legs and my\n",
      "ankles, then they locked both ends and then they put me to lie\n",
      "face down in order for the interrogator to be able to beat me on\n",
      "my back and I could put my face down.\n",
      "Q. Were you taken to be interrogated immediately when you were\n",
      "sent during the first night at S-21 or were you kept a few days;\n",
      "only later that they would take you to be interrogated?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I was detained for quite a long time.  I think\n",
      "it was until May or June 1977 so I had been detained for four or\n",
      "five months before I was interrogated and tortured.  And as I\n",
      "stated earlier, then a guy came and asking for anyone who could\n",
      "paint.\n",
      "Q. Can you try to recall the S-21 staff who took you for\n",
      "interrogation and torture?  How many times were you taken and\n",
      "what about the types of torture?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, when -- for every times they interrogated and\n",
      "tortured me, they did not use or change the method.  First, they\n",
      "used a rattan stick or a whip to beat me up.  They beat me up\n",
      "with the stick or the whip for the two sessions.  So from 7 until\n",
      "1\n",
      "or 1 p.m. in the morning, then I was allowed to eat and in the            2   afternoon, they only stopped after 6 or 7 p.m. when I was taken\n",
      "back to the room.  After they beat me up, they did not take me to\n",
      "the common room.  They took me to the individual cell.  So every\n",
      "time after the interrogation and the torture, I was taken to the\n",
      "ground floor -- to the individual cell.  And for the mealtime,\n",
      "then we were fed with a bowl of food.\n",
      "Q. So in summary, you were detained in two different rooms.\n",
      "First, you were in the common room and about five months later,\n",
      "when they started to interrogate and torture you by using the\n",
      "stick, then you were detained in an individual cell.  Is that\n",
      "correct?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, that is correct.\n",
      "Q. Was your torture in a different method; for example, by\n",
      "electrocution?\n",
      "A. Yes, Mr. President.\n",
      "One day after they beat me down -- they beat me up, they walked\n",
      "me to Building D and there was a power outlet on the wall and\n",
      "then they used an electrical wire to electrocute me.  I felt\n",
      "unconscious and later on they used the water to pour on my face\n",
      "and I became unconscious again.  I did not know the voltage of\n",
      "that electricity, but once they started it, I felt unconscious\n",
      "immediately.  That was done in Building D.\n",
      "Q. I already asked you and you said that you did not know if you\n",
      "committed any offence so when you were detained in the prison,\n",
      "was there any decision by a trial committee to punish or sentence\n",
      "you -- for example, in a form of a trial in a similar form of\n",
      "this Chamber -- during your detention there?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, no, there was no judgment; no order from\n",
      "anybody.  We were just detained.  And one day after they\n",
      "exhausted by beating me up, then they walked me back into the\n",
      "room and while at the path walking to our Building D -- there was\n",
      "no concrete path there at the time  -- and at that juncture, I\n",
      "was beaten up again.  And another person came and said, \"Don't\n",
      "beat him up today because Brother instructed so.  Keep him\n",
      "alive.\"\n",
      "Because there were a lot of wounds on my back, I felt so painful,\n",
      "but because they beat me up so I had to lie down on my back.\n",
      "However, Him Huy used a stick to push under my back and a lot of\n",
      "gravels went inside the wound on my back so because it was so\n",
      "painful, then I had to turn myself again for them to beat me up\n",
      "on the back.\n",
      "Q. When did they decide to use you as a painter?\n",
      "A. One day, I was taken from that individual cell to the upper\n",
      "floor for treatment.  Actually, there was no medicine at all.\n",
      "There was a bowl of saltwater and they just poured that saltwater\n",
      "on my back and it was so, so painful because of my open wounds\n",
      "and the salt.  You could see when you used the salt on the frog,\n",
      "you could see the effects and you could imagine how painful it\n",
      "was when they pour the water -- the saltwater on my back.  And\n",
      "indeed, finally the wounds recovered from the saltwater.\n",
      "Sometimes, I was given a rabbit pellet tablet.  It was so\n",
      "miserable.\n",
      "Q. And now to the scars from the beating; do you still have the\n",
      "scars or are they completely gone?\n",
      "A. The wounds recovered, but the scars are everywhere on my back,\n",
      "on my shoulders.  They were the scars from being whipped or\n",
      "beaten.  Sometimes, there were five of them beating me up at the\n",
      "same time.\n",
      "Q. Can we see the scars on your back?\n",
      "MS. STUDZINSKY:\n",
      "Mr. President, I would like to make break now before Mr. Bou Meng\n",
      "shows his scars and to decide if this is appropriate -- an\n",
      "appropriate measure now and maybe it is time for an adjournment,\n",
      "and that would be great if he could get it.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Now it is time for a break.  The Chamber will take a 20 minute\n",
      "break until 11 a.m. when the Chamber will resume.\n",
      "(Judges exit courtroom)\n",
      "(Court recesses from 10H38 until 11H02)\n",
      "(Judges enter courtroom)\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Please be seated.  The Chamber is now back in session.\n",
      "We would like to inform the parties and the public that the\n",
      "Chamber now cancels its attempts to show the scars on the\n",
      "survivor's back and all parties are also reminded not to proceed\n",

      "to do.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "The Chamber already decided to cancel its attempts to show the\n",
      "scars, even if in an in camera hearing.  In case of necessity, it\n",
      "can be shown by photos.  So the photos can be shown of the scars\n",
      "on his back.  Bou Meng, you think you can have those photos for\n",
      "the Chamber?\n",
      "MR. BOU MENG:\n",
      "Mr. President, I do not have any photos of the marks.  I only\n",
      "have the marks on my body.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",

      "you agree to this proposal?\n",
      "MR. BOU MENG:\n",
      "Yes, I agree.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. Next, so you were chosen to be a painter.  When were you\n",
      "chosen?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, towards the later '77, because in early 197\n",
      "I  \n",
      "          8   already painted a canvas.  One day I heard the noise from the\n",
      "loudspeaker, I think they celebrated something at the Olympic\n",
      "Stadium, and we were given a lot of food.  We ate to our fill and\n",
      "the guards gave us the food.  And I even have the noodles,\n",
      "Chinese noodles to eat.\n",
      "And Nath said I had to jump, to jump up so that the food will go\n",
      "down lower through my stomach and I can eat more to fill to my\n",
      "stomach.  And I told him, \"Once you are full, you are full.  You\n",
      "only have one stomach to fill in.\"\n",
      "I think I started painting the portrait in late '77 or early '78\n",
      "because there were four portraits and each portrait, when Duch\n",
      "asked me, \"How long did it take to make that portrait?  And the\n",
      "portrait must look the same as the photo,\" and I told him -- I\n",
      "requested to have three months to make that portrait because the\n",
      "canvas was huge.  It was 1.5 metres wide and three metres high.\n",
      "I would like to seek your permission to show the portrait of Pol\n",
      "Pot that I painted.  I survived because I could paint the exact\n",
      "portrait of Pol Pot, so I was spared until to the 7th January,\n",
      "'79.\n",
      "This is my response, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. During the time that you were released to work by doing the\n",
      "painting, where did you paint and who else worked with you in\n",
      "that location?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, yes, I myself, Bou Meng; Vann Nath too; Im\n",
      "Chan, the wood sculptor and the wax moulder, another wax moulder;\n",
      "so that's all.  And we worked in Building E.  Building E is the\n",
      "building in the middle of the compound.  I think that is used as\n",
      "the reception area for the guests who come to visit the museum.\n",
      "Q. What about the food ration after you were chosen to work as a\n",
      "painter?  Was the food ration the same as those given to the\n",
      "prisoners?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, the food ration was better than previously, so\n",
      "it was from the thin gruel to rice and we had sufficient soup.\n",
      "So the prison guard carried the soup to deliver it to us and we\n",
      "shared among ourselves.\n",
      "Q. During the time you were selected to work as a painter, where\n",
      "were you allowed to sleep at night?\n",
      "A. After I painted and when it was time to sleep, it was at the\n",
      "generator's room.  It was behind Building E.  At that time there\n",
      "was a generator there, so when the electricity was cut off, then\n",
      "they started the generator and we slept in that generator's room.\n",
      "Q. Were you cuffed or shackled in that room or were you locked\n",
      "from outside?\n",
      "A. I was allowed to sleep in that room but I was not cuffed or\n",
      "shackled, so there was seven of us -- Oeng Bech, Vann Nath, Im\n",
      "Chan, Pha Tha Chan, Ruy Makong.  There were seven of us -- and\n",
      "Chum Mey.  I requested to see the photo: Pha Tha Chan, Bou Meng,\n",
      "Vann Nath, Im Chan, Ruy Makong and Chum Mey.  And now only Chum\n",
      "Mey, Vann Nath and Bou Meng are alive.  The other four died.\n",
      "MS. STUDZINSKY:\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to suggest to the Court\n",
      "officials to show the photo on the screen.  Thank you.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "I don't think it is yet your time.  It is now my question and I\n",
      "have the discretion.\n",
      "BY MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. During the times you were asked to do the painting, did you\n",
      "meet the accused, Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, Your Honours, at that time Mr. Kaing Guek Eav,\n",
      "alias Duch, sat next to me watching me painting the portrait of\n",
      "Brother Number One, Pol Pot, and he ordered me, \"You should\n",
      "adjust the throat.  It's not a tumour, it's just fat.\"  So as can\n",
      "be seen from this photo which was taken of the portraits that I\n",
      "painted, so you could see that the throat was slimmer.\n",
      "Q. Did he come to visit you often to see you painting?  And if he\n",
      "came, during the day or nighttime?\n",
      "A. He came often during the daytime and he wore shorts and a\n",
      "short-sleeved shirt.  So he came in, he sat with his one leg\n",
      "across and watching me drawing, for example, another portrait of\n",
      "the head of Ho Chi Minh on the body of a dog.  It was like a\n",
      "cartoon which they -- it was like a sketch of the sea with a\n",
      "flat, windy situation, et cetera and et cetera.\n",
      "Q. Did you notice his character and behaviour during the time\n",
      "that he watched you making the painting or the portrait?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, he did not really beat me up, however, one day\n",
      "I didn't know what I did wrong.  He asked me and Im Chan to beat\n",
      "each other up.  So we were given a piece of black plastic tube to\n",
      "hit, to beat each other, and he sat there watching us beating\n",
      "each other up.  After a while he ordered us to stop.\n",
      "But if I could make a very lifelike portrait, he would look at it\n",
      "carefully and I think I lost some of the portraits.\n",
      "Q. The question is, did you observe his facial expression or his\n",
      "behaviour; that is the behaviour of the accused, Kaing Guek Eav,\n",
      "alias Duch, during the time that he went to watch you painting?\n",
      "Was he a person full of joy or full of sorrow?  Did you notice\n",
      "that?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, his facial expression was normal.  If he needed\n",
      "to laugh, he laughed.  Sometimes he smiled.  I could see him\n",
      "through his face but I could not judge his feeling or emotion,\n",
      "and that's the word I was asked especially by a journalist, and I\n",
      "always tell them, \"I know his face but I don't know his feeling\".\n",
      "He was close to me, observing me painting.  Sometimes he gave me\n",
      "cigarettes to smoke.\n",
      "Q. Did he ever beat you up personally?\n",
      "A. No, but he ordered me to beat up with Im Chan.  I was not\n",
      "happy with that.  He did not treat me like a human being.\n",
      "Q. Did you ever see him going from one building to the next\n",
      "within the compound of the prison; for example, from Building A\n",
      "to B to C, or did he only enter the compound and only come to the\n",
      "place where you worked?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I did not see him walking along each building\n",
      "because when he entered his main focus was on the portrait of\n",
      "Brother Number One, Pol Pot.  I only saw him coming to my\n",
      "workshop.  I did not see him going anywhere else.\n",
      "Q. So besides him, besides you yourself, did you see him\n",
      "torturing or beating up other prisoners?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, let me go back a little bit.\n",
      "One day there was a Vietnamese citizen.  He boasted that he could\n",
      "make a wax mould and then he was ordered to show his skill.  So\n",
      "he was tested and Duch saw that he could not do it.  Then he\n",
      "ordered the interrogators to kick him like kick a ball because,\n",
      "from what I understood, he was angry that that person lied to\n",
      "him.  And I did not know what happened to that Vietnamese person.\n",
      "Probably he was taken out.\n",
      "Q. Did he himself order the guards or his subordinates to torture\n",
      "that person?  And if he did order, can you recall his exact\n",
      "words; that is, the words that Duch used to order his\n",
      "subordinates to torture that Vietnamese person?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I forget some parts.  I am not sure.  I think\n",
      "probably he signalled his guards to beat that Vietnamese person.\n",
      "And the Vietnamese person was taken away from the workshop where\n",
      "I worked.  So there were woodcrafters; there was a painter and\n",
      "another artist.  We worked in the same workshop.\n",
      "Q. You saw the guards beating up that person who boasted about\n",
      "his skill.  Was the beating taking place within the workshop\n",
      "vicinity in Building E or was he taken out and beaten up outsides\n",
      "that area?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, at that time the three or four of them kicked\n",
      "that Vietnamese person and beat him up and walked him away.  I\n",
      "did not hear his order.  So when those guards beat the Vietnamese\n",
      "person up, Duch had already left.\n",
      "Q. So during the time you were asked to work as a painter, how\n",
      "many portraits did you paint and whose portraits were they?\n",
      "A. There were four portraits of Pol Pot.  However, there was\n",
      "another portrait in 1981.  There was a German group to make a\n",
      "film on that portrait, so I showed the portrait to the person and\n",
      "then I used paint to make a cross sign on that person to express\n",
      "my hatred of that person, and that was filmed by the German\n",
      "group.\n",
      "Q. You said that you painted various other paintings or\n",
      "portraits; for example, a painting of a dog with the Ho Hi Minh\n",
      "head on it.  But for Pol Pot portraits you only made four\n",
      "portraits?\n",
      "A. That is correct, Mr. President.\n",
      "Q. So besides the portraits of Brother Number One, Pol Pot, did\n",
      "you make any other painting or portrait?\n",
      "A. Mr., President, yes, I painted Hua Guofeng, Mao Zhedong in\n",
      "large canvas as well, so the canvas was as big as the canvas for\n",
      "Pol Pot's portrait.\n",
      "Q. When you did your painting or portrait, did you do it\n",
      "individually or together with Vann Nath?  That is, Vann Nath was\n",
      "painting his own painting or portrait and you yourself had a\n",
      "separate painting or portrait?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, at that time he did not have a skill of\n",
      "painting black and white portraits so I mixed the black and white\n",
      "painting by myself with one litre of gasoline to burn it and the\n",
      "smoke would go into that painting and then I mixed it.  And Vann\n",
      "Nath did not have this skill.\n",
      "Q. So it means that your painting was separate from him because\n",
      "one was colour and one was black and white.  Is that correct?\n",
      "A. Yes, that is correct.\n",
      "Q. You talked about the portrait of Pol Pot.  This is one of the\n",
      "portraits of other people that you painted.  Is that correct?\n",
      "A. Yes, Mr. President, that is correct.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",

      "Q. Is this the portrait of Pol Pot that you painted by yourself\n",
      "during the time that you were detained there and then when you\n",
      "were asked to make a drawing or portrait of the leader of the\n",
      "Democratic Kampuchea?\n",
      "A. Yes, Mr. President, this is the portrait.\n",
      "Q. You stated just then that because of your skill of making the\n",
      "portrait that you survived until today.  Can you explain further\n",
      "the reason of this portrait that led to the survival?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, the reason, from my understanding, is that my\n",
      "painting is a resemblance of the photo, so I started painting\n",
      "portraits 1, 2, 3 and 4 and another one.  While I was painting,\n",
      "then the time came when the Vietnamese and the National United\n",
      "Front for Salvation army entered Phnom Penh and we fled.\n",

      "you were sent to Prey Sar and then you stayed at Prey Sar for a\n",
      "while before you were returned to S-21.  What happened back then?\n",
      "Is it true that you were sent there?\n",
      "A. I think it is not true because I stayed in Tuol Sleng prison,\n",
      "but when we were evacuated it would be true that I was walking\n",
      "and reached Prey Sar somewhere near Boeung Choueng Ek for about\n",
      "five minutes, and then we later on were ordered to move to Prey\n",
      "Sar prison.  I think after about 10 to 20 minutes then we would\n",
      "be ordered to move further during the nighttime.\n",
      "Q. So you went to Prey Sar during the evacuation process when the\n",
      "United Front of the National Army actually liberated Phnom Penh,\n",
      "and you went along with the other people, so you were forced to\n",
      "move out with other people.  Is it correct?  I think you were\n",
      "leaving on the 7th of January 1979; is that correct?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, it's correct, we left at night in the late\n",

      "please tell us about the date during the process you were\n",
      "marching or you were getting out of town that time?\n",

      "Road Number 4, and at dawn we saw the presence of the United\n",
      "Front army, and the guards who guarded us all the way while we\n",
      "were on our journey then left us.  And I could proceed with Pha\n",
      "Tha Chan and I did not know where the other people went to\n",

      "reached Pursat province.  And Vietnamese troops would be seen in\n",

      "person disappeared and would be buried.  I don't know where he\n",
      "would be buried or discarded because I was still shackled and I\n",
      "didn't know more about something outside.\n",
      "Q. You were detained and shackled for a long period of time\n",
      "before you were let out to be a painter.  And have you noticed\n",
      "the people who were sent in and shackled along with you in the\n",
      "same room would be taken out and disappeared or had they returned\n",
      "or have you noticed that?\n",
      "A. I'm talking before the God, the Buddha.  I'm talking the\n",
      "truth.  People would be put into the trucks and carried away and\n",
      "they never returned.  And after being interrogated, I would be\n",
      "kept downstairs and I did not know much about the fate of those\n",
      "people, but when I was in the common room, people who would be\n",
      "taken away would never come back so they just disappeared.\n",
      "Q. What about the other situation, for example, when a detainee\n",
      "was so weak that he would be carried to the truck or to the other\n",
      "location?  Had you seen such scenes?\n",
      "A. I did witness the very thin person who were tied to his legs\n",
      "and arms, and a stick would be put to -- and then carried by two\n",
      "people.  He was carried like a pig, like people would be carrying\n",
      "a pig, and he was passing the place where I was painting, and the\n",
      "guard banged the door shut in order not to let me see them\n",
      "carrying that very sick and thin detainee.  I did not know where\n",
      "he was up to.\n",
      "Q. Were they carrying the dead body or a person who's still\n",
      "alive?\n",
      "A. He was not yet dead.  He was still breathing and then he would\n",
      "be carried onto the truck waiting outside the prison.  We could\n",
      "hear the sound of the truck coming in and out all day long.\n",
      "Q. I think you should have known about this, about the trucks\n",
      "that came and take people away all night.  Can you tell us\n",
      "whether the trucks only came during the night or during the\n",
      "daytime, or detainees would be taken by the trucks at any time\n",
      "from S-21?  I mean, those people who would be taken away and\n",
      "would never return.\n",
      "A. I was in the common cell or common room.  After being\n",
      "interrogated, I was put in the cell and I could hear the sound of\n",
      "the trucks.  I never saw the trucks; just heard the sound, the\n",
      "noise.  I did not know or see the detainees.  I only saw him once\n",
      "when I was painting the portrait of Pol Pot while they were\n",
      "carrying him, passing me.\n",
      "Q. So was it at night or during the daytime?  I'm asking this\n",
      "because after hearing testimony we have received two different\n",
      "kinds of information, especially concerning the transportation of\n",
      "detainees to Choeung Ek, because the information we obtained so\n",
      "far is that detainees would only be sent during the night.\n",
      "Another thing is that I don't know whether you're confused among\n",
      "two of you.  One witness who testified said that during the time\n",
      "he was detained at the location from the morning until 12 p.m. he\n",
      "would not be able to sleep because he wait until 12 p.m. passed\n",
      "so that he knew that no people would be carried away to be killed\n",
      "after that.  So that's why I would like you to clarify whether\n",
      "prisoners would be taken at night or in the daytime, especially\n",
      "regarding the person who was very sick and would be carried away\n",
      "by two people with a stick.  Was it done during the day or at\n",
      "night?\n",
      "A. At that time I did not see at night, of course, but I saw it\n",
      "during the daytime.  It was about 9 or 10 a.m.; I think more or\n",
      "less at about nine, between 9 and 10 a.m.\n",
      "Q. Normally when the trucks came, were the trucks driven to\n",
      "Building E or just they were parked right in front of the\n",
      "entrance; close to Building B or C, for example?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, regarding the trucks that transported the\n",
      "detainees, the truck parked outside under the gate -- I mean near\n",
      "that gate.  The truck did not come into the compound of the\n",
      "prison.  They parked outside.\n",
      "Q. Did you notice other activities of the staff at S-21 towards\n",
      "other detainees?\n",
      "A. When I was painting at Tuol Sleng, I saw female detainees.\n",
      "Some pregnant detainees would be walked away while being kicked\n",
      "by the guards -- female guards.  And they asked them to walk\n",
      "faster and they walked past Building B and then -- I mean from\n",
      "south to north, from Building A to B.  I did not know where they\n",
      "would be detained, but they passed us while we were painting the\n",
      "portraits.\n",
      "Q. The last question.  When you left with Uncle Nath and other\n",
      "survivors from S-21 on the 7th of January\n",
      "1979, did you notice \n",
      "          19   that in the buildings of S-21 there were some prisoners left?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I think it is more about freedom of the\n",
      "prisoners.  Prisoners were deprived of their liberty and we would\n",
      "not be allowed to move, so people -- I think there was quiet\n",
      "inside.\n",
      "Q. My question is this.  I mean the last day, the last day when\n",
      "you left S-\n",
      "21, because there were dead bodies on the beds.  There            2   were 14 of them.  Some witnesses would say that there were only\n",
      "10; the accused said that there were only four people; and now\n",
      "the survivors, including you yourself, have noticed that there\n",
      "would be some kind of noise and could see people were still left\n",
      "inside the building during the time when you were leaving the\n",
      "premises.\n",
      "The question is whether you could receive any information or see\n",
      "that detainees still were there on the 17th (sic) of January\n",
      "1979, the moment before you were leaving S-21.  So just tell us\n",
      "whether you saw people still there at the premises when you were\n",
      "leaving.\n",
      "A. Mr. President, the last day on the 7th of January I left S-21\n",
      "at about 9 a.m.  We heard the gunshots and we were ordered to\n",
      "leave immediately.  At that moment I did not see or hear any\n",
      "noise, and I was so panicked that I did not pay attention to who\n",
      "would remain, because they pointed the guns at us and they warned\n",
      "us not to even turn back.  We had to really walk forward\n",
      "otherwise we would get killed or shot.  So I did not see any one\n",
      "I guess.\n",

      "Thank you very much, Uncle, for your responses.\n",
      "And it is now time to make an adjournment for lunch.  So the\n",
      "Chamber will now take adjournment, and we resume at 1.30 p.m.\n",

      "Q. Uncle Meng, when the interrogators stopped torturing you\n",
      "because you agreed to confess and it was a false confession, was\n",
      "it based on the purpose in order to satisfy the interrogators, or\n",
      "you survived because of your skill as a painter?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, regarding the torture inflicted upon me --\n",
      "after they still couldn't extract the confession from me because\n",
      "I gave the same response every day, and because I did not know\n",
      "who was the leader or who introduced me into the CIA or KGB, they\n",
      "kept beating me up every day.\n",
      "And because they could not get my confession, they took me to the\n",
      "building which is now where you can purchase the ticket to visit\n",
      "the museum.  I was asked to sit there and they wrote a false\n",
      "confession and ordered me to sign.  I can not recall the content\n",
      "of that confession, it's been so many years now, and also because\n",
      "of the serious torture inflicted upon me my memory was not good.\n",
      "And at that time, if my memory was like I am now, I would not be\n",
      "able to paint the portrait and I would not survive because during\n",
      "that time if they thought somebody lied, especially lying to\n",
      "Angkar, then that one would be dead.\n",
      "Q. During the time that they decided to use you as a painter to\n",
      "paint the portraits of the leaders, including Brother Number 1,\n",
      "Pol Pot, and other leaders including the Chinese leader as you\n",
      "stated, what happened during the times that you did the painting?\n",
      "For instance, were you detained again as a prisoner?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, no.  During the times that I did the painting I\n",
      "worked every day regularly so it took me a long time to complete\n",
      "the four portraits.  That was after I had been tortured.\n",
      "Q. Until now, can you try to remember or recall, besides the\n",
      "serious torture inflicted upon you with the present scars on your\n",
      "back until today, was the situation of receiving torture\n",
      "physically or emotionally, did it happen elsewhere?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, if you talk about my memory, I am very\n",
      "forgetful now.  My memory is not as good as when I was young.\n",

      "Judges of the Bench, do you have any questions to be put to Uncle\n",

      "Judge Cartwright, you take the floor.\n",
      "JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President.\n",
      "BY JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:\n",
      "Q. Mr. Bou Meng, you were at S-21 for a very long time and you\n",
      "have described your suffering and your experiences there; thank\n",
      "you for that.  But I have just one or two small questions to ask\n",
      "you.\n",
      "I want to know something about other prisoners whom you might\n",
      "have seen at S-21.  You have talked about the people who were in\n",
      "the same room shackled as you were.  You have spoken of seeing\n",
      "some pregnant women being kicked by female guards and told to\n",
      "walk more quickly.\n",
      "Did you see any foreigners at S-21, other than the large number\n",
      "of Vietnamese soldiers that you have described?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, the inmates in the common room where I was\n",
      "detained, there were some foreigners.  I was not sure of their\n",
      "nationality, whether they were European, American or Australian.\n",
      "They were detained in the same common room as I was detained, and\n",
      "they had the same food ration as I received.\n",
      "Q. Were you aware of any foreigners other than westerners or\n",
      "Vietnamese, such as Thais, people from Thailand?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, I did not see any Thai citizens.  I only saw\n",
      "Vietnamese people and some foreigners.  They were tall, they had\n",
      "bright eyes, and sort of bronze hair.  Besides that I did not see\n",
      "any other nationality, including Thai.\n",
      "Q. In addition to the Vietnamese soldiers, whom you saw, did you\n",
      "see any ordinary Vietnamese people; that is people who were not\n",
      "soldiers?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, yes, I saw civilian people.  They were not\n",
      "soldiers.  And I saw these one civilian, as I said earlier, he\n",
      "said he knew he was a real artist, but when Duch ordered him to\n",
      "test, to make the mould and he couldn't do it, and, of course, at\n",
      "that time Angkar was not happy -- was not happy of anybody lying\n",
      "to Angkar.  And I don't have anything else to say regarding this\n",
      "question.\n",
      "Q. The people whom you think might have been westerners, and the\n",
      "ordinary Vietnamese people whom you saw, were they all treated\n",
      "the same way as you were?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, for the prisoners the treatment was not the same.\n",
      "For example, I, myself, I received very serious torture, so only\n",
      "I, myself, knew clearly about what happened to me, and I cannot\n",
      "say about what happened to other inmates.\n",
      "Q. Did you see many children at S-21?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, for children at S-21, I did not see any of them\n",
      "walking around or detained there.  I only saw those children in\n",
      "the photos, but I did not see them personally during the time of\n",
      "my detention.  This is my frank and honest response.\n",
      "Q. Did you ever hear the sounds of children around S-21?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, for the sound of children, I did not hear.  I\n",
      "only heard the screaming, asking for help of the adult people\n",
      "while I was in the common room.  And while I was in the\n",
      "individual room, individual cell, I also heard the screaming, but\n",
      "the screaming of the adult, not the children.\n",
      "JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:\n",
      "Thank you very much, Mr. Bou Meng.\n",
      "Mr. President, I have no further questions.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Judges of the Bench, do you have any questions?\n",
      "Judge Lavergne, you take the floor.\n",
      "BY JUDGE LAVERGNE:\n",
      "Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Bou Meng.\n",
      "I also have a few questions to ask you, to try to clarify what\n",
      "you already explained in detail to the Chamber earlier on today.\n",
      "I think I understood through what you said this morning, and\n",
      "through what I have read in your testimony, that your life was\n",
      "essentially impacted by many sacrifices, and by a life of\n",
      "obedience.  And you said this morning that you answered Prince\n",
      "Sihanouk's call in 1970 to free Cambodia, to liberate Cambodia.\n",
      "Is that so?\n",
      "A. At that time, I heard the appeal of the Prince Sihanouk on the\n",
      "radio broadcast.  I was not sure which broadcast was it.  He\n",
      "appealed for his children to go to the maquis forest to struggle,\n",
      "so I decided to enter the maquis forest in 1971 with another\n",
      "friend from K25 office.\n",
      "So we went to the maquis forest to make some sketches and drawing\n",
      "of Marx and Lenin.  I was the one who drew the pictures of Marx\n",
      "and Lenin.  And those sketches were stencilled and distributed to\n",
      "various units in order to understand the supreme leaders of the\n",
      "Communists -- of the Communist country.  There were five of them\n",
      "all together: Karl Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mao Zhedong.  So I even\n",
      "drew the sketches of these people on the cloth.\n",
      "Q. So you worked there for the -- at the services of the\n",
      "Communist Party of Kampuchea's propaganda.  You were very\n",
      "respectful of what you were requested to do.  And then between\n",
      "the end of your activity with the propaganda services and your\n",
      "job at the Orussei Technical School, did you do anything else\n",
      "between; was there another episode in your career?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, let me correct that.  It was called the Russei\n",
      "Keo Technical School, not Orussei Technical School.\n",
      "Q. Did you go directly from the propaganda services to the Russei\n",
      "Keo Technical School or did you do anything in between?\n",
      "A. In between that time -- in order to make it easier to\n",
      "understand, let me go back. First, I worked for the Ministry of\n",
      "Commerce, of State Commerce,  and Koy Thuon was the Prime\n",
      "Minister at the time.  I was requested to draw placards for a\n",
      "boat.  It was called Marinal Transport.  And I made some other\n",
      "placards and signs and boards for those boats and vehicles while\n",
      "I was there.\n",
      "Q. Well, back then did you trust the CPK entirely?  Were you\n",
      "somebody who was very much obedient, who would follow what you\n",
      "were being told to do?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, that was my specialty, the skills that I had.  I\n",
      "knew that the evacuation of people from Phnom Penh disappointed\n",
      "me because I struggled, I was so sick with malaria, and in the\n",
      "end I received such a suffering which is indescribable.  I felt\n",
      "so regretful for such inhumane acts of leadership which did not\n",
      "satisfy my willing -- my understanding.  I physically served them\n",
      "but emotionally I did not, although I wore black shirt, but my\n",
      "mind was not black.  I did what I was instructed, based on my\n",
      "skill.\n",
      "This is my response, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. Was there a specific moment where you might have entirely lost\n",
      "trust in the CPK?  Was there any moment when you said to yourself\n",
      "that what you might have believed in did not correspond to\n",
      "reality?\n",
      "A. I don't really understand your question.  Can you rephrase\n",
      "your question again and please try to be simplified and make it\n",
      "short?\n",
      "Q. Well, can we say that when you were working for the Russei Keo\n",
      "School and when you worked previously for the propaganda\n",
      "services, that you trusted the CPK and Angkar?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, I carry out the task based on the assignment from\n",
      "my superior, including drawing the sketches of the machines or\n",
      "for the new parts of the machines.  Everything was done based on\n",
      "the instructions from the chairman of that technical school.\n",
      "This is my response, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. You explained that your superiors at the technical school had\n",
      "been arrested and that you yourself had been sent to be\n",
      "re-educated.  At that moment, was your trust in the CPK -- was it\n",
      "-- did it change or did you still have full trust in the CPK?\n",
      "A. At that time, Your Honour, I lost my trust because my\n",
      "performance in carrying out the assignment was excellent, I did\n",
      "what I was asked, but I could not understand why I was\n",
      "transferred to be re-educated at the Ta Lei Co-operative.  I was\n",
      "disappointed and this is my frank response to you.  I no longer\n",
      "had my trust.\n",
      "Q. But, however, despite the difficult conditions in which you\n",
      "were, you continued obeying and you continued following the\n",
      "orders that were given to you.  Is that why it was particularly\n",
      "difficult for you to understand why you had been arrested by\n",
      "security cadres of the CPK?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, at that time, I myself and some other people\n",
      "totalling about 10, were transferred from the Russei Keo\n",
      "Technical School to Ta Lei Co-operative and I did not know the\n",
      "reason for the transfer.\n",
      "However, before the transfer we were instructed to make our\n",
      "biography, as I can recall, so I made my biography to the Angkar\n",
      "and about one or two months later I was transferred to the Ta Lei\n",
      "Co-operative amongst about 10 other people, including my wife.\n",
      "So we were tempered to do hard labour at the Ta Lei Co-operative.\n",
      "I did not know the reason for the transfer, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. Back then, had you heard of the security centres?  Were you\n",
      "aware, for example, of the existence of S-21 or of other security\n",
      "centres?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, regarding the security offices or the prisons, I\n",
      "did not hear anything at all during the time, however, people\n",
      "kept disappearing.  Some probably were sent for re-education or\n",
      "sent for training here and there.\n",
      "I had heard a lot about transferring of people or relocation of\n",
      "people starting from\n",
      "1976, and I was wondering how come, while \n",
      "          19   people were still working good and they were transferred\n",
      "elsewhere?  Or whether they had any plan of transforming in the\n",
      "agriculture production?  I only had doubt in my mind, however, I\n",
      "just kept doing what I was given or instructed.\n",
      "So I typed some documents that I was asked to do and I drew\n",
      "sketches for the students to study.  I could not understand their\n",
      "thinking.  They were in a higher class and I thought I belonged\n",
      "to the lower class with limited technical capability.\n",
      "Q. Can we say that you were not at all aware of having committed\n",
      "any kind of offence that you absolutely were not aware having\n",
      "betrayed the CPK, that you had absolutely no awareness of being\n",
      "part of a group of traitors?\n",
      "A. When I came I knew that there was a Minister of Propaganda,\n",
      "Mr. Ho Nim, who\n",
      "called me to draw a portrait of the embarkment structure.  And at\n",
      "that time the current king was teaching students how to perform\n",
      "the ballet dancing and then he told me to help draw a portrait of\n",
      "his father.  And he called his father the normal, ordinary\n",
      "person's language and I was surprised but I did not ask further\n",
      "questions.\n",
      "Probably they saw the picture, the photo that the king asked me\n",
      "to draw; that's why they arrested me, or not.  I'm not quite\n",
      "sure.\n",
      "Q. This morning, you also talked, at length, about the\n",
      "ill-treatment that was inflicted upon you.  You also talked about\n",
      "the physiological consequences thereof.  You also said to us that\n",
      "you still had scars.  I seem to have understood that these\n",
      "tortures led to other consequences, such as problems with your\n",
      "hearing.  Do you have other physiological conditions or\n",

      "that ill-treatment?\n",
      "A. I was slapped and I was beaten on the head; all kinds of\n",
      "tortures had been inflicted on me.  So in short, I believe that\n",
      "because I was severely tortured, that I look older than my age\n",
      "and I lose all the teeth, and I can observe that Brother Chum Mey\n",

      "I look much older than I am and if you compare to the age, I\n",
      "think I should have not been that old if I was not tortured.\n",
      "Q. From what you can remember, do you have the feeling that the\n",
      "people interrogating you were enjoying themselves by making you\n",
      "suffer or seeing you suffer?\n",
      "A. During the time when I was being interrogated some people ate\n",
      "the jackfruit and they threw the remaining -- the peel of the\n",
      "jackfruit onto my head and I could feel like then I was perceived\n",
      "as enemy and prisoner.  I could not do anything but to let them\n",
      "do whatever they wish and they did not show any mercy towards me\n",
      "as a human being.  And whenever I recall it, I cannot hold back\n",
      "my tears.  I was so disappointed that I had devoted myself for\n",
      "the work and after all I end up being tortured.  I wished I were\n",
      "killed by the malaria in the jungle, but I think my life was\n",
      "valuable that I could survive longer to be tortured again.\n",
      "That's all, Your Honour.\n",

      "having been taken out of the workshop in relation to an incident?\n",

      "and apologize?\n",
      "A. I don't know whether the apologies were made to my colleagues\n",

      "or tied up and led to go and offer apologies to either your\n",

      "Q. Good afternoon, Uncle Bou Meng.\n",
      "I have a few questions to be put to you.  Regarding the food\n",
      "ration, was it enough?\n",
      "A. The food ration, during the time when I was detained, was\n",
      "inadequate.  But when people were looking for someone who could\n",
      "paint and when I came out to work as the painter with Vann Nath,\n",
      "with Kong, with Pha Tha Chan and Bech, the food was adequate.\n",
      "But it was inadequate when I was still in the prison.\n",
      "And there would be other documents to support my arguments about\n",
      "this condition.  You may refer to it.  Thank you.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "When you were being detained at S-21 in the common room and in\n",
      "the individual cell, you said that the food ration was\n",
      "inadequate.  How could you fulfil your hunger?\n",
      "A. There was no substitute.  I was so hungry.  When I saw the\n",
      "lizard crawling on the ceiling I would wish that it dropped down\n",
      "so that I could grab it and eat to fulfil my hunger.  I told\n",
      "myself that I did not know what kind of bad deeds I committed\n",
      "previously that I would be treated like this without enough food,\n",
      "without enough water, and I was questioning myself and I was\n",
      "asking myself what kind of mistakes I had committed that I would\n",
      "end up being here.\n",
      "And I was thinking of karma and I did not even recall any\n",
      "mistakes.  But then Angkar would say that Angkar had multiple\n",

      "Have you ever seen or known that at S-21 the practice of blood\n",
      "drawing took place -- I mean blood drawing from detainees?\n",

      "BY MR. KONG PISEY:\n",
      "Q. Good afternoon, Uncle Bou Meng.  My first question is the\n",
      "follow-up question concerning the earlobes, your earlobes.  You\n",
      "said that you received tortures onto the earlobes -- no, the ears\n",
      "as a whole, and you said you had a hearing problem.\n",
      "I would like to ask whether now you can listen to people and your\n",
      "ears are okay, or you need a hearing aid to assist you with the\n",
      "hearing?\n",
      "A. The Court officials have helped me and taken me to the\n",
      "hospital specializing in hearing and then they offered me a\n",
      "hearing aid.  I now can hear better.  If I use my bare ears to\n",
      "listen to people talking I would not be able to listen or to\n",
      "understand their conversation unless I paid very close attention,\n",
      "or move very close to them.  So if I could put number one to 10,\n",
      "I could hear about 30 percent.  I mean three out of 10 because of\n",
      "my impairment.  And I think my eyesight were not good.  My teeth,\n",
      "also, are not good.\n",
      "Of course, when people get old, this kind of thing will get old\n",
      "as well, but you know, like, Chum Mey is still young, and I am\n",
      "older than my age because I had been tortured, otherwise I would\n",
      "be ok now.  And my ears would have not been that bad.  So here --\n",
      "I can sit here, I cannot even listen to you if you talked over\n",
      "there.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  My next question.\n",
      "I want to know about your suffering.  How long had you endured\n",
      "this suffering or you still feel the suffering at the present\n",
      "time?\n",
      "A. Are you talking about the suffering, the physical suffering,\n",
      "in addition to the emotional suffering?\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  I meant regarding your earache.  So you suffered\n",
      "when they tortured you.  Are your ears in a better condition now?\n",
      "A. They are fully recovered, however, I have had hard hearing.\n",
      "So that's why I need the hearing aid so that I could hear\n",
      "properly.  Without the hearing aid, I could hardly hear anything.\n",
      "That's all.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  Regarding the electrocution, as you stated that\n",
      "they used the wall power outlet to electrocute you.  You said you\n",
      "were electrocuted near your genitals.  How far was the spot where\n",
      "it was electrocuted?\n",
      "A. It was to the inner side of my thigh.  So once I was\n",
      "electrocuted, I fell unconscious immediately, and when I gained\n",
      "my consciousness, the water was everywhere on my face.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  Did they place the wire on your pants or on your\n",
      "flesh directly?\n",
      "A.  It was placed on my shorts, however, there was a machine that\n",
      "I think it controlled the voltage, and that machine hooked into\n",
      "the power outlet from the wall.  So I think they could increase\n",
      "the voltage from that machine.\n",
      "But you could easily understand that if the voltage was not\n",
      "strong enough, then I would not fall unconscious.  That's it.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  You already informed the Chamber that once you\n",
      "were electrocuted, you fell unconscious straight away.  And for\n",
      "how long did you become unconscious?\n",
      "A. If you are unconscious, it's like you were sleeping.  You\n",
      "would not know how long you fell unconscious.\n",
      "Q. On another matter, did you go and make consultation with the\n",
      "psychological support?\n",
      "A. Previously, I have had consultation with a psychological\n",
      "support.  I was assisted with some tablets so that I would not\n",
      "have insomnia, and I take two types of tablets on a daily basis.\n",
      "But when I come to the Court and speak in this current condition,\n",
      "I can't not even eat my lunch today because I was overwhelmed and\n",
      "I did not feel like eating anything.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  Now, on the matter of interrogation, you stated to\n",
      "the Chamber that there were five interrogators: Hor, Chan, Tith,\n",
      "Peng and Kuy, but you haven't clearly verified that for each\n",
      "interrogation, were the five present and beating you up or were\n",
      "you interrogated and tortured by only one interrogator at a time?\n",
      "A.   They were there during the interrogation, but only one\n",
      "person beat me at a time and then they took turns.  First Chan\n",
      "beat me up.  He asked me to count the number of lashes.  When I\n",
      "counted up to 10 I told him, and he said, \"It's not yet 10, I\n",
      "only hit you once\".  And I can remember his word.  I remember his\n",
      "words, I remember his face.\n",
      "I can always remember his face, the person who mistreated me.  I\n",
      "remember both, those who did good thing and who did bad things to\n",
      "me.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  The question is, on one day during the\n",
      "interrogation, were the five interrogators beat you up on that\n",
      "same day or only they came on another day?\n",
      "A. That group of interrogators, the five of them, they took turns\n",
      "to beat me up until all the five became exhausted or when the\n",
      "time was up.  For example, from 7 a.m. until about 11 or 12, then\n",
      "they rested.  I saw all of them.\n",
      "Q. So from what I can understand, you confirmed that in -- for\n",
      "each date, the five of them present at the same time.  Is that\n",
      "true?\n",
      "A. That is correct.\n",
      "Q. My next question.  You stated to the Chamber that when they\n",
      "water-hosed you in the common room, so all the inmates had to\n",
      "take off their clothes, and later on they had to dry the floor\n",
      "with their shorts.\n",
      "The question is, did the guards order the prisoners to take off\n",
      "their shorts or the prisoners took off their shorts by\n",
      "themselves?\n",
      "A. I am not sure on this point.  My memory is not clear.  I can\n",
      "remember that all of us, 30 or 40 of us, were all naked, and I\n",
      "even remember one phrase.  The person was about 15 or 16 years\n",
      "old.  He said, \"You, you have a small build but with big\n",
      "genital\".  That's what he said.  \"And this guy, you're big, but\n",
      "your penis is tiny\".  That's what he said.  So they just make a\n",
      "joke out of us being naked.  And I still can remember what was\n",
      "said, but I can not say for sure whether we took off the pants by\n",
      "ourselves or they ordered us to take the pants off.  I'm not sure\n",
      "because probably they ordered us to take the pants off so they\n",
      "can joke about our genitals.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "So for every time you were water-hosed, were all of you had to be\n",
      "naked?\n",
      "A. Yes, we all had to be naked.  I looked around.  Nobody had\n",
      "underwear or pants on them.  People were like animals from hell,\n",
      "all naked.  Because they treated us as enemies, as traitors, they\n",
      "water-hosed us from outside so the water was everywhere in the\n",
      "common room.  So then we tried to dry the floor with our pants\n",
      "until the floor was completely dry.  Then we could lie down on\n",
      "the floor again.\n",

      "I washed my pigs, then I water-hosed my pigs and I used my hands\n",

      "Q. You already stated to the Chamber that you saw female guards\n",
      "walking pregnant prisoners.  And the question is, where did you\n",
      "see the pregnant prisoners being walked; from which direction to\n",
      "which direction?\n",
      "A. Mr. Lawyer, when I looked to the east direction, the canvas\n",
      "was propped against the window and through the door, I could see\n",
      "a pregnant woman being walked and kicked and I did not look for\n",
      "long.  I did not know whether that pregnant woman fell on the\n",
      "ground and got up or walked again because I only had a quick look\n",
      "in that direction and that was what I saw.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "So how many pregnant woman did you see and how many female guards\n",
      "did you see?\n",
      "A. There was only one pregnant woman and there were two or three\n",

      "walking behind.\n",
      "That's all.\n",
      "Q. Can you confirm whether she was kicked from behind or she was\n",

      "A. They were female guards so they kicked her from behind because\n",
      "that female -- that pregnant woman did not walk quickly enough.\n",

      "civil party lawyers.  Thank you.\n",
      "From the time you arrived at S-\n",
      "21, you were tortured in order to            2   extract your confession.  How long were you tortured?\n",
      "A. Miss Lawyer, I am really not clear on the total period of\n",
      "being interrogated; however, it was several months or several\n",
      "weeks, I think.  But being detained there from when I was healthy\n",
      "until I was so skinny; it was quite a long time.\n",
      "It was common when we still had full strengths, but once we\n",
      "became weak they would start to peel our skin.  That expression\n",
      "means they would start to interrogate and torture us.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "My second question; on the 7 January 1979, at that time, you left\n",
      "S-21 office and there were security guards from S-21 office who\n",
      "forced you to go along with them.  Do you or can you recall the\n",
      "names of those guards and how many of them?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, I cannot recall the number of the guards; however,\n",
      "I clearly remember that I was walked from Tuol Sleng toward the\n",
      "Chamkar Duong area.\n",
      "However, when we left Tuol Sleng, we stayed in a house until it\n",
      "was dusk, then we continued our journey toward the direction of\n",
      "Chamkar Duong.  I still cannot recall the number of the guards.\n",
      "I was so fearful at the time I didn't know where they took me.\n",

      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "And what about the names of the guards; do you know their names?\n",
      "A. I only remember the names of the interrogators.  I could not\n",
      "recall the names of the guards.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "My last question:  at that time, you heard the sound of the\n",
      "trucks coming in and going out, taking the prisoners in and out,\n",
      "day and night.  When you heard the sound of the vehicles, was it\n",
      "from the east or from the west entrance?  Please can you try to\n",
      "recall?  It's okay if you cannot remember.\n",
      "A. From my recollection, although I must admit I am forgetful, it\n",
      "was common for the vehicle coming in and going out.  However I\n",
      "did not know when the car going out -- I'm not sure where it went\n",
      "to, I only heard the sound.  And at that time I was a prisoner\n",
      "being detained in the individual cell, and the car sound coming\n",
      "from the front of the Tuol Sleng prison.\n",
      "Q. Now, previously I thought that this is my last question, but\n",
      "now I have another question based on the request from my\n",
      "colleague.\n",
      "You said you heard the screaming of the victims -- that is the\n",
      "screaming of the prisoners at S-21.  When you heard such\n",
      "screaming, was the accused, the prison chief, was there with you?\n",
      "A. While I was sleeping in Building C on the third floor in the\n",
      "common room, at night I heard the screaming.  I think probably\n",
      "the screaming was a result of the person being interrogated and\n",
      "tortured.\n",
      "To me it seems the screaming was echoing and coming from\n",
      "everywhere at the surrounding vicinity of Tuol Sleng prison,\n",
      "probably because during that time those houses around Tuol Sleng\n",
      "were used as the interrogation houses.\n",
      "But now all those houses are gone, even the house where I was\n",
      "interrogated behind Building A outside the compound also\n",

      "MS. JACQUIN:\n",
      "Good afternoon, Your Honours.\n",
      "BY MS. JACQUIN:\n",
      "Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Bou Meng.  These are my questions to you.\n",
      "First of all, you stated that in the common room there were\n",
      "foreign prisoners or people who looked foreign, westerners.  Were\n",
      "they taken away while you were still in that room or were they\n",
      "still in that room at the time when you were taken away from that\n",
      "room?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, when I saw them they were westerners or we say\n",
      "Europeans.  They had light complexion and blond hair.  Of course\n",
      "I did not know their nationality.  I saw them for only a short\n",
      "period of time and then they disappeared.  They were there for\n",
      "probably two weeks being detained on that floor of Building C.\n",
      "So after about two weeks they disappeared and I didn't know where\n",
      "they were taken to.  That's all.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "You stated that you saw Vietnamese soldiers in uniform;\n",
      "consequently, you were quite sure that they were indeed\n",
      "Vietnamese soldiers, beyond doubt.\n",
      "A. Let me tell you, Ms. Lawyer, those Vietnamese soldiers,\n",
      "because they wore a different uniform, military uniform,\n",
      "different from the Khmer Rouge military uniforms, that uniform\n",
      "was similar to the Chinese soldier uniform.  They had a khaki\n",
      "colour and they had their rank displayed and they wore the type\n",
      "of helmet.  That's what led to my conclusion.  That's all.\n",
      "Q. I'm asking this question because there seems to be something\n",
      "ambiguous in your response unless I have misunderstood.\n",
      "Would these Vietnamese soldiers have been soldiers who retained\n",
      "their uniforms, or were these Vietnamese soldiers partners of the\n",
      "Khmer Rouge as guards and organizers of the prison?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, it is my personal view that they were real\n",
      "soldiers, they were not fake.  So it was the real military\n",
      "uniform, although some uniforms were rather old.  That is all.\n",
      "Q. So you confirm that those soldiers did not have a status of\n",
      "prisoners?\n",
      "A. I was wondering, for example, like when Kaing Guek Eav, alias\n",
      "Duch, said when you were sent there you would be treated as the\n",
      "enemy regardless you were civilians or soldiers, you were all\n",
      "regarded as the enemy.\n",
      "Q. Furthermore, you have stated that you saw a number of guards\n",
      "who were 15 or 16 years old.  They were mere teenagers.  Have you\n",
      "seen guards who were younger than that still, who would have\n",
      "been, let's say, 10 or 12 years old?\n",
      "A. I did not see any guards who were 15 or under, unless I was\n",
      "mistaken.  Usually they were 15 or above.  That was through my\n",
      "observation at the time.  That's all.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  And I have two personal questions for you now.\n",
      "Do you feel bad about having signed the confession that you had\n",
      "to sign because of duress, whereas you knew that this confession,\n",
      "the content of it, was false?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, at that time my emotion was mixed.  I was fearful,\n",
      "worried; I could not describe the emotion.  So I just did what I\n",
      "was ordered to do because there was absolutely no reason for them\n",
      "to suspect me to be a CIA or KGB agent, and I was tortured\n",
      "enough.\n",
      "Some prisoners, when they were tortured and interrogated, they\n",
      "confessed and finally they were taken and smashed, but for me I\n",
      "was different.  Of course physically I signed the confession but\n",
      "inside my heart I of course did not approve the confession.\n",
      "Q. I'm sure nobody would challenge that, sir.\n",
      "Another question.  Within the workshop amongst the sculptors,\n",
      "painters, artists would you amongst yourselves talk at all about\n",
      "the tortures that you had been subjected to and the confessions\n",
      "that you were forced to sign?  Did you talk about these things\n",
      "amongst yourselves within the workshop?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, I never talked about that.  The reason is because\n",
      "I was scared.  Usually there were two or three prison guards who\n",
      "were there constantly and the door was locked both inside and\n",
      "outside, so if we whispered or chit-chatted on this thing then\n",
      "it's so risky.\n",
      "Q. One last question.  Today how do you feel about the fact that\n",
      "you are a survivor?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, I am so delighted that now my chest seems to be\n",
      "lighter.  All my statements to the Judges and to the lawyers and\n",
      "the rest, I felt much better now and I believed through peace and\n",
      "justice would be done for those 1.8 or two million people who\n",
      "lost their lives during that regime, and I myself too, I was a\n",
      "victim and the scope of suffering was incalculable.  I was almost\n",
      "killed.  My back was wounded severely and still I could carry out\n",
      "my profession, painting the portraits to satisfy the chief of the\n",
      "prison.\n",
      "But it was shameful that I could not save the life of my wife.\n",
      "I'm not sure if it was my mistake or not and I really want to ask\n",
      "the accused where was my wife killed.  If I know where it is then\n",
      "I would go there in order to pray for her soul, and that I am now\n",
      "being testified before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Court of\n",
      "Cambodia, only the spirit of the earth would know where the soul\n",
      "has gone to or where the dead bodies were buried.  So only the\n",
      "spirits of the wind, of the water, of the earth would know.\n",
      "And for those who killed the people, they could tell the truth or\n",
      "they could lie, but only the spirits of the earth, the wind and\n",
      "the water know where my wife died, so that I could pray for her\n",
      "soul.  That is all.\n",
      "MS. JACQUIN:\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. Bou Meng.\n",
      "Mr. President, on behalf of all the civil party groups, we have a\n",
      "request to put to you.  We would like to ask for 10 extra\n",
      "minutes.  There are seven lawyers present here representing 90\n",
      "victims.  All of these victims are important.  If we are to share\n",
      "out this time it would amount to one half-minute per victim, but\n",
      "we have legitimate questions to put.\n",
      "Sir, you have been showing tolerance in interpreting the time\n",
      "allowance and we are grateful for this.  However, we have all\n",
      "sorts of time management problems.  If you could assure us that\n",
      "we have could have, if need be, an extra 10 minutes, this would\n",
      "make it possible for us to work amongst ourselves more\n",
      "harmoniously.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "MS. CANIZARES:\n",
      "Mr. President, if extra time were to be granted to the\n",
      "representatives of the civil parties would it be possible to have\n",
      "extra time, if necessary, for the defence to ask questions?\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "In order not to complicate the matter regarding the request by\n",
      "both sides and the civil party lawyers use the time as allocated\n",
      "by the Chamber, however, the Chamber will not allow extra time\n",
      "and the time has run out already.\n",
      "Now I would give the opportunity to the survivor, Bou Meng.\n",
      "Uncle Bou Meng, do you have any questions that you would like to\n",
      "ask the accused at the moment?\n",
      "MR. BOU MENG:\n",
      "Mr. President, I would like to ask him where did he smash my\n",
      "wife; whether it was at Tuol Sleng or Choeung Ek or at another\n",
      "location.\n",
      "Did you have the authority to relocate her or to smash her?  It\n",
      "has been so many years already.  I went to her native village in\n",
      "Tboung Khmum district in Kampong Cham province.   I went to ask\n",
      "her elder sibling whether my wife has ever returned to the\n",
      "village and the response was no.  So I presumed that she was\n",
      "killed while she was detained.\n",
      "And my question is just to tell me, just to tell me where she was\n",
      "killed or smashed.  Then I would go to that location and just to\n",
      "get the soil from that location to pray for her soul because\n",
      "there was not her document at the S-21 Office.  I used to have\n",
      "some documents as well, but some of the documents I have I have\n",
      "lost or are missing.  And I want the matter to be done legally.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Can you verify that your wife, who was detained at S-21 with you,\n",
      "her name was Ma Yoeun alias Thy.  Is that correct?\n",
      "MR. BOU MENG:\n",
      "That is correct, Mr. President.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Mr. Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, the first question is, do you\n",
      "know Ma Yoeun alias Thy?  If you know her, could you answer to\n",
      "his question that when you were the chairman of S-21 and that his\n",
      "wife was taken away to be executed, where was she killed?  In\n",
      "Phnom Penh or at Choeung Ek?\n",
      "THE ACCUSED:\n",
      "Mr. President, thank you, Mr. President for giving me the\n",
      "opportunity to respond to the question.\n",
      "Mr. Meng, especially for you I have been moved.  We have lived\n",
      "together and you were healthy and I was shocked to see you on the\n",
      "28th of February 2008 before the Co-Investigating Judges.  I\n",
      "would like to respond to your desire, but it was beyond my\n",
      "capacity because this work done by my subordinates, but I would\n",
      "like to presume that your wife might have been killed at Boeng\n",
      "Choeung Ek.\n",
      "Meanwhile, to be sure, I would like to ask you to please ask\n",
      "Comrade Huy who may be able to tell you further detail about the\n",
      "fate of your wife.  Please accept my highest assurance of my\n",
      "regards and respects towards the soul of your wife.  That's all.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "The accused, please control your emotion and re-compose because\n",
      "the moment is important that it takes time to listen to the\n",
      "testimony of the survivors who have survived the regime and to\n",
      "recall the past.\n",
      "So, Uncle Bou Meng, I hope you have already been told by the\n",
      "accused about the fate of your wife because his conclusion is\n",
      "that she could have been killed at Boeng Choeung Ek, especially\n",
      "when it comes to the time when she was sent in during the year of\n",
      "1977. \n",
      "          19   At the beginning, the killing would take place only at the\n",
      "premises of Tuol Sleng compound and later on, after 1977 to '78,\n",
      "then the execution sites had been shifted to Choeung Ek.  So it\n",
      "could be possible that the fate of your wife would be ended there\n",
      "at Choeung Ek or she would be killed there.\n",
      "And to get further information, it is rather difficult because\n",
      "the people who perished amounted to more than 12,000, and those\n",
      "more than 1\n",
      "2,000 were registered and there were still numbers of            2   detainees who are still unaccounted for.  At the beginning, we\n",
      "know that there would have been 12,300 or something detainees,\n",
      "but after inspecting the list and compared with other lists, then\n",
      "we could see more numbers, different numbers of the people killed\n",
      "during that time.  But I think the actual number of people who\n",
      "would have been killed would be even higher if all documents\n",
      "could be supported.\n",
      "Next, the accused, besides your response to Uncle Bou Meng, one\n",
      "of the survivors who asked you about the fate of his wife, the\n",
      "Chamber would like to also know whether the accused would like to\n",
      "make any comments or observations, testimony, concerning the\n",

      "opportunity to do so if you would wish.\n",
      "THE ACCUSED:\n",
      "Mr. President, first, I would like to confirm to Mr. Bou Meng and\n",
      "the other victims.  He keep asking what kind of mistakes he had\n",
      "committed; what kind of mistake his wife committed that led to\n",
      "their arrest.\n",
      "Frankly, during that time, I already -- I think yesterday I told\n",
      "Brother Mey already -- anyone who opposed them would be singled\n",
      "out as the CIA, the KGB, or the expansionist, so on and so forth.\n",
      "So I would like just to repeat it and to be more precise.\n",
      "I would like to state that the Cultural Revolution of China would\n",
      "be seen as the reference.  Although Pol Pot did not follow\n",
      "exactly that kind of philosophy, he used his own improvised\n",
      "theory, so he would implicate anyone as an enemy.\n",
      "And I told Brother Mey already about the CIA.  He asked me\n",
      "whether CIA or KGB agents have already been smashed and I told\n",
      "him that anyone who opposes the Pol Pot were those who have\n",
      "defeated the Pol Pot regime.\n",
      "And, after all, the fascist political politics ended on January\n",
      "1979, so the reason why people were implicated or opponents, this\n",

      "A. I said it was very quiet because the doors were all shut when\n",

      "was not brave enough to even look back to see how many people\n",

      "And I think regarding the screams, the cries, I knew that my ears\n",
      "were too good to listen to those noises because I was also a very\n",
      "good artist.  Having heard the sound, I could even draft or\n",
      "sketch a kind of portrait, so I think I was not mistaken to hear\n",
      "those screams during the time when I was detained.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  Could you please emphasize again: you said that\n",
      "before the morning break, you said that the building was full of\n",
      "people.  And you said that the building was full of detainees but\n",

      "anyone scream or cry because we would be punished.  But I'm\n",
      "talking about the people who would be taken away to be\n",

      "houses.  I'm not here to talk and to implicate anyone.  I'm\n",

      "Q. Thank you.  I would like you to only confirm.  Number two, I\n",
      "would like your confirmation also.  You said the subordinates of\n",

      "We would like you to please recompose yourself.\n",

      "his subordinates to beat the Vietnamese detainee?  And some said\n",
      "that he was the Khmer Krom national who pretended to be a good\n",
      "sculptor.  So the question is whether Duch did order such torture\n",
      "or punishment to be inflicted on that person, or Duch\n",
      "subordinates initiated such ideas of punishment spontaneously,\n",
      "because there was a torture inflicted on that person; so whether\n",
      "it was ordered or not ordered by Duch.  Could you please verify?\n",
      "A. I did not see or hear it.  That's why I cannot presume that he\n",
      "ordered his subordinates to do that.  Or maybe his subordinates\n",
      "just did that by themselves.  I can say that without any order\n",
      "from their subordinates I don't even think that their\n",

      "you know, like, when they treated their staff, they would cover\n",
      "the blankets all over their body and walk them away because they\n",
      "were afraid to let us know.  I don't know, but I think it is just\n",

      "your testimony concerning the accused because a witness is not\n",
