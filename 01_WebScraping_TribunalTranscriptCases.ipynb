      "18   themselves, but when you were thirsty how could you do it,\n",
      "19   because there were no water jars left with water for detainees,\n",

      "21   then if you were shackled before that, you could not sit up\n",

      "6   After having that long metal bar attached to my legs and my\n",

      "8   face down in order for the interrogator to be able to beat me on\n",
      "9   my back and I could put my face down.\n",

      "3   back to the room.  After they beat me up, they did not take me to\n",
      "4   the common room.  They took me to the individual cell.  So every\n",
      "5   time after the interrogation and the torture, I was taken to the\n",
      "6   ground floor -- to the individual cell.  And for the mealtime,\n",
      "7   then we were fed with a bowl of food.\n",
      "8   Q. So in summary, you were detained in two different rooms.\n",
      "9   First, you were in the common room and about five months later,\n",
      "10   when they started to interrogate and torture you by using the\n",

      "12   correct?\n",
      "13   A. Mr. President, that is correct.\n",

      "18   me to Building D and there was a power outlet on the wall and\n",
      "19   then they used an electrical wire to electrocute me.  I felt\n",
      "20   unconscious and later on they used the water to pour on my face\n",
      "21   and I became unconscious again.  I did not know the voltage of\n",

      "6   anybody.  We were just detained.  And one day after they\n",
      "7   exhausted by beating me up, then they walked me back into the\n",

      "6   chosen?\n",
      "7   A. Mr. President, towards the later '77, because in early 1978 I\n",
      "8   already painted a canvas.  One day I heard the noise from the\n",
      "9   loudspeaker, I think they celebrated something at the Olympic\n",
      "10   Stadium, and we were given a lot of food.  We ate to our fill and\n",
      "11   the guards gave us the food.  And I even have the noodles,\n",
      "12   Chinese noodles to eat.\n",
      "13   And Nath said I had to jump, to jump up so that the food will go\n",
      "14   down lower through my stomach and I can eat more to fill to my\n",
      "15   stomach.  And I told him, \"Once you are full, you are full.  You\n",
      "16   only have one stomach to fill in.\"\n",
      "17   I think I started painting the portrait in late '77 or early '78\n",
      "18   because there were four portraits and each portrait, when Duch\n",
      "19   asked me, \"How long did it take to make that portrait?  And the\n",
      "20   portrait must look the same as the photo,\" and I told him -- I\n",
      "21   requested to have three months to make that portrait because the\n",
      "22   canvas was huge.  It was 1.5 metres wide and three metres high.\n",
      "23   I would like to seek your permission to show the portrait of Pol\n",

      "2   This is my response, Your Honour.\n",
      "3   Q. During the time that you were released to work by doing the\n",
      "4   painting, where did you paint and who else worked with you in\n",
      "5   that location?\n",
      "6   A. Mr. President, yes, I myself, Bou Meng; Vann Nath too; Im\n",
      "7   Chan, the wood sculptor and the wax moulder, another wax moulder;\n",
      "8   so that's all.  And we worked in Building E.  Building E is the\n",

      "10   the reception area for the guests who come to visit the museum.\n",
      "11   Q. What about the food ration after you were chosen to work as a\n",
      "12   painter?  Was the food ration the same as those given to the\n",
      "13   prisoners?\n",
      "14   A. Mr. President, the food ration was better than previously, so\n",
      "15   it was from the thin gruel to rice and we had sufficient soup.\n",
      "16   So the prison guard carried the soup to deliver it to us and we\n",
      "17   shared among ourselves.\n",
      "18\n",
      "19   Q. During the time you were selected to work as a painter, where\n",
      "20   were you allowed to sleep at night?\n",
      "21   A. After I painted and when it was time to sleep, it was at the\n",
      "22   generator's room.  It was behind Building E.  At that time there\n",
      "23   was a generator there, so when the electricity was cut off, then\n",
      "24   they started the generator and we slept in that generator's room.\n",
      "25   Q. Were you cuffed or shackled in that room or were you locked \n",
      " \n",
      "E1/41.1\n",
      "1   from outside?\n",
      "2   A. I was allowed to sleep in that room but I was not cuffed or\n",
      "3   shackled, so there was seven of us -- Oeng Bech, Vann Nath, Im\n",
      "4   Chan, Pha Tha Chan, Ruy Makong.  There were seven of us -- and\n",
      "5   Chum Mey.  I requested to see the photo: Pha Tha Chan, Bou Meng,\n",

      "11   MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "12   I don't think it is yet your time.  It is now my question and I\n",
      "13   have the discretion.\n",
      "14\n",
      "15   BY MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "16   Q. During the times you were asked to do the painting, did you\n",
      "17   meet the accused, Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch?\n",
      "18   A. Mr. President, Your Honours, at that time Mr. Kaing Guek Eav,\n",
      "19   alias Duch, sat next to me watching me painting the portrait of\n",
      "20   Brother Number One, Pol Pot, and he ordered me, \"You should\n",
      "21   adjust the throat.  It's not a tumour, it's just fat.\"  So as can\n",
      "22   be seen from this photo which was taken of the portraits that I\n",
      "23   painted, so you could see that the throat was slimmer.\n",
      "24   Q. Did he come to visit you often to see you painting?  And if he\n",
      "25   came, during the day or nighttime? \n",
      " \n",
      "E1/41.1\n",
      "1   A. He came often during the daytime and he wore shorts and a\n",
      "2   short-sleeved shirt.  So he came in, he sat with his one leg\n",
      "3   across and watching me drawing, for example, another portrait of\n",
      "4   the head of Ho Chi Minh on the body of a dog.  It was like a\n",
      "5   cartoon which they -- it was like a sketch of the sea with a\n",
      "6   flat, windy situation, et cetera and et cetera.\n",
      "7   Q. Did you notice his character and behaviour during the time\n",
      "8   that he watched you making the painting or the portrait?\n",
      "9   A. Mr. President, he did not really beat me up, however, one day\n",
      "10   I didn't know what I did wrong.  He asked me and Im Chan to beat\n",
      "11   each other up.  So we were given a piece of black plastic tube to\n",
      "12   hit, to beat each other, and he sat there watching us beating\n",
      "13   each other up.  After a while he ordered us to stop.\n",
      "14\n",
      "15   But if I could make a very lifelike portrait, he would look at it\n",
      "16   carefully and I think I lost some of the portraits.\n",
      "17   Q. The question is, did you observe his facial expression or his\n",
      "18   behaviour; that is the behaviour of the accused, Kaing Guek Eav,\n",
      "19   alias Duch, during the time that he went to watch you painting?\n",
      "20   Was he a person full of joy or full of sorrow?  Did you notice\n",
      "21   that?\n",
      "22   A. Mr. President, his facial expression was normal.  If he needed\n",
      "23   to laugh, he laughed.  Sometimes he smiled.  I could see him\n",
      "24   through his face but I could not judge his feeling or emotion,\n",
      "25   and that's the word I was asked especially by a journalist, and I \n",
      " \n",
      "E1/41.1\n",
      "1   always tell them, \"I know his face but I don't know his feeling\".\n",
      "2   He was close to me, observing me painting.  Sometimes he gave me\n",
      "3   cigarettes to smoke.\n",
      "4   Q. Did he ever beat you up personally?\n",
      "5   A. No, but he ordered me to beat up with Im Chan.  I was not\n",
      "6   happy with that.  He did not treat me like a human being.\n",
      "7   Q. Did you ever see him going from one building to the next\n",
      "8   within the compound of the prison; for example, from Building A\n",
      "9   to B to C, or did he only enter the compound and only come to the\n",
      "10   place where you worked?\n",
      "11   A. Mr. President, I did not see him walking along each building\n",
      "12   because when he entered his main focus was on the portrait of\n",
      "13   Brother Number One, Pol Pot.  I only saw him coming to my\n",
      "14   workshop.  I did not see him going anywhere else.\n",
      "15   Q. So besides him, besides you yourself, did you see him\n",
      "16   torturing or beating up other prisoners?\n",
      "17   A. Mr. President, let me go back a little bit.\n",
      "18   One day there was a Vietnamese citizen.  He boasted that he could\n",
      "19   make a wax mould and then he was ordered to show his skill.  So\n",
      "20   he was tested and Duch saw that he could not do it.  Then he\n",
      "21   ordered the interrogators to kick him like kick a ball because,\n",
      "22   from what I understood, he was angry that that person lied to\n",
      "23   him.  And I did not know what happened to that Vietnamese person.\n",
      "24   Probably he was taken out.\n",
      "25    \n",
      " \n",
      "E1/41.1\n",
      "1   Q. Did he himself order the guards or his subordinates to torture\n",
      "2   that person?  And if he did order, can you recall his exact\n",
      "3   words; that is, the words that Duch used to order his\n",
      "4   subordinates to torture that Vietnamese person?\n",
      "5   A. Mr. President, I forget some parts.  I am not sure.  I think\n",
      "6   probably he signalled his guards to beat that Vietnamese person.\n",
      "7   And the Vietnamese person was taken away from the workshop where\n",
      "8   I worked.  So there were woodcrafters; there was a painter and\n",
      "9   another artist.  We worked in the same workshop.\n",
      "10   Q. You saw the guards beating up that person who boasted about\n",
      "11   his skill.  Was the beating taking place within the workshop\n",
      "12   vicinity in Building E or was he taken out and beaten up outsides\n",
      "13   that area?\n",
      "14   A. Mr. President, at that time the three or four of them kicked\n",
      "15   that Vietnamese person and beat him up and walked him away.  I\n",
      "16   did not hear his order.  So when those guards beat the Vietnamese\n",
      "17   person up, Duch had already left.\n",
      "18   Q. So during the time you were asked to work as a painter, how\n",
      "19   many portraits did you paint and whose portraits were they?\n",
      "20   A. There were four portraits of Pol Pot.  However, there was\n",
      "21   another portrait in 1981.  There was a German group to make a\n",
      "22   film on that portrait, so I showed the portrait to the person and\n",
      "23   then I used paint to make a cross sign on that person to express\n",
      "24   my hatred of that person, and that was filmed by the German\n",
      "25   group. \n",
      " \n",
      "E1/41.1\n",
      "1\n",
      "2   Q. You said that you painted various other paintings or\n",
      "3   portraits; for example, a painting of a dog with the Ho Hi Minh\n",
      "4   head on it.  But for Pol Pot portraits you only made four\n",
      "5   portraits?\n",
      "6   A. That is correct, Mr. President.\n",
      "7   Q. So besides the portraits of Brother Number One, Pol Pot, did\n",
      "8   you make any other painting or portrait?\n",
      "9   A. Mr., President, yes, I painted Hua Guofeng, Mao Zhedong in\n",
      "10   large canvas as well, so the canvas was as big as the canvas for\n",
      "11   Pol Pot's portrait.\n",
      "12   Q. When you did your painting or portrait, did you do it\n",
      "13   individually or together with Vann Nath?  That is, Vann Nath was\n",
      "14   painting his own painting or portrait and you yourself had a\n",
      "15   separate painting or portrait?\n",
      "16   A. Mr. President, at that time he did not have a skill of\n",
      "17   painting black and white portraits so I mixed the black and white\n",
      "18   painting by myself with one litre of gasoline to burn it and the\n",
      "19   smoke would go into that painting and then I mixed it.  And Vann\n",
      "20   Nath did not have this skill.\n",
      "21   Q. So it means that your painting was separate from him because\n",
      "22   one was colour and one was black and white.  Is that correct?\n",
      "23   A. Yes, that is correct.\n",
      "24\n",
      "25   Q. You talked about the portrait of Pol Pot.  This is one of the \n",
      " \n",
      "E1/41.1\n",
      "1   portraits of other people that you painted.  Is that correct?\n",
      "2   A. Yes, Mr. President, that is correct.\n",
      "3   MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "4   Court officer, can you take a photo of the portrait of Pol Pot to\n",
      "5   be projected on the monitor, on the slide?\n",
      "6   BY MR. PRESIDENT:\n",

      "9   were asked to make a drawing or portrait of the leader of the\n",
      "10   Democratic Kampuchea?\n",
      "11   A. Yes, Mr. President, this is the portrait.\n",
      "12   Q. You stated just then that because of your skill of making the\n",
      "13   portrait that you survived until today.  Can you explain further\n",
      "14   the reason of this portrait that led to the survival?\n",
      "15   A. Mr. President, the reason, from my understanding, is that my\n",
      "16   painting is a resemblance of the photo, so I started painting\n",
      "17   portraits 1, 2, 3 and 4 and another one.  While I was painting,\n",
      "18   then the time came when the Vietnamese and the National United\n",

      "3   Is it true that you were sent there?\n",
      "4   A. I think it is not true because I stayed in Tuol Sleng prison,\n",
      "5   but when we were evacuated it would be true that I was walking\n",
      "6   and reached Prey Sar somewhere near Boeung Choueng Ek for about\n",
      "7   five minutes, and then we later on were ordered to move to Prey\n",

      "7   Q. So was it at night or during the daytime?  I'm asking this\n",
      "8   because after hearing testimony we have received two different\n",

      "13   A. During the time when I was being interrogated some people ate\n",
      "14   the jackfruit and they threw the remaining -- the peel of the\n",
      "15   jackfruit onto my head and I could feel like then I was perceived\n",

      "19   were working in the workshop at S-21.  You were at the workshop\n",

      "15   ration, was it enough?\n",
      "16   A. The food ration, during the time when I was detained, was\n",

      "18   paint and when I came out to work as the painter with Vann Nath,\n",
      "19   with Kong, with Pha Tha Chan and Bech, the food was adequate.\n",
      "20   But it was inadequate when I was still in the prison.\n",

      "24   When you were being detained at S-21 in the common room and in\n",

      "E1/41.1\n",
      "1   inadequate.  How could you fulfil your hunger?\n",
      "2   A. There was no substitute.  I was so hungry.  When I saw the\n",
      "3   lizard crawling on the ceiling I would wish that it dropped down\n",
      "4   so that I could grab it and eat to fulfil my hunger.  I told\n",
      "5   myself that I did not know what kind of bad deeds I committed\n",
      "6   previously that I would be treated like this without enough food,\n",
      "7   without enough water, and I was questioning myself and I was\n",

      "3    A. Miss Lawyer, I am really not clear on the total period of\n",
      "4   being interrogated; however, it was several months or several\n",
      "5   weeks, I think.  But being detained there from when I was healthy\n",

      "12   S-21 office and there were security guards from S-21 office who\n",
      "13   forced you to go along with them.  Do you or can you recall the\n",

      "18   Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Bou Meng.  These are my questions to you.\n",
      "19   First of all, you stated that in the common room there were\n",

      "21   they taken away while you were still in that room or were they\n",

      "23   room?\n",
      "24   A. Ms. Lawyer, when I saw them they were westerners or we say\n",
      "25   Europeans.  They had light complexion and blond hair.  Of course \n",
      " \n",
      "E1/41.1\n",
      "1   I did not know their nationality.  I saw them for only a short\n",
      "2   period of time and then they disappeared.  They were there for\n",
      "3   probably two weeks being detained on that floor of Building C.\n",
      "4   So after about two weeks they disappeared and I didn't know where\n",
      "5   they were taken to.  That's all.\n",
      "6\n",
      "7   Q. Thank you.\n",
      "8   You stated that you saw Vietnamese soldiers in uniform;\n",
      "9   consequently, you were quite sure that they were indeed\n",
      "10   Vietnamese soldiers, beyond doubt.\n",
      "11   A. Let me tell you, Ms. Lawyer, those Vietnamese soldiers,\n",
      "12   because they wore a different uniform, military uniform,\n",
      "13   different from the Khmer Rouge military uniforms, that uniform\n",
      "14   was similar to the Chinese soldier uniform.  They had a khaki\n",
      "15   colour and they had their rank displayed and they wore the type\n",
      "16   of helmet.  That's what led to my conclusion.  That's all.\n",
      "17   Q. I'm asking this question because there seems to be something\n",
      "18   ambiguous in your response unless I have misunderstood.\n",
      "19   Would these Vietnamese soldiers have been soldiers who retained\n",
      "20   their uniforms, or were these Vietnamese soldiers partners of the\n",
      "21   Khmer Rouge as guards and organizers of the prison?\n",
      "22   A. Ms. Lawyer, it is my personal view that they were real\n",
      "23   soldiers, they were not fake.  So it was the real military\n",
      "24   uniform, although some uniforms were rather old.  That is all.\n",
      "25    \n",
      " \n",
      "E1/41.1\n",
      "1   Q. So you confirm that those soldiers did not have a status of\n",
      "2   prisoners?\n",
      "3   A. I was wondering, for example, like when Kaing Guek Eav, alias\n",
      "4   Duch, said when you were sent there you would be treated as the\n",
      "5   enemy regardless you were civilians or soldiers, you were all\n",
      "6   regarded as the enemy.\n",
      "7   Q. Furthermore, you have stated that you saw a number of guards\n",
      "8   who were 15 or 16 years old.  They were mere teenagers.  Have you\n",
      "9   seen guards who were younger than that still, who would have\n",
      "10   been, let's say, 10 or 12 years old?\n",
      "11   A. I did not see any guards who were 15 or under, unless I was\n",
      "12   mistaken.  Usually they were 15 or above.  That was through my\n",
      "13   observation at the time.  That's all.\n",
      "14   Q. Thank you.  And I have two personal questions for you now.\n",
      "15   Do you feel bad about having signed the confession that you had\n",
      "16   to sign because of duress, whereas you knew that this confession,\n",
      "17   the content of it, was false?\n",
      "18   A. Ms. Lawyer, at that time my emotion was mixed.  I was fearful,\n",
      "19   worried; I could not describe the emotion.  So I just did what I\n",
      "20   was ordered to do because there was absolutely no reason for them\n",
      "21   to suspect me to be a CIA or KGB agent, and I was tortured\n",
      "22   enough.\n",
      "23\n",
      "24   Some prisoners, when they were tortured and interrogated, they\n",
      "25   confessed and finally they were taken and smashed, but for me I \n",
      " \n",
      "E1/41.1\n",
      "1   was different.  Of course physically I signed the confession but\n",
      "2   inside my heart I of course did not approve the confession.\n",
      "3   Q. I'm sure nobody would challenge that, sir.\n",
      "4   Another question.  Within the workshop amongst the sculptors,\n",
      "5   painters, artists would you amongst yourselves talk at all about\n",
      "6   the tortures that you had been subjected to and the confessions\n",
      "7   that you were forced to sign?  Did you talk about these things\n",
      "8   amongst yourselves within the workshop?\n",
      "9   A. Ms. Lawyer, I never talked about that.  The reason is because\n",
      "10   I was scared.  Usually there were two or three prison guards who\n",
      "11   were there constantly and the door was locked both inside and\n",
      "12   outside, so if we whispered or chit-chatted on this thing then\n",
      "13   it's so risky.\n",
      "14   Q. One last question.  Today how do you feel about the fact that\n",
      "15   you are a survivor?\n",
      "16   A. Ms. Lawyer, I am so delighted that now my chest seems to be\n",
      "17   lighter.  All my statements to the Judges and to the lawyers and\n",
      "18   the rest, I felt much better now and I believed through peace and\n",
      "19   justice would be done for those 1.8 or two million people who\n",
      "20   lost their lives during that regime, and I myself too, I was a\n",
      "21   victim and the scope of suffering was incalculable.  I was almost\n",
      "22   killed.  My back was wounded severely and still I could carry out\n",
      "23   my profession, painting the portraits to satisfy the chief of the\n",

      "3   the accused where was my wife killed.  If I know where it is then\n",

      "18   victims.  All of these victims are important.  If we are to share\n",

      "21   Sir, you have been showing tolerance in interpreting the time\n",
      "22   allowance and we are grateful for this.  However, we have all\n",

      "20   Did you have the authority to relocate her or to smash her?  It\n",
      "21   has been so many years already.  I went to her native village in\n",

      "23   her elder sibling whether my wife has ever returned to the\n",

      "15   accused about the fate of your wife because his conclusion is\n",
      "16   that she could have been killed at Boeng Choeung Ek, especially\n",
      "17   when it comes to the time when she was sent in during the year of\n",
