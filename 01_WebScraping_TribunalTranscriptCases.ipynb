      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   And do you also remember giving another statement in April of\n",
      "2008 in which you made some corrections to your 1998 statement?  Do you\n",
      "remember that?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  Maybe I didn't go through every single detail, but I think\n",
      "I corrected a lot of mistakes that were there in terms of place, names,\n",
      "people's names and that kind of thing.\n",
      "in the last\n",
      "couple of days, have these two statements been read to you in the Bosnian\n",
      "language?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  There was a lady who proofed me for my appearance, and we\n",
      "checked the statement for veracity.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  And we did make a couple of additional changes --\n",
      "A.   Just a minute, please.\n",
      "Q.   It's too loud?\n",
      "A.   A little softer, please.  It's too loud.  The sound is very loud,\n",
      "and I don't like noise.  Thank you.\n",
      "Q.   I'll try to speak a little softer.  Now, we made a couple of more\n",
      "changes to your 1998 statement, and I'm going to ask you about those\n",
      "little changes in a minute, but other than those changes everything else\n",
      "in the statement is still true; is that right?\n",
      "A.   I think so.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  May we bring up -- it doesn't have a 65 ter\n",
      "number.  It's the statement, 1998 statement, ERN 00584654 to 4669.  I\n",
      "would like to go to page 2 in both versions, and it's second paragraph\n",
      "down on the page.\n",
      "Q.   In just a moment, sir, you'll see your statement come up on the\n",
      "screen, and then I'm going to ask you a question.\n",
      "Okay.  Now, sir, on the left side of your screen, do you see part\n",
      "of your statement in the Bosnian language?  On the left side of the\n",
      "screen.  Is that yes?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   And you see that -- in the statement you say the date of your\n",
      "arrest was 9 of June of 1992.  Now, would you like to change that date?\n",
      "A.   Maybe this is a small inaccuracy.  It was sometime in June.  The\n",
      "9th, the 19th.  I tend to get confused about dates.  It might have been\n",
      "the 19th.  Maybe it was recorded as the 9th, but I'm actually quite\n",
      "certain that it was the 19th.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Now, also in this statement when we read down a little bit\n",
      "further, you talk about the badges that were on the Serb police or army\n",
      "persons who took you into custody, and you describe an SDS badge with two\n",
      "eagles and also a three-coloured flag.  Now, would you like to make a\n",
      "correction to that?\n",
      "A.   In the barracks there was an SDS flag.  The sign belonged to the\n",
      "SDS, and then the two eagles and the cross, that was for the whole thing.\n",
      "It was some sort of a formation.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Thank you.  But with particular focus on what these men\n",
      "were wearing, you told me that you -- it was not possible that two badges\n",
      "be together.  Didn't you tell me that?\n",
      "A.   I don't think that could have been the case, not two at the same\n",
      "time.  There were several signs, different signs that were turning up,\n",
      "and there were these radical parties with two eagles and a cross.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  I just want you to focus on the badge.  Can you remember,\n",
      "sitting here today, what -- what badges these men were wearing, and if\n",
      "you can, would you please tell us?\n",
      "A.   The civilians, you mean?\n",
      "Q.   No, no.\n",
      "A.   The civilians weren't wearing anything at all.\n",
      "Q.   No.  Just the two -- the Serb police or army that arrested you in\n",
      "June of 1992.  Do you remember the emblems?  Okay.  Could you tell us,\n",
      "please?\n",
      "A.   The people who arrested me had something blue on them.  The car\n",
      "said \"Police,\" and the insignia belonged to the SDS, if I remember\n",
      "correctly.  They were members of the SDS.  It was a party symbol.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Thank you.  Now, I would like to go to page 7 in the\n",
      "English and page 6 in the B/C/S.  In the B/C/S, it's the last paragraph\n",
      "on the page.  In English, it's the first paragraph.\n",
      "Sir, I'd like you to take a look, again, on the left side of the\n",
      "screen and look at the last paragraph, the first sentence.  It says that\n",
      "you saw Milan Lukic take away more than 20 people.  Is that what it says?\n",
      "A.   I heard his voice, but there were five or six persons involved.\n",
      "I don't think he could have handled this on his own.  As for\n",
      "mistreatment, he was the one who came most frequently.\n",
      "Q.   And I'll ask you about that in a minute, but my question is, with\n",
      "reference to this, you did not actually see Mr. Lukic do this, did you?\n",
      "A.   It was night-time.  It was dark.  I didn't know what time it was.\n",
      "All the people who did that, I couldn't see them, but I heard voices and\n",
      "I recognised the voices --\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Thank you.\n",
      "A.   -- because he came several times and I saw him personally.  I met\n",
      "him then.  I hadn't known him before.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  So I asked you a minute ago, other than these corrections\n",
      "to your statement, everything else is still true; is that -- to the best\n",
      "of your knowledge.  Is that correct?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  The indictees themselves should tell us whether it was like\n",
      "this or not.  I think they should be free to say what they have to say.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  Your Honour, I ask that this witness's 1998 and\n",
      "2008 statement be admitted in evidence.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  We admit it.\n",

      "MS. SARTORIO:\n",
      "Q.   Now, just some more questions, sir.  In 1992 were you a member of\n",
      "any army?\n",
      "A.   No.\n",
      "Q.   And were you ever a member of any army?\n",
      "A.   Never.\n",
      "Q.   In June -- okay.  In June of 1992, did you wear any type of\n",
      "military clothing at all?\n",
      "A.   No, never.  I was a civilian throughout.  Normally, I would wear\n",
      "a jacket such as the one I'm wearing now.\n",
      "Q.   And did you carry a firearm or any other type of weapon in June\n",
      "of 1992?\n",
      "A.   No.  I never owned a weapon.  I hated weapons.  I hated even to\n",
      "look at a weapon.  I would have thrown it away.  I never carried a\n",
      "weapon, and if someone can prove otherwise, they're welcome to have a go.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Now, I'd like to draw your attention to June of 1992 and\n",
      "ask you, do you recall being arrested or taken into custody at some\n",
      "point?\n",
      "A.   Yes, I recall that.  I was on my way out.  There were civilians\n",
      "leaving.  I didn't join that convoy.  I wasn't able to.  My family left\n",
      "on that convoy, my wife and our four children who were underage at that\n",
      "time.  I headed down the Rzava river to this village close to Visegrad.\n",
      "The distance may be about one and a half kilometres, and then I came\n",
      "close to this place Boista [phoen] on the Rzava river, on the right-hand\n",
      "river bank.  This was day-time.  It wasn't night-time.  It might have\n",
      "been 9 or 10.00 in the morning.\n",
      "There was this - what should I call it - an ambush or whatever.\n",
      "I stopped right there.  There was some weapons.  You've got to stop.\n",
      "They said, Cross, and I surrendered.  They took me to the MUP building.\n",
      "I handed over my ID.  There were these lads over there, soldiers, I\n",
      "suppose.  They were drinking a little.  They gave me some, so I had some\n",
      "too.  It was a bit like that, and then Lukic Milan emerged, and he said,\n",
      "Where are your sons?  And then he slapped me over the head, the left side\n",
      "of my head, and that's why I still can't hear.  I thought my eardrum --\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Thank you.\n",
      "A.   -- had been shattered, and that's when I fell down, and then they\n",
      "took me away.  They'd probably been ordered to take me away, and that's\n",
      "what the --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you very much, witness.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:\n",
      "Q.   Thank you, Witness for that answer.  Just one follow-up question\n",
      "on this.  Now, you say \"they.\"  Were these army men or policemen if you\n",
      "know?\n",
      "A.   It appears that they were Special Police.  The car certainly had\n",
      "a writing on it saying \"Police,\" meaning they were police.\n",
      "Q.   Now, at some point you were taken to another facility.  Do you\n",
      "remember that?\n",
      "A.   When I woke up, I was drunk.  I looked around myself, and I\n",
      "appeared to be in some sort of warehouse, maybe a military one, maybe not\n",
      "a military warehouse, the JNA in this place called Uzamnica.  I saw six\n",
      "persons standing in front of me, and they were all familiar.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  May we -- may the court usher please bring up on\n",
      "the screen 65 ter number 178.63.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Witness.  Witness, you said when you woke up you\n",
      "were drunk.  Can you tell us what made you drunk?\n",
      "THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] The brandy.  I'd downed some\n",
      "outside the MUP building.  It was given to me, and I accepted because I\n",
      "was feeling quite depressed.  By this time, I would have drank poison if\n",
      "I had been given poison let alone brandy.  That's how it was.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you very much.  Yes, Ms. Sartorio.\n",
      "THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] It's not that they did anything\n",
      "particular to me, same as though we were in a pub or something, and they\n",
      "gave me some brandy, and that was that.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:\n",
      "Q.   Mr. Witness, okay.  Thank you.  Please try to wait for the\n",
      "question, and then you answer the question.  Thank you.\n",
      "Okay.  Could you look at the picture that's on your screen.\n",

      "like a friends, like friends in a pub.\n",
      "THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] They weren't being unpleasant to me\n",
      "or anything.  So after I'd been slapped, they sort of rued that.  They\n",

      "A.   This is Uzamnica.  Down here is the JNA barracks, and these are\n",
      "the warehouses.  This one over here was the first one.  There 's a path\n",

      "partitions inside, and we were in the mid-section, so to speak.\n",

      "military equipment, and we were in the mid section.  Here is where the\n",
      "women were, and over here, well, we didn't know.  We were in no position\n",
      "to know who was there.\n",
      "Q.   So how many months were you in detention at Uzamnica?\n",
      "A.   Twenty-eight months.  It was in June that I was detained, and\n",
      "then there was an exchange on the 10th of October at the brotherhood and\n",
      "unity bridge.  There were ten of us that got exchanged and eight ladies\n",
      "as well.\n",
      "Q.   Now, so for the 28 months that you were detained, were you always\n",
      "in this building?\n",
      "A.   Throughout.\n",
      "Q.   Can you tell me how many other detainees were in the middle\n",
      "section as you described it with you?\n",
      "A.   Up to 26, and then some people would be taken away, some new\n",
      "people brought in.  So this varied, but the maximum, to my knowledge, was\n",
      "26, perhaps 27.  Some only stayed briefly.  Some stayed all the way until\n",
      "the exchange took place.  Some mothers were taken away.  There were some\n",
      "private exchanges going on, as well, that sort of thing.\n",
      "Q.   Your Honour, may --\n",
      "A.   There were ten men left and eight women, and that was the final\n",
      "exchange.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you very much.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  May the photograph be admitted in evidence, Your\n",
      "Honour.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.\n",
      "THE REGISTRAR:  It is admitted as Exhibit P114.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:\n",
      "Q.   Sir, do you know the ethnicity of the other detainees with which\n",
      "you were detained?\n",
      "A.   All Muslims.  In January, when I first -- or rather, the first\n",
      "month I came there, there was among them a man named Pero Gacic from\n",
      "Gorazde.  He said he was a member of the Gorazde Territorial Defence.\n",
      "Maybe he was lying to us, but I'm just telling you what he told me.\n",
      "Q.   Now, were there guards guarding the place in which you were\n",
      "detained?\n",
      "A.   There were guards, two guards in a group.  We were locked up with\n",
      "a chain and padlock, and they were in charge of the prison or guarding,\n",
      "but either they didn't want to or they could not prevent outsiders from\n",
      "coming into the prison and beating people.\n",
      "Q.   I just want you to focus right now on the guards, and tell us if\n",
      "you can tell us what they were wearing and if you knew any of them by\n",
      "name.\n",
      "A.   I know quite a lot of them.  Their clothing was blue, but I also\n",
      "saw them in civilian clothes.  But if you want me to talk about guards,\n",
      "I'll start -- do you want me to talk about guards?\n",
      "Q.   No.  I just wanted to ask you a question about what you recall\n",
      "them wearing.\n",
      "You did name these guards in your statement, didn't you?\n",
      "A.   Yes, I did, but I can repeat it.  Do you want me?\n",
      "Q.   No, thank you.\n",
      "A.   I stand by the statement.\n",
      "Q.   Do you know the ethnicity of these guards?\n",
      "A.   Serbs.\n",
      "Q.   Can you tell the Judges what the living conditions were like at\n",
      "Uzamnica; and by this, I mean food, sleeping conditions, water, bathing,\n",
      "et cetera.\n",
      "A.   It was a warehouse, not a house, not a hotel.  There was hay\n",
      "under the windows and some army blankets we used to cover ourselves, and\n",
      "for 26 people the food could not be sufficient.  One loaf of bread was\n",
      "divided into nine pieces.  We got tea, some marmalade to spread on bread,\n",
      "and boiled eggs.  That was the first month and the second month, and as\n",
      "the number of us decreased, the food increased in amount.  We bathed\n",
      "outside the hangar, behind the warehouse.\n",
      "Q.   Can you tell me how much you weighed when you were released from\n",
      "detention?\n",
      "A.   42.\n",
      "Q.   42 what?\n",
      "Sarajevoat the exchange, after the exchange.\n",
      "Before detention, I weighed 62 kilos.\n",
      "Q.   Now, sir, I'm going to direct your attention now to ask about\n",
      "Milan Lukic and Sredoje Lukic, okay?\n",
      "A.   Please go ahead.\n",
      "Milan\n",
      "Lukic?  That's --\n",
      "A.   I did not.  Maybe he knew me, but I didn't know him.  I never\n",
      "knew him before that camp.\n",
      "Q.   When was the first time that you met Milan Lukic?\n",
      "A.   That time when I was taken into custody to the MUP and when he\n",
      "attacked me, slapping me over the head.  Maybe I had run into him before\n",
      "the war, but I had never noticed him.  I had my own business to attend\n",
      "to.\n",
      "Q.   Now, when you were at the detention facility, did you ever see\n",
      "Milan Lukic there?\n",
      "A.   Milan Lukic came occasionally.  He would beat a couple of people\n",
      "and then tell them, \"Now get some rest,\" and then he would go.\n",
      "Q.   Did you ever beat you?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  He pressed me against the pillar in the warehouse, and he\n",
      "kicked me from behind.  One time he chased me across the warehouse.  He\n",
      "put his foot on my back.  When I fell, I tried to crawl forward, and he\n",
      "did the same thing to some other people as well.\n",
      "Q.   Now, you said you didn't know him before the war, so how did you\n",
      "come to learn that his name was Milan Lukic?\n",
      "A.   It was another man in detention, Saban Muratagic, who told me.  I\n",
      "Milanis\n",
      "Milan\n",
      "didn't beat that man, and I was wondering why he was spared.\n",
      "Q.   Now, did anyone else beat you other than Milan Lukic during your\n",
      "time in detention?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  Once there was Milan Spasojevic, called Mico, and he took\n",
      "out me and Mustafa Cuprija, a neighbour of mine.  He was four years older\n",
      "than I.  He gave us some sticks to beat each other with three times each.\n",
      "He hit me three times, and it was very painful, and I hit him three\n",
      "times, but this man, \"You're not doing it well enough.  You don't want to\n",
      "beat each other?\"  He took the sticks from us and beat us.  This man was\n",
      "sick.  He had trouble with his blood sugar, and he was peeing blood.\n",
      "This same Mico --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you very much, Witness.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Just -- now, before the war, did you know a person by the\n",
      "name of Sredoje Lukic?\n",
      "A.   Yes, I did.  He was an employee of the MUP, the Visegrad station\n",
      "of the MUP.\n",
      "Q.   And did you ever see Sredoje Lukic at the Uzamnica detention\n",
      "facility?\n",
      "A.   I recognised him only once.  It was in the later months.  It\n",
      "could have been July or perhaps August.  He came once when there were few\n",
      "of us.  Actually, at that time I was alone in that prison.  He came with\n",
      "Milan.  And when I saw him with\n",
      "look to me like a man of that kind.\n",
      "took that man, Semso Poljo, a\n",
      "retired man from Bijeli Potok who was at that time was over 70, and he\n",
      "took that man away, and again, I stayed alone.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  So when you say, he -- he hit me several times, do you\n",
      "mean Sredoje Lukic hit you several times?\n",
      "MR. CEPIC:  Leading.  Leading.  I'm sorry, Your Honour.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, that's very leading.\n",
      "took that man and\n",
      "said, \"Hit him.  Hit him.\"  I don't know how he felt about it.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Who beat you several times?  Who was it that hit\n",
      "you several times?\n",
      "THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Sredoje.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Ms. Sartorio.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  I'm sorry, Your Honour, about that.\n",
      "Q.   Now, sir, when you saw Milan Lukic at the detention facility, did\n",
      "you see him -- other than beating detainees, did you see him doing\n",
      "anything else?\n",
      "A.   He probably knew those detainees by name.  He called out Enes\n",
      "Dzaferovic and his brother and another young man, Omerovic, the son of\n",
      "Himzo Omerovic, and said, \"You are going for the weekend to Bajina\n",
      "Basta,\" and he took those three men away.\n",
      "Q.   Did you know these three men personally?\n",
      "A.   Yes, I did.\n",
      "Q.   And since --\n",
      "A.   They're from -- Enes Dzaferovic and his brother lived close to\n",
      "the MUP.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Thank you, sir.\n",
      "A.   Whereas Himzo Omerovic's son was from --\n",
      "THE INTERPRETER:  The interpreter didn't hear from where.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Sir, you knew these -- the answer was yes, you knew these\n",
      "three men personally, right?  Okay.  Now --\n",
      "A.   I knew them.\n",
      "Q.   -- since --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Let us just find out where the son was from.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  Okay.\n",
      "Q.   Can you tell us again, sir, where the son was from?\n",
      "A.   He was detained with his father.  The brothers, fathers, and sons\n",
      "were locked up together.\n",
      "Q.   I think the question is, do you know what village or municipality\n",
      "they were from?\n",
      "Visegrad.  But this Omerovic was from\n",
      "Dusce, a suburb of Visegrad where the furniture factory is.\n",
      "Milantook out these men, did you -- have you ever\n",
      "seen these men again?\n",
      "A.   Never.\n",
      "Q.   Have you spoken with their family members?\n",
      "Sarajevo, perhaps a year later I ran\n",
      "into his father - because he was a driver for the furniture company Varda\n",
      "- , and I asked him, \"Did your sons come back?\"  He had\n",
      "heard stories that they were alive, but he said, \"Never.  Never, Nurko.\"\n",
      "MilanLukic take -- no.  Don't -- wait for the\n",
      "question, please.  Did you see Milan Lukic take other people away?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   And on how many occasions did you see this?\n",
      "A.   He took away -- there were two more occasions after this one.\n",
      "Q.   And did you know the people whom he took away?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   And have you ever seen any of these people since that time he\n",
      "took them away?\n",
      "A.   No.\n",
      "Q.   Do you know anyone who has ever seen the people whom he took\n",
      "away?\n",
      "A.   No one has ever said that those people have come back to their\n",
      "families or that they were alive.\n",
      "Q.   Now, you grew up in the Visegrad area.  You said that earlier.\n",
      "Is that correct?\n",
      "A.   Yes, always.  That's the municipality where I was born and where\n",
      "I spent all my life until all this happened.\n",
      "Q.   Did you know anyone before this happened?  Did you know anyone by\n",
      "the name of Milan Lukic, who went by the name Milan Lukic?\n",
      "A.   No.  I mean, no.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you, sir.\n",
      "A.   I know about the guards and the movement of commanders.  One only\n",
      "was from Zenica, and the other three guard commanders were from Visegrad.\n",
      "Q.   None of those guards were called Milan Lukic, were they?\n",
      "A.   No.  There was one Milan Zecevic and Ilija Zecevic.  Those two\n",
      "were brothers.\n",
      "Q.   All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.\n",
      "A.   I even know them.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Are you familiar with the area in Visegrad known as\n",
      "Mahala?\n",
      "A.   Of course.  I grew up there.  It's a part of Visegrad.  Some\n",
      "people say it's a suburb, but it's a town unto itself.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Thank you.\n",
      "A.   Nova Mahala and my street was Dobrinska number 6.  Perhaps it has\n",
      "been renamed since.\n",
      "Q.   And the next question is, are you familiar with an area known as\n",
      "Bikavac?\n",
      "A.   How would I not know it?  There's a sports centre with bungalows\n",
      "and catering facilities, a hotel.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Cepic.\n",
      "MR. CEPIC:  Your Honour, my learned friend Mr. Dieckmann hasn't\n",
      "found anything in 65 ter submission for this witness related to those\n",
      "questions, previous two questions, Mahala, Bikavac.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Ms. Sartorio.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  Well, Your Honour, this witness is born and raised\n",
      "in Visegrad and can testify about the area of Visegrad, and I think\n",
      "it's -- it's background information about this witness, and --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  I agree.  I agree.\n",
      "What would your point be?\n",
      "MR. CEPIC:  We must be informed, Your Honour, in submission -- in\n",
      "65 submission about what will that witness testify, just to know what we\n",
      "have to prepare for cross-examination.  If he opens some new topics, we\n",
      "are little bit surprised.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Is this a new topic?  Isn't this in Visegrad?\n",
      "Isn't the area in Visegrad?\n",
      "MR. CEPIC:  Your Honour, nothing in the statements and in the 65\n",
      "ter summary is related to those two locations.\n",
      "[Trial Chamber confers]\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  Your Honours, if I may.  I'm not going to ask him\n",
      "about the Pionirska or the Bikavac incidents.  I'm simply going to ask\n",
      "him if he knows how long it would take him to drive from one area to the\n",
      "next area, if he knows.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  The question may be asked, and Mr. Cepic, if you\n",
      "can persuade us that you're in any way prejudiced, then you may do that,\n",
      "but not now.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:\n",
      "Q.   Sir, can you tell us how long it would take to drive from the\n",
      "Mahala area to the Bikavac area?\n",
      "A.   Well, it's a ten minutes' walk, and by car you don't need more\n",
      "than five minutes.  Visegrad is a small municipality.  You can drive from\n",
      "one end to another and around it in just half an hour.  It had a\n",
      "population of no more than 10.000.\n",
      "Q.   Now, at some point during your detention at Uzamnica, did the Red\n",
      "Cross visit the detainees?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   And did --\n",
      "A.   We were registered by the Red Cross a little too late, but after\n",
      "that they continued to care for us, and probably to the extent of their\n",
      "abilities they visited us, sometimes once in 15 days, sometimes once a\n",
      "month or once in two months.  They asked us about hygiene, food, general\n",
      "conditions, and we told them.\n",
      "Q.   Did you ever --\n",
      "A.   And one of us was always put forward to emphasise that everything\n",
      "was excellent.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you very much.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:\n",
      "Q.   My question -- the next question would be, did you ever tell them\n",
      "about the beatings?\n",
      "A.   We didn't dare to.  Detainees would tell one another, \"Shut up.\n",
      "Don't you dare tell them.  We'll get more if they hear that we've\n",
      "complained.\"\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Now, sir, I'm going to ask you, if you would, to please\n",
      "look around the courtroom in just a minute and take your time and look at\n",
      "everyone very carefully, and other than myself and Mr. Groome, I ask if\n",
      "you can tell me if you recognise anyone else in this courtroom today.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Just a minute.  Mr. Alarid.\n",
      "MR. ALARID:  Standard objection, Your Honour.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  We note it.\n",
      "THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I think the accused, right?\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:\n",
      "Q.   Can you tell us if you recognise anyone by name and, if so, what\n",
      "are their names?\n",
      "A.   You mean in the service of the Tribunal or among the accused?\n",
      "Milanand Sredoje.  We can stand up and\n",
      "look each other in the face.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  Can I just ask you, sir, to please, for the record -- you\n",
      "have to tell the record because they have to take it down, type it, which\n",
      "Milanand which one --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Will the accused who is standing sit.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:\n",
      "Milan, and if you can tell us what he is wearing,\n",
      "what colour he is wearing.\n",
      "A.   He's sitting.  Sredoje had just gotten up and sat back down\n",
      "again.  He's now wearing glasses; he didn't used to wear them before.\n",
      "Milanis not even looking at me.\n",
      "Q.   Can you tell me if you can distinguish between the colour of\n",
      "suits of these two men?\n",
      "A.   Their jackets are similar.  Sredoje has a white shirt and a tie,\n",
      "Milanhas a blue shirt and a tie.\n",
      "Q.   As you're looking at these two men, can you tell me which one is\n",
      "on the left and which one is on the right as you look at them?\n",
      "is on the\n",
      "left.\n",
      "Q.   And are these the two men that you saw at the Uzamnica detention\n",
      "camp and, as you testified to, who beat you?\n",
      "A.   Milan Lukic, and Sredoje I saw only once when he came together\n",
      "Milan.  I hadn't seen Sredoje before.  I am saying here without any\n",
      "coercion, and there were no secret conversations.  I want to say this\n",
      "forthrightly here, the whole truth and nothing but truth.\n",
      "Q.   Just a few more questions, sir.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  And, Your Honour, may the record reflect that the\n",
      "witness has identified the accused correctly?\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:\n",
      "Q.   Sir, can you tell the Chamber how -- what kind of physical or\n",
      "emotional or mental injuries did you suffer as a result of your detention\n",
      "and beatings?\n",
      "A.   Before medical and specialist panels, I was pronounced to have\n",
      "70-percent invalidity, so they sent me to retirement in Zenica.  And when\n",
      "I applied for remuneration on account of being a civilian victim of war,\n",
      "I started receiving some assistance as a former camp inmate and a\n",
      "civilian victim.  That's something that they started paying out later on\n",
      "account of damage to my health, et cetera.  The canton -- the cantonal\n",
      "authorities provided that.\n",
      "Q.   Can you tell us what your health was like before 1992?\n",
      "A.   I was healthy like a bull, one the best workers at the furniture\n",
      "factory.  I was the one who best dealt with the strain of night-shifts,\n",
      "and people even wondered how at my age I was so fit.\n",
      "Q.   Okay, sir, a few more questions.  In 1992, did you have any\n",
      "children and, if so, how many?\n",
      "A.   I had nine children, six sons and three daughters.  Out of those\n",
      "children, two were twins.\n",
      "Q.   And after the war started, did anything happen to any of your\n",
      "sons?\n",
      "A.   Yes, it did.  One of the twins, Samir, was taken away.  That's\n",
      "what I heard.  At the time when they told me, I couldn't believe it, but\n",
      "I wasn't an eyewitness to that.  But I heard that there is a witness,\n",
      "another boy who was then 14 or 15 who was taken away with my son together\n",
      "Drina\n",
      "Bridge, and I would actually forgive him a lot if I could only get the\n",
      "remains of my son back, but they were never found.\n",
      "Q.   Can you tell us --\n",
      "A.   My child is gone.\n",
      "Q.   Can you tell us how old Samir was?\n",
      "A.   He was not yet 15.\n",
      "Q.   And can you tell us who told you that your boy had been taken\n",
      "River?\n",
      "A.   This boy didn't dare tell me for a long time.  It was only five\n",
      "or six days after the event that he told the mother - my wife, that is -\n",
      "Samir was killed, it's very hard for me to tell you, and my wife fainted.\n",
      "He told us that he had been taken there and then taken back to the MUP to\n",
      "Milankilled our boy together with another man and\n",
      "killed Said Herceglic, another worker from my company, and I know all the\n",

      "Now, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions, and I was unclear\n",
      "about just what you said.  You mentioned a gentleman Lempa that was --\n",
      "worked at the factory.  Did you say that --\n",

      "Q.   And did you say that Lempa was killed with your son?  Is -- that\n",
      "was your understanding, but I was confused.\n",
      "A.   There was this witness who testified about Samir my son, and he\n",
      "said that Said was killed then too.  They called him Lenda, but his real\n",
      "name was Said Herceglic, the former employee of the furniture factory.\n",
      "He used to live in Nova Mahala.  I can't remember the street, but that\n",

      "Q.   How old was Lenda?\n",
      "A.   I was born in 1940, and he might have been born sometime around\n",
      "1936, roughly speaking.  He was several years older than me, quite\n",

      "where the story ends.  He never said he had been beaten.  I can't say\n",
      "that.  And he was released.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  Now, you say that you lived in Visegrad area your\n",
      "entire life.  Is that true?\n",
      "A.   That's true.  It was only in the last war, the first war back in\n",

      "that's true, but that's different.  That's Lucic.  Over at my\n",

      "A.   Two people would be brought in at a time, for example, and then\n",
      "there was this military warehouse, and we couldn't see who it was that\n",

      "people had been taken away.  Actually, new people being brought there.\n",

      "A.   I myself was interrogated at the barracks.  There was Ramiz Kulo.\n",

      "you were arrested, you worked at the Varda factory, correct?\n",
      "A.   Correct.  Yes, the furniture factory --\n",
      "Q.   And --\n",
      "A.   -- I was a joiner working with joinery machinery.\n",
      "Q.   And would you tell us when your last day at the factory was, your\n",
      "last day of work?\n",
      "A.   The salaries were distributed.  It was payroll day, maybe the 1st\n",

      "Q.   And your last day of work, if it was the May salaries paid June\n",
      "?\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  Objection, Your Honour.  The witness has already\n",

      "Q.   Could you please clarify because your statement says you were\n",

      "A.   I believe that that might be the day of my arrest, or the 19th.\n",
      "I'm not sure about the date, but I'm sure about the month.  It was June.\n",
      "But I'm not exactly positive, and I can't say, but the -- I think no\n",
      "later than the 19th of June.  Maybe it was my mistake.  Maybe I said the\n",
      "9th at the time, and maybe I said the 19th and it was simply misrecorded.\n",

      "Q.   I do not, sir.  One the other things that I'd like to ask you,\n",
      "though, is -- is because you indicate that before you were arrested you\n",
      "put your family on a convoy, and so I'm just trying to figure out, how\n",
      "long before you were arrested did you put your family on a convoy?  And\n",
      "I'd ask you to name the members of your family at that went on the\n",
      "convoy, please.\n",
      "A.   Four of my children and my wife and my two daughters-in-law, and\n",
      "then maybe there was another lady neighbour of mine.  They went to the\n",
      "Red Cross, and then I was there at the Rzava river, and I wasn't allowed\n",
      "to get onto that convoy.  I heard that people were getting off the\n",
      "convoy; I have no idea why, and then I started working down the Rzava\n",
      "river in order to reach a village called Okrugla because that was\n",
      "probably where the convoy stopped, and then the civilians assembled there\n",
      "in a bid to go through the woods and reach Gorazde.  I didn't --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you very much, Witness.  Thank you very\n",
      "much.\n",
      "MR. ALARID:\n",
      "Q.   Now, sir, can you remember simply the date of the convoy, and\n",
      "maybe referring to how long after your last day of work was the convoy.\n",
      "A.   Some left before my family left.  Where they left for is not\n",
      "something that I can say.  It was something that was organised by the Red\n",
      "Cross, the convoys.  There were just regular lorries, sometimes buses.\n",
      "Q.   Sir.  Sir --\n",
      "A.   And then my wife told me when I came eventually that they had\n",
      "been put on a lorry.  Luga [phoen] Gladanac was the driver and --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Witness, thank you very much.\n",
      "MR. ALARID:\n",
      "Q.   And, sir, can you tell me why your twin sons were not on that\n",
      "convoy?\n",
      "A.   Well -- well, they couldn't leave because it was taken away.  He\n",
      "never got to the convoy.  Only those that survived left on that convoy.\n",
      "My wife, my youngest daughter, and three sons, Almir, Dervis, and Enes.\n",
      "Enes was my youngest child, youngest male child.  And they were married,\n",
      "the two elder daughters, and then the oldest son was somewhere -- or,\n",
      "rather, along the front line, Crni Vrh or someplace like that, and then\n",
      "my two eldest sons, they were elsewhere engaged in the fighting.\n",
      "Q.   And so you're saying today that Almir was on that convoy?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  Someone caught him.  He was taken to the MUP building but\n",
      "they released him.  He said, I have a farm; I have to go and feed my\n",
      "cattle; it's under a half kilometre from the town itself; and then after\n",
      "working hours I have to go there; I have to provide for my family,\n",
      "financially, I mean, and that sort of thing.\n",
      "Q.   Now, you were exchanged from the -- ultimately, you were part of\n",
      "an exchange from the Uzamnica barracks.  Isn't that true?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   And --\n",
      "A.   The barracks, those of us who were there, they assembled us, and\n",
      "then further down some other people joined --\n",
      "Q.   Thank you, sir.\n",
      "A.   -- I don't know, and then they took us -- I don't know where we\n",
      "were taken through exactly because this was night-time.  I couldn't\n",
      "follow the route, and then at the entrance we spent the night there, and\n",
      "then they took as far as the Vrbanja bridge, and there was this exchange\n",
      "with the --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Witness, please try to make your answers as\n",
      "brief as possible.\n",
      "THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Oh, well.  Wouldn't I like that, as\n",
      "well, but I need to explain.  I need to make it clear, and then you'll\n",
      "understand.\n",
      "MR. ALARID:\n",
      "Q.   Now, sir, isn't it true that some people that were taken away\n",
      "from the Uzamnica barracks were taken away as part of exchanges?\n",
      "A.   There was a private exchange.  This was not the regular Red Cross\n",
      "exchange or organised by UNPROFOR, the United Nations, or whoever was in\n",
      "charge of organising those.  Hasan Balic was exchanged, and Ahmet\n",
      "Pergirudina [phoen] and Ilijas Cuprija.  It's like they were exchanged\n",
      "for some women.  Hajrudin, I saw at Visoko.  Ilijas, I saw later on\n",
      "twice.  He was arrested.  I saw him in detention and then after that,\n",
      "Sarajevowhen we came there.  And Hasim Balic, well, quite\n",
      "probably at the time he was -- he left or something.  I don't know.  I\n",
      "didn't see him, really, and then there was another exchange --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you very much.\n",
      "THE WITNESS: [In English] Yeah.\n",
      "MR. ALARID:\n",
      "Q.   [Interpretation] And isn't it true that on the day you were\n",
      "arrested, you were brought to the police station along with many other\n",
      "men that day by police who were arresting Muslims?\n",
      "A.   Well, there probably were a couple of people, not that I saw them\n",
      "myself, because this incident outside the station at the door or itself,\n",
      "that's something that I experienced myself, Lukic slapping me.  I was\n",
      "brought there by Todorovic Nebojsa and Popovic Goran, and they took me\n",
      "from there all the way out to the military warehouse, the one that you\n",
      "saw with the three doors.\n",

      "A.   I'm telling you what I saw.  If I didn't see something, I say it\n",
      "clearly I didn't see it.\n",
      "Q.   Just for the record, the transcript did not get the last part of\n",
      "my question, which is at the time of your arrest your two eldest sons\n",
      "were fighting.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.  We see that.\n",
      "MR. ALARID:\n",
      "Q.   And, sir, at the time that you were arrested was the first time\n",
      "that you --\n",
      "A.   In May.  In May.  The war began in May.  There were houses\n",
      "burning up in the hills, and then the MUP broke up.  How should I put it?\n",
      "People left, and then there was a lot of friction.  There were civilians.\n",
      "People were fleeing.  Some people were arrested, and some people left.\n",
      "This all began in May.\n",

      "what that 8-month period was?\n",
      "A.   Well, I don't really know how long that period was.  For quite\n",
      "some time he wouldn't turn up.  When did he turn up, there was this once\n",
      "he brought a pistol.  He stood in front of me.  I didn't know if he\n",
      "wanted to kill me or to protect me, and then the commander tried to\n",
      "protect me, and he said, Well, kill me but don't kill him.  It's like\n",
      "something was totally wrong there.  I can't really complain -- I'm not\n",
      "complaining about the specific people.  I'm just complaining about the\n",
      "events, about what actually happened.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you, sir.  And if I were to tell you that Milan Lukic was\n",
      "in gaol from February 1993 through July 1994, would that help orientate\n",
      "you?\n",
      "A.   Well, I'll try and answer that one.  In 1993, Guso Ramo and Gojak\n",
      "Ahmo were brought.  Gojak Ahmo was not from my municipality.  He was from\n",
      "Prijepolje, and Guso Ramo was from my municipality.  He was an employee\n",
      "of Varda, and he lived over at Banpolje.\n",
      "Gojak -- what did you say?  You were saying something about us\n",
      "Belgrade, and he said, No, I never said that.\n",
      "Well, there you go.  That's what Almir said, and that's as much as he\n",
      "said, and then Ahmo said, Okay, if you -- 2.000.  He gave him 2.000 marks\n",
      "Milanto --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Witness, thank you very much.\n",
      "THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] -- to let him live, and then there\n",
      "were other people from --\n",

      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Mr. Alarid, please continue.\n",
      "THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'd like it to be tighter.  Yes.\n",
      "It was loose.  Thank you.  It's good now.\n",
      "MR. ALARID:\n",
      "Q.   Sir, before we left, you know, one of the things I was trying to\n",
      "get an exact answer on or as exact an answer as you can give, is the date\n",
      "that you put your family -- I need to know the date you put your family\n",
      "onto the convoy.  And even if you can't remember the date, if you could\n",
      "tell me in relation to your last day of work or maybe how many days\n",
      "before you were arrested or something that can help us understand the\n",
      "exact date of that convoy.  Can you do that?\n",
      "A.   I don't know exactly.  It seems it was the 14th of June.\n",
      "Q.   And so you took your family, including Almir, to the convoy on --\n",
      "A.   My wife remembers everything better than I do.  She can tell you\n",
      "the hour, if necessary.  I should have taken her with me.  I think it was\n",
      "the beginning of June.  I can't remember the day.\n",
      "Q.   Do you remember how many days before the date of your arrest that\n",
      "was?\n",
      "A.   Well, they left with the convoy, and from that time on I went up\n",
      "the river where my feet took me.  I didn't dare to go with them on the\n",
      "convoy because I heard people being taken off.\n",
      "Q.   And when you were arrested, is it true that the soldiers had\n",
      "signs of the SDS on them?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   And is it true --\n",
      "A.   Most of them, they elected that party, that democratic party.\n",
      "Q.   Now, is it true that the police that arrested you had sniper\n",
      "rifles?\n",
      "A.   It was automatic weapons, not ordinary weapons, but those\n",
      "automatic weapons were of varying calibre.  They were automatic, but I\n",
      "could not distinguish because I was never familiar with weapons.  I never\n",
      "served in the army, and I never got a weapon myself.  An automatic rifle\n",
      "is better than an ordinary rifle.\n",
      "Q.   Sir, if I were to tell you in your statement in 1998 you\n",
      "indicated that the men arrested you had sniper rifles, would that help --\n",
      "would you defer to your statement?\n",
      "A.   Once at the barracks, this Dragan said it has this thing on top\n",
      "so you can see far and clearly.  I was never able to distinguish between\n",
      "weapons myself because I never handled them.\n",
      "Q.   Dragan who, sir?\n",
      "A.   Dragan Popovic, the one who captured me, and Nebojsa Todorovic.\n",
      "Q.   Okay.  And so that is -- that is the person that you were\n",
      "arrested by, correct?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  Those two arrested me.\n",
      "Q.   And these -- and these rifles had a telescopic sight, correct?\n",
      "A.   It had something like a small mirror.  You look into it, and far\n",
      "away things seem much closer up.  You can hit anyone.  If that's what a\n",
      "sniper is.\n",
      "Q.   And in your statement you indicated that they had camouflage\n",
      "uniforms, but you couldn't tell if they were army or police.  Could you\n",
      "tell me the colour of the camouflage?\n",
      "A.   One group was in blue uniforms, not light blue, and another group\n",
      "was in camouflage.  I cannot tell you very exactly now, but the blueish\n",
      "uniforms were the kind of blue like my shirt.\n",
      "Q.   And when you first saw Milan Lukic, isn't it true that he was\n",
      "wearing a blue uniform?\n",
      "A.   Whether it was their blue police colour, yes.  He wasn't wearing\n",
      "a camouflage uniform.  He was wearing what looked like a police uniform,\n",
      "not a camouflage one.\n",
      "Q.   And when you would see him at other times, did he have a blue\n",
      "police uniform on?\n",
      "A.   Sometimes he wore even a tracksuit.\n",
      "Q.   Now, before you were captured, when did the aggression start\n",
      "between the SDS and the Muslims?\n",
      "A.   It could be the end of May.  I don't know which day.  The army of\n",
      "the Uzice Corps left in the end of May, and after their departure those\n",
      "so-called Eagles came to the company in some sort of uniform, although\n",
      "some were wearing civilian clothes.\n",
      "Q.   And is it true that the Uzice Corps came to disarm the Muslim\n",
      "people and help the SDS take control of Visegrad?\n",
      "A.   It wasn't clear to us, for instance -- I asked one of the\n",
      "soldiers of the corps why the corps had come, and he said to protect the\n",
      "dam from Alija's extremists.  Somebody might close the dam and cause a\n",
      "flood.  But they did not act in a hostile manner.  Shells were falling,\n",
      "people dispersed, and this man said to me, \"We are not touching\n",
      "civilians.\"  There were very few people, and they said people can return\n",
      "to work.  I did go back to work in order not to lose my job.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you very much.\n",
      "MR. ALARID:\n",
      "Q.   Isn't it -- isn't it true that during this time the Uzice Corps\n",
      "were there they plundered the goods -- completely plundered the goods of\n",
      "Visegrad?\n",
      "A.   You mean the corps.  The corps did not take anything.  They were\n",
      "just there to stabilise peace.  They had suspicions that something might\n",
      "happen.  So when we went to work, we would encounter these three men from\n",
      "the corps.  We would pass through and then come to a point where we would\n",
      "have to show our IDs, and on the way back another group might check our\n",
      "IDs.  They did not act in any hostile manner.  According to some sort of\n",
      "agreement, they had to leave; and after their departure, chaos returned.\n",
      "These Eagles came.  Who they were, I have no clue.  When I asked other\n",
      "people, they said they were paramilitaries.\n",
      "Q.   Sir, do you remember giving a statement on the 23rd of December,\n",
      "1994, after your release from the Uzamnica barracks?\n",
      "A.   Later I gave some statements in Nedzarici when some lawyers,\n",
      "people from the court came.  I don't know their exact profession.  I gave\n",
      "them the lists of people I made, people who had been in the camp and who\n",
      "had been taken away.  No one knows where.  A few people were exchanged,\n",
      "and ten --\n",
      "Q.   Sir --\n",
      "A.   -- remained.\n",
      "Q.   Do you recall in that 1994 statement indicating that Medo Smajic\n",
      "and his wife as well as Safet Cavkusic and his wife were killed by the\n",
      "Uzice Corps as well as others?\n",
      "A.   I did not give that particular statement, and I am not familiar\n",
      "with their killing.  I know about Smajic, the employee of Varda.  When\n",
      "his son came to work, he said, \"You say there are no killings, but I\n",
      "found my mother and father dead.\"  And a woman from Donja Mahala said\n",
      "Safet Cavkusic and his wife were killed in their own home.  It's --\n",
      "Q.   And, sir, is it true --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Ms. Sartorio.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  Your Honour, I don't want to interrupt the flow,\n",
      "but if -- since Defence counsel to going to refer to a prior statement it\n",
      "would be helpful if he directs my attention to that section because the\n",

      "would be top third of page 2, I believe.\n",

      "A.   It's scrolling too fast.  I can't ... I think this date is\n",
      "correct.\n",
      "Q.   And did you -- and you did give this statement in 1994 after your\n",
      "release?\n",
      "A.   This part which I'm seeing right now, when the water was\n",
      "released, it says here in April, the water level increased and people\n",

      "Q.   Now, can I ask you a couple of other questions, please.  In your\n",
      "statement, a little bit earlier on page 2 of the English version, you\n",
      "say:  \"I also know that Serbs in Visegrad were armed and that the SDS\n",
      "with its Crisis Staff armed them.\"  Is that true?\n",
      "A.   I don't think people had weapons.  Maybe individuals had one or\n",
      "two, but those people were very well armed, and it couldn't have been any\n",
      "other weapons than those provided by the army.  If you ask me about this,\n",
      "I have an answer.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  You have about ten minutes left.\n",
      "MR. ALARID:  Thank you, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q.   Do you know the members of the Crisis Staff in Visegrad?\n",
      "A.   You mean soldiers?\n",
      "Q.   The SDS.\n",
      "A.   Well, in Visegrad most of them were members.\n",
      "Q.   Do you know --\n",
      "A.   It was a party that they established, I believe.  It was called\n",
      "SDS, and all of them in the Visegrad municipality were members of that\n",
      "party.  I don't know that they had any other party.\n",
      "Q.   And did the SDS extremists push the violence against the Muslims\n",
      "in Visegrad?\n",
      "A.   As I heard, they raised fears and encouraged the building of\n",
      "bunkers.  They said there was a threat.  I don't know why, why they\n",
      "needed to sow discord among people.  I suppose they didn't like that\n",
      "proclaimed its independence.  I wasn't there to\n",
      "see who clashed with whom.  I didn't see it, and I don't know how all\n",
      "this started.  When the corps left, it was then that --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you, Witness.\n",
      "MR. ALARID:\n",
      "Q.   One more question.  Are you certain that it's Milan Lukic that\n",
      "came to you in September of 1993 and beat you?\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  Objection, Your Honour.\n",
      "THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In 1993, yes.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes, Ms. Sartorio.\n",
      "THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Not only me.  He beat a number of\n",
      "other people, and he kicked me.  He had trainers on his feet when he\n",
      "kicked me and pressed me to the floor with his foot.  It was not only\n",
      "once, it was several times.  He beat other people and tortured them much\n",
      "worse than he did me.\n",
      "MR. ALARID:  Thank you.  No further questions.\n",

      "possible, and I would really appreciate if you also could try to be\n",
      "precise and short so that you could finish for all of us as soon as\n",
      "possible.  Did you understand me?\n",
      "A.   I understand.  It's clear.\n",
      "Q.   Before I start, please let me offer you condolences for your\n",
      "children lost in the war and behalf of the whole Defence team, and we are\n",
      "well aware of the pain and suffer you have gone through, and when I put\n",
      "my questions to you I will do it with all respect to your situation.\n",

      "Q.   Sorry.  Mr. Witness, in the course of the further questions, I\n",
      "would highly appreciate if you and myself just use the first numbers of\n",
      "this person and do not call them by their names.  Do you understand this?\n",
      "A.   All right.\n",
      "Q.   So if I refer to the person in the first line, I will call this\n",
      "person VG-25.  And if you refer to this person, I would be grateful if\n",
      "you could also say VG-25.\n",
      "A.   Okay.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  Mr. Dervisevic, do you know VG-25?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   VG-25 was together with you in the Uzamnica camp?\n",
      "A.   Yes, he was.\n",
      "Q.   Now, do you remember how many months you have been together\n",
      "there?\n",
      "A.   Five or six months, not much.\n",
      "Q.   Is it perhaps even possible for you to remember the specific time\n",
      "period, from which month and which year to the other month?\n",
      "A.   June 1992.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.\n",
      "A.   No, no, no.  I'm sorry.  It could be -- it was in the summer\n",
      "period, maybe August.  Yes, he was there, and he was sent to be\n",
      "exchanged.  He was there for a couple of months.\n",
      "Q.   So he arrives there in the summer 1992?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  Do you know VG-3?\n",
      "A.   I know.\n",
      "Q.   And again I ask you, have you been together with him in the\n",
      "Uzamnica camp?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  He even survived to the exchange when we were exchanged\n",
      "together on the 10th of October.  I know him.\n",
      "Q.   And could you also specify how many months you have been together\n",
      "in the camp?\n",
      "A.   He was captured in June, and he was with us all the time.  He had\n",
      "been brought wounded.  His leg was bandaged.  I think he was wounded.\n",
      "How, I don't know.  Maybe he was a fighting man of Ahmet Sejdic.  Those\n",
      "first two were fighting men.\n",
      "Q.   Is it June 1992 that he has been brought to the camp?\n",
      "A.   I think -- I don't think July has passed.  I can't be exact to a\n",
      "day, but the rest is all accurate.  I guarantee for that.  It's just the\n",
      "dates that I am not sure about.  Both of them are still alive.\n",
      "Q.   You have said that VG-3 was with you all the time.  What -- what\n",
      "do you mean by this?  Does it mean that he was with you together up to\n",
      "1994?\n",
      "A.   Yes.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  And at least I would like to ask you the same\n",
      "questions regarding VG-8.  Do you know him?\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  And he arrived also in summer '92 or later?\n",
      "A.   August, '92, late anyway.  You see, I said about '93, how they\n",
      "brought Ramo Guso and Ahmo Gojak.  Ramo Guso is from our municipality,\n",
      "from Banpolje.  And then he said all those houses up there in the hill\n",
      "were abandoned, those Serbs there.  People would go and pick up some\n",
      "fruit to eat.  Yeah, so he survived.  He's very thin, very thin and\n",
      "blonde.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  I'm very grateful.  Thank you very much.  All of you\n",
      "have been -- or have been forced to live together in one hangar, in one\n",
      "barrack?  Is it true?\n",
      "A.   We were all in one hangar.  That's what some people called them,\n",
      "but these were military warehouses and storage facilities.  We were all\n",
      "in one of those.  You saw that in the photograph with the door.  We were\n",
      "in the middle section.\n",
      "Q.   So you have had the opportunity to realise that when something\n",
      "happened to one of you, the other realised what happened to him.  Is it\n",
      "true?\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  Objection, Your Honour.  It doesn't --\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Yes.\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  I think the question doesn't make -- isn't clear.\n",
      "MR. DIECKMANN:  I'm sorry.  I will rephrase my question.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Very well, yes.\n",
      "MR. DIECKMANN:  Sorry.\n",
      "Q.   So when you live together in one room, you have had the\n",
      "opportunity to see if something happened to one of you.  If one of you\n",
      "has been mistreated or beaten, the other ones notices this.  Is it true?\n",
      "A.   Well, that's as long as it's something happening in this prison,\n",
      "but we didn't know about anything else.  For example, some -- somebody\n",
      "was taken away and we knew nothing about that.  The door slams shut.\n",
      "They take him somewhere.  If he's still alive, maybe he'll get in touch.\n",
      "He is no longer alive, okay, those who are in the know should say so.\n",
      "There are just these two persons who were brought in 1993.  They were\n",
      "there for, how long, maybe up to two months, Guso Ramo and Gojak Ahmo.\n",
      "That's as far as I know.\n",
      "All the time -- well, actually whoever was there had to be in\n",
      "that warehouse, and some people were taken away, and then the exchange\n",
      "came.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  One last question to this topics.  Is it fair to say\n",
      "that in comparison to the other three people that you have spent the\n",
      "longest time in Uzamnica camp?  Have you spent there the longest time\n",
      "from you four with 28 months?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  Yes.  I have documents showing that.  Were there other\n",
      "camps elsewhere?  No, not in Visegrad municipality.  Maybe there was that\n",
      "school building or whatever else they're saying, people being locked up,\n",
      "but this was a real military camp, the warehouse, and that's all I know\n",
      "about.  I don't know about elsewhere.  I'm telling you about what I went\n",
      "through and the people who were there.  How on earth am I supposed to\n",
      "know what happened elsewhere?\n",
      "Q.   Thank you, sir.  Mr. Dervisevic, you know Sredoje Lukic?  You\n",
      "know Sredoje Lukic before the war?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  Yes.  It's that man over there on the right.  I know him.\n",
      "We --\n",
      "Q.   Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  In the document tendered into\n",
      "evidence as P112, you said that you know -- knew him approximately 15\n",
      "years before the war as a policeman in Visegrad.  Is it true?  Is it is\n",
      "it your statement that you know him such a long time?\n",
      "MS. SARTORIO:  Again, Your Honour, could we have the reference in\n",
      "the statement, please?\n",
      "MR. DIECKMANN:  Yes.  Yes.  It is -- I'm sorry.  Is this page 2\n",
      "of this document, and it's from -- from the -- from the bottom one, two,\n",
      "three four -- the fifth from the bottom.  I can read it out.  \"I had\n",
      "known Sredoje Lukic for approximately 15 years prior to 1992.\"\n",
      "Q.   This is correct?  This is your statement, that you know Sredoje\n",
      "Lukic for such a long time?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  He worked there.  He had a permanent job at the time there.\n",
      "We would see each other in the Mirzalem [phoen] pub, and they would have\n",
      "drinks and that sort of thing.  He knows me better than I know him.  Yes.\n",
      "Yes.  We simply know each other.  He had a job there, and I worked in the\n",
      "furniture factory.\n",
      "Q.   If you think back to this time before the war, what colour of\n",
      "hair -- what colour has -- the hair of Sredoje Lukic?\n",
      "A.   Sredoje Lukic has brown hair.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, sir.  Mr. Witness, I\n",
      "put it to you that Sredoje Lukic never mistreated or beat you in the\n",
      "Uzamnica camp during the time you have been there.  Do you understand me?\n",
      "Milan, the\n",
      "two of them.  I was alone, and another man was brought over who was over\n",
      "beat him.  He slapped me a\n",
      "couple of times, and then that man was taken away, and I remained alone\n",
      "in the camp.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you, sir.  Thank you very much.\n",
      "I would ask the Court usher to call up the document.  I'm sorry.\n",
      "I don't know if the other Defence team tendered the statement from 1994\n",
      "into evidence, so I would call our Defence number.  I would ask the court\n",
      "usher to call 2D01-0288.  It is an interview to the Ministry of Interior,\n",
      ".  And I would ask to go\n",
      "to the page -- to page 5 in the B/C/S version.\n",
      "Mr. Witness, in this interview you have had the opportunity to\n",
      "give all names of victims or perpetrators you have been aware of and you\n",
      "know, correct?\n",
      "A.   Yes.  I named the people.  When I gave statements, I named the\n",
      "people who went through the camp, some people who were exchanged\n",
      "privately, and then the people who came there for an exchange, and the\n",
      "rest I simply don't know about.  Some people were taken away, and I have\n",
      "no idea what became of them, and I don't know who does.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  And isn't it true that this\n",
      "statement was done just two months after your release from the Uzamnica\n",
      "camp, roughly?\n",
      "A.   Well, I couldn't have made this statement.  We used nothing in\n",
      "the camp.  There was no music, no letters, no newspapers, no -- I think\n",
      "that is nonsense.  It was later, after the camp, after my stay at the\n",
      "camp, and then I remember later because those people who went missing\n",
      "from Visegrad municipality, they were no longer there, but I knew about\n",
      "that, and I wrote down the names, and may somebody tell me I didn't.  I\n",
      "know what I know, and I'll say what I know.  About 60 people --\n",
      "Q.   Thank you, sir.\n",
      "JUDGE ROBINSON:  Thank you.\n",
      "MR. DIECKMANN:\n",

      "you and look on the left side of the screen, is it your signature you can\n",
      "see on the left side?\n",

      "A.   What do you mean?  I was milking the cows.\n",
      "Q.   Can you --\n",
      "A.   I was never taken back to town for maybe six months.  You know, I\n",

      "The starting time of the session can be flexible also, depending\n",
      "on something that happens practically in the Court, and yesterday\n",
      "we had some problems because the witness was very emotional while\n",
      "he was being asked by the prosecutor, and the prosecutors have\n",
      "not used all the times given to them, and for the civil parties\n",
      "we have observed that they have not used up all the times\n",

      "remind the Chamber, but I think probably it would not be\n",
      "appropriate if the civil party lawyer asked for like a half-day\n",
      "break for a witness to recompose him or herself.  Then it would\n",
      "be a long break for him, which could also affect the schedule of\n",
      "the hearing.\n",
      "We believe that the psychiatrists have already been employed to\n",

      "incite the emotions of the witnesses until he or she cries, so\n",
      "emotionally that it could even affect his mental fitness and, of\n",
      "course, the Chamber is well informed of this.\n",
      "To sum up, the Trial Chamber is very deliberate when it comes to\n",
      "the calculation of times allocated to parties, however, the times\n",
      "for objections have not been included in the allocated times to\n",
      "the parties.  So the parties could still exercise their full\n",
      "rights to use the full time allocated to them, except the\n",
      "objections or any matter that arises during such proceedings.\n",
      "We, as human beings, are cautious and we really take the concerns\n",
      "or remarks raised by the civil parties, and we really appreciate\n",
      "the civil parties to raise these before the Chamber so that we\n",

      "into any particular fact; for example, the fact of S-21 or the\n",
      "fact of S-24, Prey Sar.\n",
      "And, number two, have you been the direct of victim of the fact\n",
      "or you are here on behalf of your loved ones who were victims of\n",
      "S-21 or S-24, or you were here as the victim of both facts?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I am here to be on behalf of myself who is the\n",
      "victim of the regime because I had been beaten severely and my\n",
      "wife disappeared, and I don't know where she has gone or how she\n",

      "you have come across during the Khmer Rouge regime after the 17th\n",
      "of April 1975 until the 7th of January 1979?\n",
      "A. After the 17th April 1975, I was ordered by Angkar to work in\n",
      "the technical school in Ruessei Keo.  I did the drawing and the\n",
      "sketches for the workshop participants.  It was at the technical\n",
      "school in Ruessei Keo.\n",
      "Q. You can just continue to describe your accounts from the time\n",
      "that you were at the Ruessei Keo Technical School until you were\n",
      "free from the Tuol Sleng on the 7th of January 1979.  If you can,\n",

      "If you can not, then the Chamber would put some questions to you\n",
      "based on the certain periods of the events.\n",
      "A. Mr. President, during the times that I served at the Ruessei\n",
      "Keo Technical School, I had worked for about one year; I cannot\n",
      "recall exactly.  My apology if I cannot recall the exact date due\n",
      "to the serious torture that I received.  So my memory is not in\n",
      "great shape.\n",
      "In 1976, Angkar arrested my superior, Hak, from the Ruessei Keo\n",
      "Technical School.  Two or three months later, the Southwest Group\n",
      "came to take control of that school.  I was then transferred to\n",
      "Ta Lei Co-operative in Dangkao Commune, Dangkao district, Dangkao\n",
      "province.  It was the co-operative with the education site.\n",
      "At that time, I was forced by Angkar to dig canals from Ta Lei\n",
      "village to the Prey Sar prison.  I was forced to build dams, to\n",
      "dig canals actively, so I was so severely physically used to\n",
      "provide the labour to Angkar.  It was to the limit of my physical\n",
      "stance to do that labour.\n",
      "Later on, Angkar ordered me to the group of adult people to make\n",
      "ploughs and some other wooden tools, rakes, and the chief of the\n",
      "group was Pak.  We called him Brother Pak.  It was still at the\n",
      "Ta Lei Co-operative.\n",
      "And later on, I was assigned to plant vegetables, and while I was\n",
      "working the soil at the vegetable beds, I grew cabbage, and over\n",
      "there we use human fertilizer.  It was called fertilizer number\n",
      "one.\n",
      "And one day, there was a group of people in black clothes.  I\n",
      "think they were driving a Jeep, if I can recall correctly.  At\n",
      "that time, I was planting eggplants.  I was told by that group\n",
      "that Angkar required me and my wife to prepare my belonging in\n",
      "order to teach the children at the school of fine arts.\n",
      "By hearing that, I thought that would be right because it's my\n",
      "expertise.  So I was happy, very happy, and I thought that I\n",
      "would now work in my right profession.  However, unfortunately,\n",
      "at that time when I was in the car with my wife in that Jeep, I\n",
      "was taken to a location near Kirirom location and I thought that\n",
      "was not the way to the school of fine arts.\n",
      "I felt uneased and I felt a bit scared and I felt I was dizzy.\n",
      "For about a half-an-hour later, we reached a location which was\n",
      "unknown to me at the time and the chief stopped there.  And we\n",
      "entered a house which was near by the Tuol Sleng prison or the\n",
      "S-21 Office.  There was a house opposite that office.\n",
      "They had two rows of chairs and we were asked to get off the car\n",
      "and we went to sit on the chairs.  Then there was a person who\n",
      "ordered me to put my hands behind my back, so my wife and I put\n",
      "our hands behind our backs and they cuffed our hands.\n",
      "Then my wife started crying and said, \"What do I do wrong?  We\n",
      "both are orphans.\"  I was so pitiful of my wife.  At that time,\n",
      "they used a piece of black cloth to blindfold both of us, my wife\n",
      "and I.  Then we were walked into the S-21 Security Office or Tuol\n",
      "Sleng prison.  Then I realized that was a prison.  From then\n",
      "onward, I was asked to enter a room and I was photographed.\n",
      "After they photographed my wife, then they photographed me, and\n",
      "that was the only photograph of my wife that I have had with me\n",
      "until today because I lost all the photos from the 7th of January\n",
      "1979.  And with me I only have a photo of my wife that I would\n",
      "like to show to the judges.\n",
      "After we were photographed, we were walked to Building C and from\n",
      "that time onward, I separated from my wife.  I did not know which\n",
      "building she was taken to.\n",
      "So I was placed in the common room on the upper floor.  I think\n",
      "about five months or one year later, I received torture.  First,\n",
      "I was threatened that they would peel my skin.  I didn't know\n",
      "what it means by that, but a person who slept next to me told me\n",
      "that it means that you will be beaten during the interrogation\n",
      "and I felt so horrified in my mind.  I was so shocked.  I\n",
      "thought, what mistake did I make?  I tried my best to serve\n",
      "Angkar.  And in the end, I became and fell into such a situation\n",
      "so I kept thinking.\n",
      "While I was in the prison, all the clothes were stripped off\n",
      "except my underwear.  So I slept directly on the floor for\n",
      "several months.\n",
      "Then they started to interrogate me and beat me up.  It was --\n",
      "the interrogation location was in a house outside the compound.\n",
      "It was behind the Building A.  They cut me and they asked me to\n",
      "lie down on the floor with my face facing down and they had a\n",
      "bunch of sticks and they dropped it on the floor and it made\n",
      "noise.  And I was asked to choose which stick I preferred.  And I\n",
      "responded, \"Whichever stick I choose, it is still a stick that\n",
      "you will use to beat me up so it is up to you, Brother, to decide\n",
      "which one you want to use.\"\n",
      "Mam Nai stood up and grabbed a stick and started to beat me up.\n",
      "After he felt exhausted, then another person came to take turn to\n",
      "beat me up.  So that Mam Nai was Mam Nai alias Chan.  He got his\n",
      "skin condition with a spotty skins and quite a red in his face.\n",
      "He asked me to count the lashes and when I counted up to 10\n",
      "lashes, he said, \"How come you count to 10 lashes?  I only beat\n",
      "you for one lash.\"\n",
      "I was -- I felt so painful at the time.  There were wounds --\n",
      "many wounds on my back and the blood was on the floor flowing\n",
      "from my back.  Whips were also used to torture me.  I was so\n",
      "shocked and painful.\n",
      "Every time they beat me up, they asked me questions; when did I\n",
      "join the CIA and, \"Who introduced you into the CIA network and\n",
      "what was their name?\"  And I responded that I did not know.  So\n",
      "the first beating, I responded I did not know.  The second time\n",
      "of the beating, the third times; I gave the same response.  Even\n",
      "if my back had wound, they beat on that wound.  It was so painful\n",
      "and I could not think of any mistake that I made.  I did not know\n",
      "what CIA or KGB network was; then how could I respond?  So they\n",
      "just kept beating me up.  I had a lot of scars on my back as\n",
      "evidence from that torture.\n",
      "In my mind, I thought of my mother; that if I could live, I would\n",
      "pray.  Probably it's because of my mother that gave me birth.\n",
      "And I would -- and I thought that if I could lived to give my\n",
      "story to the Chamber and now, finally, I am before the ECCC and\n",
      "that the ECCC would  find justice for me.  And I feel so happy\n",
      "even if 100 percent of justice cannot be provided by the Chamber,\n",
      "50 or 60 percent of justice to me is fine because I determined\n",
      "from the prison where I was detained that I had not committed any\n",
      "mistake or offence and that I prayed just to be survived.\n",
      "Q. Uncle Meng, please try to recompose yourself so that you would\n",
      "have the\n",
      "opportunity to tell your story.\n",
      "As you have stated, you have been waiting for this opportunity to\n",
      "tell your accounts, your experience and the sufferings that you\n",
      "received from those unjust acts; from the torture committed by\n",
      "the Khmer Rouge, as well as the ill treatment on your wife.  So\n",
      "please try to be strong, recompose yourself so that you are in a\n",
      "better position to recount what they did on you so that the\n",
      "public and the Chamber who are participating in this proceeding\n",
      "or the Cambodian people as a whole as well as the international\n",
      "community to hear, to understand the acts committed by the Khmer\n",
      "Rouge clique on you and that they would express the pityness on\n",
      "you as you received those ill treatment from them.  So do not let\n",
      "your emotion overwhelm you.  So try to grab the opportunity to\n",
      "tell your accounts to the Chamber as well as to the public.\n",
      "Uncle Meng, do you understand what I said?\n",
      "A. Yes, Mr. President; I understand.\n",
      "Q. Please try to recompose and be strong.  Today is the\n",
      "opportunity for you to reveal, to describe your sufferings to the\n",
      "Chamber so that the Chamber can understand.  If your emotion\n",
      "overwhelms you, then it's unlikely that we have another time to\n",
      "hear your account because the Chamber has scheduled other\n",
      "witnesses to provide the testimonies and they had gone through\n",
      "similar experiences, either at S-21 or Prey Sar -- although some\n",
      "of them are not the direct victims but they're relatives or\n",
      "family members, wives, husbands, parents -- received the unjust\n",
      "acts over there.\n",
      "So, in summary, please continue to recount the experience and the\n",
      "sufferings that you received from those unjust acts during the\n",
      "time that you were detained until the day you were free from that\n",
      "prison, thanks to the National United Front for Salvation armies\n",
      "on the 7 January '79.  Do you understand what I said?\n",
      "A. Yes, I can continue, Mr. President.\n",
      "Let me go back a little bit because I forgot to talk about the\n",
      "food ration in the common room.  In that common room, there were\n",
      "about 30 or 40 of us and at one corner I saw foreigners with\n",
      "light complexions and they were detained there as well, and they\n",
      "received the same food ration; that is, very thin gruel.  There\n",
      "was no rice grain in there, just one (inaudible) or one there,\n",
      "and I was so skinny I had no strength.  Even if I had a stick, I\n",
      "would not be able to use it to attack them.\n",
      "When Him Huy took me to the upper floor, he rode on my neck, on\n",
      "my shoulder, and I stumbled on the stairs and my knee was hurt\n",
      "and there was a wound on my knee.  So when I think of those\n",
      "events, I felt so painful.\n",
      "Each day when they took me for interrogation they took me twice,\n",
      "from 7 to 12 in the morning, and in the afternoon from 2 to\n",
      "or \n",
      " \n",
      "          6\n",
      "p.m.  The interrogators who beat me up, I could recognize their            7   faces because when they talked to each other, I recognized their\n",
      "names.\n",
      "They were Brother Mam Nai, Comrade Hor, Comrade Huy, Comrade Tith\n",
      "and Peng, so there were five of them altogether.  My apology that\n",
      "I went back to describe this account because I forgot.\n",
      "Q. As I told you, please try to re-compose yourself.  This is the\n",
      "day that you have been waiting for for so long.  I know you are\n",
      "very emotional now and probably you will miss certain events that\n",
      "you would want to recount.  Of course, the sufferings you and\n",
      "your wife received were indescribable and right now the Chamber\n",
      "would like to ask you some questions.\n",
      "When there was a vehicle going to pick you up from the Ta Lei\n",
      "Co-operative in Dangkao district to the School of Fine Arts, were\n",
      "you tied or cuffed, and what about your wife?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, Your Honours, at that time I saw a vehicle but\n",
      "there were no cuffs in there.  We were asked to pack our clothes,\n",
      "so I had some clothes so I put them in my backpack and they were\n",
      "all taken away at Tuol Sleng.\n",
      "Q. When they took you to Tuol Sleng, did they take you to Tuol\n",
      "Sleng straight away or were you taken to another place first?\n",
      "For example, like the place that you described where there were\n",
      "two rows of chairs.  Was it within the compound of the Tuol Sleng\n",
      "prison?\n",
      "A. It was outside the Tuol Sleng prison.  It was opposite the\n",
      "Tuol Sleng prison.  There was a house and there were two rows of\n",
      "chairs, and in the middle there was a long table.  So we were\n",
      "asked to enter that house and they ordered us to put our hands\n",
      "behind us and then they cuffed our hands, both of us.\n",
      "Q. When they ordered you to put your hands behind your back and\n",
      "then later you were cuffed, did they tell you the reasons for the\n",
      "arrest of your wife and yourself?  Did they tell you the reasons?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, at that time they did not tell us any reasons\n",
      "or any mistakes we made, and I and my wife asked them what\n",
      "mistake did we do and we told them that we were orphans and what\n",
      "mistakes we did?  And they replied, \"You, the contemptible, you\n",
      "don't have to ask.  Angkar has many eyes, like pineapples, and\n",
      "Angkar only arrests those who make mistakes or offence.\"  And I\n",
      "was still wondering what mistakes I did, and my wife wondered the\n",
      "same.\n",
      "At that time. I was in the adult group in the co-operative to\n",
      "make ploughs and rakes, and my wife worked in the rice fields and\n",
      "I could not think of any mistake that my wife and I made.  Until\n",
      "today, I could not think of the mistakes that I made at the time.\n",
      "Q. The people who ordered you to put your hands behind your backs\n",
      "and then they cuffed you and your wife, were they the same people\n",
      "who went to pick you up from Ta Lei Co-operative?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, they were different people.  They were not\n",
      "those who took me, who brought me from the co-operative.  They\n",
      "were there waiting for us in that room.  So once we entered the\n",
      "house we were asked to sit, in a nice gesture, and later on what\n",
      "happened I already described to you.\n",
      "So I broke into my tears because I did not know what offence I\n",
      "committed.  If I stay home and did nothing, maybe I made a\n",
      "mistake, but I did not do that and I cannot think of the mistake\n",
      "I committed.  Whatever I was asked by Angkar, I just did.\n",
      "Q. Can you recall the day that you were arrested and taken to\n",
      "Tuol Sleng prison or can you recall the year?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I can remember the year.  It was 1977 when I\n",
      "was entered into the S-21 Office.  I am a bit weak on the month\n",
      "because at that time there was no calendar to see, so it's only\n",
      "just based on the thinking or estimation.  I think it could be in\n",
      "May or June in 1977.\n",
      "The reason why I thought it was in May or June because after they\n",
      "tortured me and they were fed-up with torturing me, there was a\n",
      "teenager about 16 or 17 years old made an announcement.  He said,\n",
      "\"In this room, who can do the painting?\"  So I raised my hand.  I\n",
      "said, yes, I can do the painting.\n",
      "And that person ordered another person to unshackle me and they\n",
      "then put a chain on one of my feet.  I was then walked from the\n",
      "upper floor of that C Building to the ground floor in order to\n",
      "meet Mr. Duch.  The reason I recognized him because when I was\n",
      "painting the portrait of Pol Pot, he was sitting nearby me,\n",
      "watching me, sitting on a chair with his legs crossed.  I did a\n",
      "lot of portraits, not only just for Pol Pot, I also did a\n",
      "portrait for Mao Zhedong.\n",
      "Q. The Chamber asked you to describe about the situation but you\n",
      "have not been able to detail what we asked you, so I would like\n",
      "you to please listen to the question of the Chamber step-by-step\n",
      "until the 7th of January 1979.\n",
      "I think would you please wait until the question is referred to a\n",
      "particular section that you can respond otherwise you would not\n",
      "be able to recall the consequential event.  So could you please\n",
      "be waiting for the question from the Chamber before you could\n",
      "respond to them?\n",
      "When you were arrested and sent to S-21, were you sent in at\n",
      "night or in the daytime?\n",
      "A. It was at about 9 or 10, I can't remember it well, and when I\n",
      "reached Tuol Sleng there was no clock that I could check the\n",
      "time, but it was during the daytime not at night.\n",
      "Q. When you were handcuffed all together with your wife and\n",
      "walked into Tuol Sleng compound, were you both blindfolded?\n",
      "A. We were blindfolded before we were walked into Tuol Sleng\n",
      "compound.\n",
      "Q. You stated earlier that when you entered the location you were\n",
      "taken photograph.  Before the photos were taken, did they ask you\n",
      "for your biography or was it done later after the photography?\n",
      "A. I don't remember all.  Please accept my apologies.\n",
      "I think the document from Tuol Sleng still survives and the\n",
      "person who kept the record was Ti (phonetic), and I was shocked\n",
      "and confused because I did not know why I was arrested and I did\n",
      "not know how I responded to them.  I did not know whether my\n",
      "biography would have been sent to them earlier, prior to my\n",
      "arrest.  I'm not sure.\n",
      "Q. You said your wife and yourself were blindfolded.  Were you\n",
      "still being blindfolded while being taken photograph or were the\n",
      "blindfolds removed?\n",
      "A. When we were at the photo workshop then our blindfolds were\n",
      "removed, and we were seated and I was taken photograph and\n",
      "followed by my wife.\n",
      "Q. What about the handcuffs?  Were you removed from the handcuffs\n",
      "while being photographed?\n",
      "A. I don't recall having been removed from the handcuffs.  I'm\n",
      "not sure; I forget it.  Maybe the handcuffs were removed or maybe\n",
      "they were not.  But so far as I remember after our photographs\n",
      "were taken, then we were blindfolded again before we were walked\n",
      "to Building C.\n",
      "Q. You said you were stripped to your underwear.  When was that,\n",
      "before you were sent to Building C or only after you got to\n",
      "Building C that your clothes were stripped off?\n",
      "A. I think maybe my clothes were stripped off downstairs before\n",
      "we were walked upstairs or maybe only when we reached upstairs\n",
      "that our clothes were stripped off.  I seem to forget.  But as I\n",
      "remember, it is sure that after we were taken photographs then we\n",
      "were re-blindfolded and I did not know where my wife would be\n",
      "walked to.\n",
      "Q. When you reached the building, it was the common building for\n",
      "all prisoners or it was a separate prison cell for detaining you\n",
      "alone?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, at that time I was put in a common large room\n",
      "in which about 20 to 30 detainees were placed.  They all looked\n",
      "like hell because their hairs grew long, even they were male but\n",
      "their hairs grew so long.  I felt dizzy when I entered the room\n",
      "and I was so confused.\n",
      "Q. When you were being handcuffed, were you handcuffed and\n",
      "attached to the bar, the metal bar with the other detainees, or\n",
      "you were handcuffed and then isolated?  Could you please tell us\n",
      "about the condition of the shackles?\n",
      "A. We were put into the common rooms and in each metal bar\n",
      "resembled the shackles.  There were a lot of detainees attached\n",
      "to the shackles by our ankles, maybe five to 10 people for each\n",
      "long shackles and we were put to sleep head to head with other\n",
      "detainees, so my head was put against the east wall.\n",
      "Q. At that time could you sit up when your both legs were\n",
      "shackled to the long bar like that?\n",
      "A. I could sit up but we had to ask permission from the guards\n",
      "before we could relieve ourselves, although we were given an\n",
      "ammunitions box for such purpose and we were given a plastic jug\n",
      "for our urination.\n",
      "Q. Who collect the wastes or were they left with the detainees\n",
      "all day?\n",
      "A. At that time the people who worked there in the common cell,\n",
      "the person whose age was about 15 years old, would go up and\n",
      "collect the waste because the detainees would only be put to lie\n",
      "down in the cell and could not be moved.\n",
      "Q. You mentioned about the food ration, the thin gruel with very\n",
      "few rice grains and sometimes you would be offered a watery soup\n",
      "with water grass.  The question is how food was provided to you?\n",
      "Were you fed with a plate, a spoon or what was it like when food\n",
      "was delivered to you, and how often did you get the meals?\n",
      "A. When it was time to eat it was at 12 or 11.30; let's say\n",
      "between 11.30 to 1.  That's for lunch.  In the afternoon, late\n",
      "afternoon, the food was served at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. and when the\n",
      "food was carried to the place then they would leave it there, and\n",
      "if people made noise then they would be beaten with the stick\n",
      "that they used to carry the food to the detainees.  I felt very\n",
      "pity for them and for myself because we were treated like\n",
      "animals.  We whispered to one another, I mean to the neighbours,\n",
      "but we could not make loud noise.\n",
      "Q. Did the detainees have to share -- have to distribute the\n",
      "porridge or the gruel, or were they distributed by the guards?\n",
      "A. We were given the gruel on a plate by the guards, and after we\n",
      "finished the meal then the plates and spoon would be collected\n",
      "because they were afraid that those items could be used for the\n",
      "detainee to commit suicide, because every night people would come\n",
      "to search for any metal items or sharp items.  I did not know why\n",
      "they came to search for those items.\n",
      "Q. When you were thirsty what would you do?\n",
      "A. We had to ask for permission; for example, \"Brother, I am\n",
      "thirsty.  Could you please give me some water?\"\n",
      "Q. So it means in the common cell there were the prison guards\n",
      "who stationed there regularly.  Is that correct?\n",
      "Please wait until you see the red light before you respond.\n",
      "A. When I needed some water I would ask them for the water and\n",
      "they would give it to me.\n",
      "THE INTERPRETER:\n",
      "The President's mic is not on.\n",
      "BY MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. Now, you have not answered the questions about the guards who\n",
      "would be regularly stationed at the cell, and you said that when\n",
      "you would like to relieve yourself or you were thirsty you would\n",
      "ask the guard.  My question was:  were there regular prison\n",
      "guards at that location, and how many guards were there in your\n",
      "room?\n",
      "A. I think guards would be seen walking on the corridor, several\n",
      "of them, because we were locked inside and we could see them\n",
      "walking on the corridor, passing the windows.  And when we needed\n",
      "to relieve ourselves then we would call them.  But they gave us\n",
      "the boxes for relieving ourselves, although we were not removed\n",
      "our shackles.  But I seem to be forgotten when it comes to how we\n",
      "could ask them when we would like to relieve ourselves, but I am\n",
      "sure that we were shackled at all times.\n",
      "Q. I think we learned from you that there were the plastic jug\n",
      "and ammunition box placed for the detainees to relieve\n",
      "themselves, but when you were thirsty how could you do it,\n",
      "because there were no water jars left with water for detainees,\n",
      "so you had to shout to the guards?  I mean, if you shouted it\n",
      "means that the guards would be outside but if they were inside,\n",
      "the detainees would not need to shout to alert them.\n",
      "However, during the time when you had a bath -- because you were\n",
      "detained quite a long time from mid-1977 to 1979 and you were\n",
      "detained the longest there among the others, so when it comes to\n",
      "having a bath, what was it like?\n",
      "A. When we had a bath we would take off our shorts and then\n",
      "remove it from our legs, one leg at a time, and then we had to be\n",
      "naked and then the water would be sprayed from outside through a\n",
      "water hose, and some would get soaked, some would miss the water.\n",
      "And then we would use the clothes to dry the water.  It was so\n",
      "miserable because we would -- had been treated like the cattle\n",
      "while we were sprayed the water on.\n",
      "When we asked for water, of course we had to ask them for\n",
      "permission.  Otherwise we would never be given such water to\n",
      "drink.\n",
      "Q. You said you took off your shorts to dry the water.  What was\n",
      "the purpose of doing so?\n",
      "A. We only used them to dry the floor so that we could -- when\n",
      "the floor dried then we could lie down, because the water floods\n",
      "the floors and we had to dry it to make sure that it's dry.\n",
      "Q. So the purpose of removing your shorts was to dry the floor so\n",
      "that you could sleep on it.  Is that correct?\n",
      "A. That is correct, Mr. President.\n",
      "Q. How often were you sprayed the water on like this?\n",
      "A. Once every week or maybe once every fortnight.  I don't\n",
      "remember; you know, it has been 30 years or more already, but I\n",
      "know that every time we had a bath, everyone had to be naked.  It\n",
      "was like hell.\n",
      "Everyone would look the same and sometimes they mocked at us.\n",
      "They said that you guys look small physically but your thing was\n",
      "not that small.  I'm sorry to say that, but we would laugh by\n",
      "mocking on some other things, private things.\n",
      "Q. When you were detained, besides being removed from the\n",
      "shackles to be interrogated, were you released to do exercises,\n",
      "for example, every now and then or were you never allowed to do\n",
      "that?\n",
      "A. I don't remember it.  I think we were never allowed to do\n",
      "exercise in the room or maybe we were allowed to do so.  I am not\n",
      "sure because it has been so long already.\n",
      "Q. When you were taken to be interrogated, how was the process\n",
      "carried out?\n",
      "A. Every time I was taken to be interrogated, they would handcuff\n",
      "me and walked to the compound of the prison to Building A.  I\n",
      "think the previous trace of the building vanished over time and I\n",
      "think I could never take any visitors to the same original\n",
      "location as it already altered.\n",
      "Q. When you were removed from shackles, then you would be\n",
      "handcuffed before you would be walked to be interrogated.  Can\n",
      "you please tell us how this process would be carried out?\n",
      "A. I was walked to the interrogation room into the house.  We\n",
      "walked to upstairs.\n",
      "Q. No, I'm talking about the time when you were in the room and\n",
      "were shackled, and then you were shackled and attached to other\n",
      "people, other detainees.  And before you were taken to the\n",
      "interrogation room, would you be removed from the shackles and\n",
      "then walked outside of your room before you would be re-shackled\n",
      "again and walked to the interrogation room?\n",
      "A. They removed the shackles from the long bar.  The shackles\n",
      "were removed then they cuffed -- they put the cuffs on me again\n",
      "and then they walked to the outside area of the room, or the\n",
      "prison.\n",
      "Q. Were you blindfolded when you were being walked away?\n",
      "A. Of course, I was blindfolded while I was being walked away.\n",
      "Q. Could you please tell us about the moment when you were put\n",
      "into the room for interrogation?  How were you treated by the\n",
      "guards?\n",
      "A. They treated us -- they used derogatory language to me and\n",
      "they shackled me by my ankles -- the long bar of shackles which\n",
      "was about half a metre -- and then they locked the chain and then\n",
      "they closed all the windows and doors.  No, I think the windows\n",
      "would be left open because there were metal bars.  I could see\n",
      "Building A or B clearly.\n",
      "After I was shackled and they removed the handcuffs and removed\n",
      "the blindfold, and then they started to beat me to answer when I\n",
      "entered CIA and KGB.  I told them that I did not know anything\n",
      "about it and I could not answer anything about CIA and KGB.\n",
      "I kept repeating my response and they kept beating me and, of\n",
      "course, if we did not respond or answer to satisfy their request,\n",
      "then we would be beaten severely.\n",
      "Q. During the time when you were interrogated, you would be\n",
      "shackled and then you would be asked to sit on the floor while\n",
      "your handcuffs would be removed along with the blindfold before\n",
      "you would be interrogated.  In case you did not respond to what\n",
      "they wanted to get the confession from you, then you would be\n",
      "beaten with a stick.  Do I understand you correctly?\n",
      "A. They removed the blindfold and handcuffs.  They put me to lie\n",
      "face down and then they started to beat me until they had enough,\n",
      "and then they kept asking me when I entered CIA and KGB and who\n",
      "introduced me into the agents.  And I did not know how to respond\n",
      "to them because the person who worked honestly and worked the\n",
      "best to serve Angkar and never been involved in such\n",
      "organization, how could I respond to them that I introduced\n",
      "anyone into the CIA, even myself.  I did not know what CIA was.\n",
      "Q. You said you were shackled and put face down.  I find it\n",
      "difficult to understand because if you talk about the shackle,\n",
      "then you could sit up.  And how could you be put face down and\n",
      "then if you were shackled before that, you could not sit up\n",
      "because it was a wooden kind of shackles.  Then you put your legs\n",
      "-- or your legs were put into the shackle then you would not be\n",
      "able to lie face down on the floor.\n",
      "Or were you put to lie face down on the floor and tortured before\n",
      "they removed the shackles, and then -- or what?  Could you please\n",
      "clarify it to me or to the Court?\n",
      "A. It was not a wooden shackle, Mr. President.  It was a metal\n",
      "bar, long bar, designed to only put on one individual detainee.\n",
      "After having that long metal bar attached to my legs and my\n",
      "ankles, then they locked both ends and then they put me to lie\n",
      "face down in order for the interrogator to be able to beat me on\n",
      "my back and I could put my face down.\n",
      "Q. Were you taken to be interrogated immediately when you were\n",
      "sent during the first night at S-21 or were you kept a few days;\n",
      "only later that they would take you to be interrogated?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I was detained for quite a long time.  I think\n",
      "it was until May or June 1977 so I had been detained for four or\n",
      "five months before I was interrogated and tortured.  And as I\n",
      "stated earlier, then a guy came and asking for anyone who could\n",
      "paint.\n",
      "Q. Can you try to recall the S-21 staff who took you for\n",
      "interrogation and torture?  How many times were you taken and\n",
      "what about the types of torture?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, when -- for every times they interrogated and\n",
      "tortured me, they did not use or change the method.  First, they\n",
      "used a rattan stick or a whip to beat me up.  They beat me up\n",
      "with the stick or the whip for the two sessions.  So from 7 until\n",
      "12 or 1 p.m. in the morning, then I was allowed to eat and in the\n",
      "afternoon, they only stopped after 6 or 7 p.m. when I was taken\n",
      "back to the room.  After they beat me up, they did not take me to\n",
      "the common room.  They took me to the individual cell.  So every\n",
      "time after the interrogation and the torture, I was taken to the\n",
      "ground floor -- to the individual cell.  And for the mealtime,\n",
      "then we were fed with a bowl of food.\n",
      "Q. So in summary, you were detained in two different rooms.\n",
      "First, you were in the common room and about five months later,\n",
      "when they started to interrogate and torture you by using the\n",
      "stick, then you were detained in an individual cell.  Is that\n",
      "correct?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, that is correct.\n",
      "Q. Was your torture in a different method; for example, by\n",
      "electrocution?\n",
      "A. Yes, Mr. President.\n",
      "One day after they beat me down -- they beat me up, they walked\n",
      "me to Building D and there was a power outlet on the wall and\n",
      "then they used an electrical wire to electrocute me.  I felt\n",
      "unconscious and later on they used the water to pour on my face\n",
      "and I became unconscious again.  I did not know the voltage of\n",
      "that electricity, but once they started it, I felt unconscious\n",
      "immediately.  That was done in Building D.\n",
      "Q. I already asked you and you said that you did not know if you\n",
      "committed any offence so when you were detained in the prison,\n",
      "was there any decision by a trial committee to punish or sentence\n",
      "you -- for example, in a form of a trial in a similar form of\n",
      "this Chamber -- during your detention there?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, no, there was no judgment; no order from\n",
      "anybody.  We were just detained.  And one day after they\n",
      "exhausted by beating me up, then they walked me back into the\n",
      "room and while at the path walking to our Building D -- there was\n",
      "no concrete path there at the time  -- and at that juncture, I\n",
      "was beaten up again.  And another person came and said, \"Don't\n",
      "beat him up today because Brother instructed so.  Keep him\n",
      "alive.\"\n",
      "Because there were a lot of wounds on my back, I felt so painful,\n",
      "but because they beat me up so I had to lie down on my back.\n",
      "However, Him Huy used a stick to push under my back and a lot of\n",
      "gravels went inside the wound on my back so because it was so\n",
      "painful, then I had to turn myself again for them to beat me up\n",
      "on the back.\n",
      "Q. When did they decide to use you as a painter?\n",
      "A. One day, I was taken from that individual cell to the upper\n",
      "floor for treatment.  Actually, there was no medicine at all.\n",
      "There was a bowl of saltwater and they just poured that saltwater\n",
      "on my back and it was so, so painful because of my open wounds\n",
      "and the salt.  You could see when you used the salt on the frog,\n",
      "you could see the effects and you could imagine how painful it\n",
      "was when they pour the water -- the saltwater on my back.  And\n",
      "indeed, finally the wounds recovered from the saltwater.\n",
      "Sometimes, I was given a rabbit pellet tablet.  It was so\n",
      "miserable.\n",
      "Q. And now to the scars from the beating; do you still have the\n",
      "scars or are they completely gone?\n",
      "A. The wounds recovered, but the scars are everywhere on my back,\n",
      "on my shoulders.  They were the scars from being whipped or\n",
      "beaten.  Sometimes, there were five of them beating me up at the\n",
      "same time.\n",
      "Q. Can we see the scars on your back?\n",
      "MS. STUDZINSKY:\n",
      "Mr. President, I would like to make break now before Mr. Bou Meng\n",
      "shows his scars and to decide if this is appropriate -- an\n",
      "appropriate measure now and maybe it is time for an adjournment,\n",
      "and that would be great if he could get it.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Now it is time for a break.  The Chamber will take a 20 minute\n",
      "break until 11 a.m. when the Chamber will resume.\n",

      "(Court recesses from 10H38 until 11H02)\n",
      "(Judges enter courtroom)\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Please be seated.  The Chamber is now back in session.\n",
      "We would like to inform the parties and the public that the\n",
      "Chamber now cancels its attempts to show the scars on the\n",
      "survivor's back and all parties are also reminded not to proceed\n",
      "with the request to show the scars on the survivor's back.\n",
      "Do you have any further requests or observations?\n",
      "MS. STUDZINSKY:\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President.  We would suggest to proceed in closed\n",
      "session and then Mr. Bou Meng could show the scars to the Chamber\n",
      "and the parties.  That is something that could be a possibility\n",
      "to do.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "The Chamber already decided to cancel its attempts to show the\n",
      "scars, even if in an in camera hearing.  In case of necessity, it\n",
      "can be shown by photos.  So the photos can be shown of the scars\n",
      "on his back.  Bou Meng, you think you can have those photos for\n",
      "the Chamber?\n",
      "MR. BOU MENG:\n",
      "Mr. President, I do not have any photos of the marks.  I only\n",
      "have the marks on my body.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "The Chamber would like to request to take photos of your -- of\n",
      "the scars or your marks that can be displayed on the screen.  Do\n",
      "you agree to this proposal?\n",
      "MR. BOU MENG:\n",
      "Yes, I agree.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. Next, so you were chosen to be a painter.  When were you\n",
      "chosen?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, towards the later '77, because in early 1978 I\n",
      "already painted a canvas.  One day I heard the noise from the\n",
      "loudspeaker, I think they celebrated something at the Olympic\n",
      "Stadium, and we were given a lot of food.  We ate to our fill and\n",
      "the guards gave us the food.  And I even have the noodles,\n",
      "Chinese noodles to eat.\n",
      "And Nath said I had to jump, to jump up so that the food will go\n",
      "down lower through my stomach and I can eat more to fill to my\n",
      "stomach.  And I told him, \"Once you are full, you are full.  You\n",
      "only have one stomach to fill in.\"\n",
      "I think I started painting the portrait in late '77 or early '78\n",
      "because there were four portraits and each portrait, when Duch\n",
      "asked me, \"How long did it take to make that portrait?  And the\n",
      "portrait must look the same as the photo,\" and I told him -- I\n",
      "requested to have three months to make that portrait because the\n",
      "canvas was huge.  It was 1.5 metres wide and three metres high.\n",
      "I would like to seek your permission to show the portrait of Pol\n",
      "Pot that I painted.  I survived because I could paint the exact\n",
      "portrait of Pol Pot, so I was spared until to the 7th January,\n",
      "'79.\n",
      "This is my response, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. During the time that you were released to work by doing the\n",
      "painting, where did you paint and who else worked with you in\n",
      "that location?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, yes, I myself, Bou Meng; Vann Nath too; Im\n",
      "Chan, the wood sculptor and the wax moulder, another wax moulder;\n",
      "so that's all.  And we worked in Building E.  Building E is the\n",
      "building in the middle of the compound.  I think that is used as\n",
      "the reception area for the guests who come to visit the museum.\n",
      "Q. What about the food ration after you were chosen to work as a\n",
      "painter?  Was the food ration the same as those given to the\n",
      "prisoners?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, the food ration was better than previously, so\n",
      "it was from the thin gruel to rice and we had sufficient soup.\n",
      "So the prison guard carried the soup to deliver it to us and we\n",
      "shared among ourselves.\n",
      "Q. During the time you were selected to work as a painter, where\n",
      "were you allowed to sleep at night?\n",
      "A. After I painted and when it was time to sleep, it was at the\n",
      "generator's room.  It was behind Building E.  At that time there\n",
      "was a generator there, so when the electricity was cut off, then\n",
      "they started the generator and we slept in that generator's room.\n",
      "Q. Were you cuffed or shackled in that room or were you locked\n",
      "from outside?\n",
      "A. I was allowed to sleep in that room but I was not cuffed or\n",
      "shackled, so there was seven of us -- Oeng Bech, Vann Nath, Im\n",
      "Chan, Pha Tha Chan, Ruy Makong.  There were seven of us -- and\n",
      "Chum Mey.  I requested to see the photo: Pha Tha Chan, Bou Meng,\n",
      "Vann Nath, Im Chan, Ruy Makong and Chum Mey.  And now only Chum\n",
      "Mey, Vann Nath and Bou Meng are alive.  The other four died.\n",
      "MS. STUDZINSKY:\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to suggest to the Court\n",
      "officials to show the photo on the screen.  Thank you.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "I don't think it is yet your time.  It is now my question and I\n",
      "have the discretion.\n",
      "BY MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. During the times you were asked to do the painting, did you\n",
      "meet the accused, Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, Your Honours, at that time Mr. Kaing Guek Eav,\n",
      "alias Duch, sat next to me watching me painting the portrait of\n",
      "Brother Number One, Pol Pot, and he ordered me, \"You should\n",
      "adjust the throat.  It's not a tumour, it's just fat.\"  So as can\n",
      "be seen from this photo which was taken of the portraits that I\n",
      "painted, so you could see that the throat was slimmer.\n",
      "Q. Did he come to visit you often to see you painting?  And if he\n",
      "came, during the day or nighttime?\n",
      "A. He came often during the daytime and he wore shorts and a\n",
      "short-sleeved shirt.  So he came in, he sat with his one leg\n",
      "across and watching me drawing, for example, another portrait of\n",
      "the head of Ho Chi Minh on the body of a dog.  It was like a\n",
      "cartoon which they -- it was like a sketch of the sea with a\n",
      "flat, windy situation, et cetera and et cetera.\n",
      "Q. Did you notice his character and behaviour during the time\n",
      "that he watched you making the painting or the portrait?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, he did not really beat me up, however, one day\n",
      "I didn't know what I did wrong.  He asked me and Im Chan to beat\n",
      "each other up.  So we were given a piece of black plastic tube to\n",
      "hit, to beat each other, and he sat there watching us beating\n",
      "each other up.  After a while he ordered us to stop.\n",
      "But if I could make a very lifelike portrait, he would look at it\n",
      "carefully and I think I lost some of the portraits.\n",
      "Q. The question is, did you observe his facial expression or his\n",
      "behaviour; that is the behaviour of the accused, Kaing Guek Eav,\n",
      "alias Duch, during the time that he went to watch you painting?\n",
      "Was he a person full of joy or full of sorrow?  Did you notice\n",
      "that?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, his facial expression was normal.  If he needed\n",
      "to laugh, he laughed.  Sometimes he smiled.  I could see him\n",
      "through his face but I could not judge his feeling or emotion,\n",
      "and that's the word I was asked especially by a journalist, and I\n",
      "always tell them, \"I know his face but I don't know his feeling\".\n",
      "He was close to me, observing me painting.  Sometimes he gave me\n",
      "cigarettes to smoke.\n",
      "Q. Did he ever beat you up personally?\n",
      "A. No, but he ordered me to beat up with Im Chan.  I was not\n",
      "happy with that.  He did not treat me like a human being.\n",
      "Q. Did you ever see him going from one building to the next\n",
      "within the compound of the prison; for example, from Building A\n",
      "to B to C, or did he only enter the compound and only come to the\n",
      "place where you worked?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I did not see him walking along each building\n",
      "because when he entered his main focus was on the portrait of\n",
      "Brother Number One, Pol Pot.  I only saw him coming to my\n",
      "workshop.  I did not see him going anywhere else.\n",
      "Q. So besides him, besides you yourself, did you see him\n",
      "torturing or beating up other prisoners?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, let me go back a little bit.\n",
      "One day there was a Vietnamese citizen.  He boasted that he could\n",
      "make a wax mould and then he was ordered to show his skill.  So\n",
      "he was tested and Duch saw that he could not do it.  Then he\n",
      "ordered the interrogators to kick him like kick a ball because,\n",
      "from what I understood, he was angry that that person lied to\n",
      "him.  And I did not know what happened to that Vietnamese person.\n",
      "Probably he was taken out.\n",
      "Q. Did he himself order the guards or his subordinates to torture\n",
      "that person?  And if he did order, can you recall his exact\n",
      "words; that is, the words that Duch used to order his\n",
      "subordinates to torture that Vietnamese person?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I forget some parts.  I am not sure.  I think\n",
      "probably he signalled his guards to beat that Vietnamese person.\n",
      "And the Vietnamese person was taken away from the workshop where\n",
      "I worked.  So there were woodcrafters; there was a painter and\n",
      "another artist.  We worked in the same workshop.\n",
      "Q. You saw the guards beating up that person who boasted about\n",
      "his skill.  Was the beating taking place within the workshop\n",
      "vicinity in Building E or was he taken out and beaten up outsides\n",
      "that area?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, at that time the three or four of them kicked\n",
      "that Vietnamese person and beat him up and walked him away.  I\n",
      "did not hear his order.  So when those guards beat the Vietnamese\n",
      "person up, Duch had already left.\n",
      "Q. So during the time you were asked to work as a painter, how\n",
      "many portraits did you paint and whose portraits were they?\n",
      "A. There were four portraits of Pol Pot.  However, there was\n",
      "another portrait in 1981.  There was a German group to make a\n",
      "film on that portrait, so I showed the portrait to the person and\n",
      "then I used paint to make a cross sign on that person to express\n",
      "my hatred of that person, and that was filmed by the German\n",
      "group.\n",
      "Q. You said that you painted various other paintings or\n",
      "portraits; for example, a painting of a dog with the Ho Hi Minh\n",
      "head on it.  But for Pol Pot portraits you only made four\n",
      "portraits?\n",
      "A. That is correct, Mr. President.\n",
      "Q. So besides the portraits of Brother Number One, Pol Pot, did\n",
      "you make any other painting or portrait?\n",
      "A. Mr., President, yes, I painted Hua Guofeng, Mao Zhedong in\n",
      "large canvas as well, so the canvas was as big as the canvas for\n",
      "Pol Pot's portrait.\n",
      "Q. When you did your painting or portrait, did you do it\n",
      "individually or together with Vann Nath?  That is, Vann Nath was\n",
      "painting his own painting or portrait and you yourself had a\n",
      "separate painting or portrait?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, at that time he did not have a skill of\n",
      "painting black and white portraits so I mixed the black and white\n",
      "painting by myself with one litre of gasoline to burn it and the\n",
      "smoke would go into that painting and then I mixed it.  And Vann\n",
      "Nath did not have this skill.\n",
      "Q. So it means that your painting was separate from him because\n",
      "one was colour and one was black and white.  Is that correct?\n",
      "A. Yes, that is correct.\n",
      "Q. You talked about the portrait of Pol Pot.  This is one of the\n",
      "portraits of other people that you painted.  Is that correct?\n",
      "A. Yes, Mr. President, that is correct.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Court officer, can you take a photo of the portrait of Pol Pot to\n",
      "be projected on the monitor, on the slide?\n",
      "BY MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. Is this the portrait of Pol Pot that you painted by yourself\n",
      "during the time that you were detained there and then when you\n",
      "were asked to make a drawing or portrait of the leader of the\n",
      "Democratic Kampuchea?\n",
      "A. Yes, Mr. President, this is the portrait.\n",
      "Q. You stated just then that because of your skill of making the\n",
      "portrait that you survived until today.  Can you explain further\n",
      "the reason of this portrait that led to the survival?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, the reason, from my understanding, is that my\n",
      "painting is a resemblance of the photo, so I started painting\n",
      "portraits 1, 2, 3 and 4 and another one.  While I was painting,\n",
      "then the time came when the Vietnamese and the National United\n",
      "Front for Salvation army entered Phnom Penh and we fled.\n",
      "They gathered us to move from the compound in one long straight\n",
      "line without stepping anywhere off the line or we would be shot.\n",

      "The Court official, can you remove the sketch?\n",
      "BY MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. There are still some other documents in which you stated that\n",
      "you were sent to Prey Sar and then you stayed at Prey Sar for a\n",
      "while before you were returned to S-21.  What happened back then?\n",
      "Is it true that you were sent there?\n",
      "A. I think it is not true because I stayed in Tuol Sleng prison,\n",
      "but when we were evacuated it would be true that I was walking\n",
      "and reached Prey Sar somewhere near Boeung Choueng Ek for about\n",
      "five minutes, and then we later on were ordered to move to Prey\n",
      "Sar prison.  I think after about 10 to 20 minutes then we would\n",
      "be ordered to move further during the nighttime.\n",
      "Q. So you went to Prey Sar during the evacuation process when the\n",
      "United Front of the National Army actually liberated Phnom Penh,\n",
      "and you went along with the other people, so you were forced to\n",
      "move out with other people.  Is it correct?  I think you were\n",
      "leaving on the 7th of January 1979; is that correct?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, it's correct, we left at night in the late\n",
      "evening at about 6 to 7 p.m.\n",

      "The question is where were you up to -- I mean, you were at Prey\n",

      "please tell us about the date during the process you were\n",
      "marching or you were getting out of town that time?\n",
      "A. We left Prey Sar prison at night and we walked to National\n",
      "Road Number 4, and at dawn we saw the presence of the United\n",
      "Front army, and the guards who guarded us all the way while we\n",
      "were on our journey then left us.  And I could proceed with Pha\n",
      "Tha Chan and I did not know where the other people went to\n",
      "because Vann Nath also left us, except I and Pha Tha Chan who\n",
      "would be left alone, and we walked until Amleang and stayed at\n",

      "then I would too be in big trouble.\n",
      "Q. When did you return?\n",
      "A. When Nath came to Phnomn Penh ahead of me and along with Oeng\n",
      "Bech and Comrade Kong, and I walked with other people until I\n",
      "reached Pursat province.  And Vietnamese troops would be seen in\n",
      "several jungles.\n",
      "And at Svay Dangkao we could also see Vietnamese militaries and I\n",
      "was recruited as the soldier during that time.  I worked as the\n",

      "accounts of your story, because in your complaint you state about\n",

      "were taken and while you were blindfolded and put into the\n",
      "detention room?  Have you ever heard anything about your wife?\n",
      "A. After we were blindfolded and sent to the upper upstairs I\n",
      "have never known or seen my wife.  But at one moment when I was\n",
      "painting the portrait of Pol Pot, Him Huy was outside of the\n",
      "window and told me that, \"Your wife was working in the rice\n",
      "field,\" and then I told myself -- I thought that probably she\n",
      "would be kept there to be killed, but I did not tell anybody\n",
      "because I only were thinking alone.  Because I was also a farmer\n",
      "and Duch once said that people could be used as fertilizer for\n",

      "what happened to her.\n",

      "A. Your question reminds me the question that I would like to ask\n",
      "to Mr. Kaing Guek Eav, I want to know whether he asked his\n",

      "further questions concerning the time when you were detained and\n",
      "then later on, you were chosen to be the painter; the position\n",
      "you hold until 7 January 1979.\n",
      "During that time, had you seen or been aware of any activities of\n",
      "the guards at S-21 towards the other detainees?  Through your\n",
      "observation and recollection, could you please tell the Court\n",
      "about those events?\n",
      "A. During the time when I worked as a painter in Building E\n",
      "painting a portrait of Pol Pot, I could see through the window\n",
      "the sending of Vietnamese soldiers and the Khmer Rouge soldiers\n",
      "who were sent en masse into the compound.  I did not actually\n",
      "witness the torture, but I heard the screams; people crying for\n",
      "help all around the compound.  I did not see the tortures\n",
      "directly, but I did hear people crying for help.\n",
      "Q. When you were detained in the common room, did you see dead\n",
      "body of other detainees in the room and if you saw them, did you\n",
      "see them often?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I saw a dead body who was lying head to head\n",
      "with me.  He was with dark complexion, a small person.  He was\n",
      "taller than me.  He was about the same age as me.  If he would\n",
      "live, now he would be 67, 68.  A young guard stamped on his chest\n",
      "and he coughed with blood and he was lying dead there inside the\n",
      "common room.  At night, he would be taken to be buried in the\n",
      "compound not far from that.\n",
      "Q. So how long was it -- I mean, the interval between the time\n",
      "when the person died and the time when he was buried?\n",
      "A. I noticed that he was dead in the daytime and then late at\n",
      "night -- I can't remember when, but it was at night that the\n",
      "person disappeared and would be buried.  I don't know where he\n",
      "would be buried or discarded because I was still shackled and I\n",
      "didn't know more about something outside.\n",
      "Q. You were detained and shackled for a long period of time\n",
      "before you were let out to be a painter.  And have you noticed\n",
      "the people who were sent in and shackled along with you in the\n",
      "same room would be taken out and disappeared or had they returned\n",
      "or have you noticed that?\n",
      "A. I'm talking before the God, the Buddha.  I'm talking the\n",
      "truth.  People would be put into the trucks and carried away and\n",
      "they never returned.  And after being interrogated, I would be\n",
      "kept downstairs and I did not know much about the fate of those\n",
      "people, but when I was in the common room, people who would be\n",
      "taken away would never come back so they just disappeared.\n",
      "Q. What about the other situation, for example, when a detainee\n",
      "was so weak that he would be carried to the truck or to the other\n",
      "location?  Had you seen such scenes?\n",
      "A. I did witness the very thin person who were tied to his legs\n",
      "and arms, and a stick would be put to -- and then carried by two\n",
      "people.  He was carried like a pig, like people would be carrying\n",
      "a pig, and he was passing the place where I was painting, and the\n",
      "guard banged the door shut in order not to let me see them\n",
      "carrying that very sick and thin detainee.  I did not know where\n",
      "he was up to.\n",
      "Q. Were they carrying the dead body or a person who's still\n",
      "alive?\n",
      "A. He was not yet dead.  He was still breathing and then he would\n",
      "be carried onto the truck waiting outside the prison.  We could\n",
      "hear the sound of the truck coming in and out all day long.\n",
      "Q. I think you should have known about this, about the trucks\n",
      "that came and take people away all night.  Can you tell us\n",
      "whether the trucks only came during the night or during the\n",
      "daytime, or detainees would be taken by the trucks at any time\n",
      "from S-21?  I mean, those people who would be taken away and\n",
      "would never return.\n",
      "A. I was in the common cell or common room.  After being\n",
      "interrogated, I was put in the cell and I could hear the sound of\n",
      "the trucks.  I never saw the trucks; just heard the sound, the\n",
      "noise.  I did not know or see the detainees.  I only saw him once\n",
      "when I was painting the portrait of Pol Pot while they were\n",
      "carrying him, passing me.\n",
      "Q. So was it at night or during the daytime?  I'm asking this\n",
      "because after hearing testimony we have received two different\n",
      "kinds of information, especially concerning the transportation of\n",
      "detainees to Choeung Ek, because the information we obtained so\n",
      "far is that detainees would only be sent during the night.\n",
      "Another thing is that I don't know whether you're confused among\n",
      "two of you.  One witness who testified said that during the time\n",
      "he was detained at the location from the morning until 12 p.m. he\n",
      "would not be able to sleep because he wait until 12 p.m. passed\n",
      "so that he knew that no people would be carried away to be killed\n",
      "after that.  So that's why I would like you to clarify whether\n",
      "prisoners would be taken at night or in the daytime, especially\n",
      "regarding the person who was very sick and would be carried away\n",
      "by two people with a stick.  Was it done during the day or at\n",
      "night?\n",
      "A. At that time I did not see at night, of course, but I saw it\n",
      "during the daytime.  It was about 9 or 10 a.m.; I think more or\n",
      "less at about nine, between 9 and 10 a.m.\n",
      "Q. Normally when the trucks came, were the trucks driven to\n",
      "Building E or just they were parked right in front of the\n",
      "entrance; close to Building B or C, for example?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, regarding the trucks that transported the\n",
      "detainees, the truck parked outside under the gate -- I mean near\n",
      "that gate.  The truck did not come into the compound of the\n",
      "prison.  They parked outside.\n",
      "Q. Did you notice other activities of the staff at S-21 towards\n",
      "other detainees?\n",
      "A. When I was painting at Tuol Sleng, I saw female detainees.\n",
      "Some pregnant detainees would be walked away while being kicked\n",
      "by the guards -- female guards.  And they asked them to walk\n",
      "faster and they walked past Building B and then -- I mean from\n",
      "south to north, from Building A to B.  I did not know where they\n",
      "would be detained, but they passed us while we were painting the\n",
      "portraits.\n",
      "Q. The last question.  When you left with Uncle Nath and other\n",
      "survivors from S-21 on the 7th of January 1979, did you notice\n",
      "that in the buildings of S-21 there were some prisoners left?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I think it is more about freedom of the\n",
      "prisoners.  Prisoners were deprived of their liberty and we would\n",
      "not be allowed to move, so people -- I think there was quiet\n",
      "inside.\n",
      "Q. My question is this.  I mean the last day, the last day when\n",
      "you left S-21, because there were dead bodies on the beds.  There\n",
      "were 14 of them.  Some witnesses would say that there were only\n",
      "10; the accused said that there were only four people; and now\n",
      "the survivors, including you yourself, have noticed that there\n",
      "would be some kind of noise and could see people were still left\n",

      "because you agreed to confess and it was a false confession, was\n",
      "it based on the purpose in order to satisfy the interrogators, or\n",
      "you survived because of your skill as a painter?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, regarding the torture inflicted upon me --\n",
      "after they still couldn't extract the confession from me because\n",
      "I gave the same response every day, and because I did not know\n",
      "who was the leader or who introduced me into the CIA or KGB, they\n",
      "kept beating me up every day.\n",
      "And because they could not get my confession, they took me to the\n",
      "building which is now where you can purchase the ticket to visit\n",
      "the museum.  I was asked to sit there and they wrote a false\n",
      "confession and ordered me to sign.  I can not recall the content\n",
      "of that confession, it's been so many years now, and also because\n",
      "of the serious torture inflicted upon me my memory was not good.\n",
      "And at that time, if my memory was like I am now, I would not be\n",

      "stated, what happened during the times that you did the painting?\n",
      "For instance, were you detained again as a prisoner?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, no.  During the times that I did the painting I\n",
      "worked every day regularly so it took me a long time to complete\n",

      "physically or emotionally, did it happen elsewhere?\n",

      "Thank you, Mr. President.\n",
      "BY JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:\n",
      "Q. Mr. Bou Meng, you were at S-21 for a very long time and you\n",
      "have described your suffering and your experiences there; thank\n",
      "you for that.  But I have just one or two small questions to ask\n",
      "you.\n",
      "I want to know something about other prisoners whom you might\n",
      "have seen at S-21.  You have talked about the people who were in\n",
      "the same room shackled as you were.  You have spoken of seeing\n",
      "some pregnant women being kicked by female guards and told to\n",
      "walk more quickly.\n",
      "Did you see any foreigners at S-21, other than the large number\n",
      "of Vietnamese soldiers that you have described?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, the inmates in the common room where I was\n",
      "detained, there were some foreigners.  I was not sure of their\n",
      "nationality, whether they were European, American or Australian.\n",
      "They were detained in the same common room as I was detained, and\n",
      "they had the same food ration as I received.\n",
      "Q. Were you aware of any foreigners other than westerners or\n",
      "Vietnamese, such as Thais, people from Thailand?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, I did not see any Thai citizens.  I only saw\n",
      "Vietnamese people and some foreigners.  They were tall, they had\n",
      "bright eyes, and sort of bronze hair.  Besides that I did not see\n",
      "any other nationality, including Thai.\n",
      "Q. In addition to the Vietnamese soldiers, whom you saw, did you\n",
      "see any ordinary Vietnamese people; that is people who were not\n",
      "soldiers?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, yes, I saw civilian people.  They were not\n",
      "soldiers.  And I saw these one civilian, as I said earlier, he\n",
      "said he knew he was a real artist, but when Duch ordered him to\n",
      "test, to make the mould and he couldn't do it, and, of course, at\n",
      "that time Angkar was not happy -- was not happy of anybody lying\n",
      "to Angkar.  And I don't have anything else to say regarding this\n",
      "question.\n",
      "Q. The people whom you think might have been westerners, and the\n",
      "ordinary Vietnamese people whom you saw, were they all treated\n",
      "the same way as you were?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, for the prisoners the treatment was not the same.\n",
      "For example, I, myself, I received very serious torture, so only\n",
      "I, myself, knew clearly about what happened to me, and I cannot\n",
      "say about what happened to other inmates.\n",
      "Q. Did you see many children at S-21?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, for children at S-21, I did not see any of them\n",
      "walking around or detained there.  I only saw those children in\n",
      "the photos, but I did not see them personally during the time of\n",
      "my detention.  This is my frank and honest response.\n",
      "Q. Did you ever hear the sounds of children around S-21?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, for the sound of children, I did not hear.  I\n",
      "only heard the screaming, asking for help of the adult people\n",
      "while I was in the common room.  And while I was in the\n",
      "individual room, individual cell, I also heard the screaming, but\n",
      "the screaming of the adult, not the children.\n",
      "JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:\n",
      "Thank you very much, Mr. Bou Meng.\n",
      "Mr. President, I have no further questions.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Judges of the Bench, do you have any questions?\n",
      "Judge Lavergne, you take the floor.\n",
      "BY JUDGE LAVERGNE:\n",
      "Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Bou Meng.\n",
      "I also have a few questions to ask you, to try to clarify what\n",
      "you already explained in detail to the Chamber earlier on today.\n",
      "I think I understood through what you said this morning, and\n",
      "through what I have read in your testimony, that your life was\n",
      "essentially impacted by many sacrifices, and by a life of\n",
      "obedience.  And you said this morning that you answered Prince\n",
      "Sihanouk's call in 1970 to free Cambodia, to liberate Cambodia.\n",
      "Is that so?\n",
      "A. At that time, I heard the appeal of the Prince Sihanouk on the\n",
      "radio broadcast.  I was not sure which broadcast was it.  He\n",
      "appealed for his children to go to the maquis forest to struggle,\n",
      "so I decided to enter the maquis forest in 1971 with another\n",
      "friend from K25 office.\n",
      "So we went to the maquis forest to make some sketches and drawing\n",
      "of Marx and Lenin.  I was the one who drew the pictures of Marx\n",
      "and Lenin.  And those sketches were stencilled and distributed to\n",
      "various units in order to understand the supreme leaders of the\n",
      "Communists -- of the Communist country.  There were five of them\n",
      "all together: Karl Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mao Zhedong.  So I even\n",
      "drew the sketches of these people on the cloth.\n",
      "Q. So you worked there for the -- at the services of the\n",
      "Communist Party of Kampuchea's propaganda.  You were very\n",
      "respectful of what you were requested to do.  And then between\n",
      "the end of your activity with the propaganda services and your\n",
      "job at the Orussei Technical School, did you do anything else\n",
      "between; was there another episode in your career?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, let me correct that.  It was called the Russei\n",
      "Keo Technical School, not Orussei Technical School.\n",
      "Q. Did you go directly from the propaganda services to the Russei\n",
      "Keo Technical School or did you do anything in between?\n",
      "A. In between that time -- in order to make it easier to\n",
      "understand, let me go back. First, I worked for the Ministry of\n",
      "Commerce, of State Commerce,  and Koy Thuon was the Prime\n",
      "Minister at the time.  I was requested to draw placards for a\n",
      "boat.  It was called Marinal Transport.  And I made some other\n",
      "placards and signs and boards for those boats and vehicles while\n",
      "I was there.\n",
      "Q. Well, back then did you trust the CPK entirely?  Were you\n",
      "somebody who was very much obedient, who would follow what you\n",
      "were being told to do?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, that was my specialty, the skills that I had.  I\n",
      "knew that the evacuation of people from Phnom Penh disappointed\n",
      "me because I struggled, I was so sick with malaria, and in the\n",
      "end I received such a suffering which is indescribable.  I felt\n",
      "so regretful for such inhumane acts of leadership which did not\n",
      "satisfy my willing -- my understanding.  I physically served them\n",
      "but emotionally I did not, although I wore black shirt, but my\n",
      "mind was not black.  I did what I was instructed, based on my\n",
      "skill.\n",
      "This is my response, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. Was there a specific moment where you might have entirely lost\n",
      "trust in the CPK?  Was there any moment when you said to yourself\n",
      "that what you might have believed in did not correspond to\n",
      "reality?\n",
      "A. I don't really understand your question.  Can you rephrase\n",
      "your question again and please try to be simplified and make it\n",
      "short?\n",
      "Q. Well, can we say that when you were working for the Russei Keo\n",
      "School and when you worked previously for the propaganda\n",
      "services, that you trusted the CPK and Angkar?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, I carry out the task based on the assignment from\n",
      "my superior, including drawing the sketches of the machines or\n",
      "for the new parts of the machines.  Everything was done based on\n",
      "the instructions from the chairman of that technical school.\n",
      "This is my response, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. You explained that your superiors at the technical school had\n",
      "been arrested and that you yourself had been sent to be\n",
      "re-educated.  At that moment, was your trust in the CPK -- was it\n",
      "-- did it change or did you still have full trust in the CPK?\n",
      "A. At that time, Your Honour, I lost my trust because my\n",
      "performance in carrying out the assignment was excellent, I did\n",
      "what I was asked, but I could not understand why I was\n",
      "transferred to be re-educated at the Ta Lei Co-operative.  I was\n",
      "disappointed and this is my frank response to you.  I no longer\n",
      "had my trust.\n",
      "Q. But, however, despite the difficult conditions in which you\n",
      "were, you continued obeying and you continued following the\n",
      "orders that were given to you.  Is that why it was particularly\n",
      "difficult for you to understand why you had been arrested by\n",
      "security cadres of the CPK?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, at that time, I myself and some other people\n",
      "totalling about 10, were transferred from the Russei Keo\n",
      "Technical School to Ta Lei Co-operative and I did not know the\n",
      "reason for the transfer.\n",
      "However, before the transfer we were instructed to make our\n",
      "biography, as I can recall, so I made my biography to the Angkar\n",
      "and about one or two months later I was transferred to the Ta Lei\n",
      "Co-operative amongst about 10 other people, including my wife.\n",
      "So we were tempered to do hard labour at the Ta Lei Co-operative.\n",
      "I did not know the reason for the transfer, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. Back then, had you heard of the security centres?  Were you\n",
      "aware, for example, of the existence of S-21 or of other security\n",
      "centres?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, regarding the security offices or the prisons, I\n",
      "did not hear anything at all during the time, however, people\n",
      "kept disappearing.  Some probably were sent for re-education or\n",
      "sent for training here and there.\n",
      "I had heard a lot about transferring of people or relocation of\n",
      "people starting from 1976, and I was wondering how come, while\n",
      "people were still working good and they were transferred\n",
      "elsewhere?  Or whether they had any plan of transforming in the\n",
      "agriculture production?  I only had doubt in my mind, however, I\n",
      "just kept doing what I was given or instructed.\n",
      "So I typed some documents that I was asked to do and I drew\n",
      "sketches for the students to study.  I could not understand their\n",
      "thinking.  They were in a higher class and I thought I belonged\n",
      "to the lower class with limited technical capability.\n",
      "Q. Can we say that you were not at all aware of having committed\n",
      "any kind of offence that you absolutely were not aware having\n",
      "betrayed the CPK, that you had absolutely no awareness of being\n",
      "part of a group of traitors?\n",
      "A. When I came I knew that there was a Minister of Propaganda,\n",
      "Mr. Ho Nim, who\n",
      "called me to draw a portrait of the embarkment structure.  And at\n",
      "that time the current king was teaching students how to perform\n",
      "the ballet dancing and then he told me to help draw a portrait of\n",
      "his father.  And he called his father the normal, ordinary\n",
      "person's language and I was surprised but I did not ask further\n",
      "questions.\n",
      "Probably they saw the picture, the photo that the king asked me\n",
      "to draw; that's why they arrested me, or not.  I'm not quite\n",
      "sure.\n",
      "Q. This morning, you also talked, at length, about the\n",
      "ill-treatment that was inflicted upon you.  You also talked about\n",
      "the physiological consequences thereof.  You also said to us that\n",
      "you still had scars.  I seem to have understood that these\n",
      "tortures led to other consequences, such as problems with your\n",
      "hearing.  Do you have other physiological conditions or\n",
      "difficulties that you may ascribe to being the consequences of\n",
      "that ill-treatment?\n",
      "A. I was slapped and I was beaten on the head; all kinds of\n",
      "tortures had been inflicted on me.  So in short, I believe that\n",
      "because I was severely tortured, that I look older than my age\n",
      "and I lose all the teeth, and I can observe that Brother Chum Mey\n",
      "still have his teeth.  And also I have had problems with hearing\n",
      "and I think this is probably the consequence of the torture.  And\n",
      "I look much older than I am and if you compare to the age, I\n",
      "think I should have not been that old if I was not tortured.\n",
      "Q. From what you can remember, do you have the feeling that the\n",
      "people interrogating you were enjoying themselves by making you\n",
      "suffer or seeing you suffer?\n",
      "A. During the time when I was being interrogated some people ate\n",
      "the jackfruit and they threw the remaining -- the peel of the\n",
      "jackfruit onto my head and I could feel like then I was perceived\n",
      "as enemy and prisoner.  I could not do anything but to let them\n",
      "do whatever they wish and they did not show any mercy towards me\n",
      "as a human being.  And whenever I recall it, I cannot hold back\n",
      "my tears.  I was so disappointed that I had devoted myself for\n",
      "the work and after all I end up being tortured.  I wished I were\n",
      "killed by the malaria in the jungle, but I think my life was\n",
      "valuable that I could survive longer to be tortured again.\n",
      "That's all, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. When you were a painter at the workshop, do you now remember\n",
      "having been taken out of the workshop in relation to an incident?\n",
      "You were taken away from the workshop for about two weeks; do you\n",
      "remember that?  Do you remember then coming back to the workshop,\n",
      "having to say you were sorry, seek forgiveness?  Do you remember\n",
      "having been kicked?  Do you remember this episode or something\n",
      "like this, or do you not remember something like this happening\n",
      "to you?\n",
      "A. I think, through my recollection, this incident might not have\n",
      "happened.  I knew that one of my neighbours in my next room was\n",
      "taken away -- no, the guy who worked next to my school -- the\n",
      "technical school of Russei Keo.  A couple were taken or arrested.\n",
      "I don't know whether two of them or one of them was arrested but\n",
      "they both disappeared.  Then it came my turn who were transferred\n",
      "to Ta Lei Co-operative and that's what I have seen and known and\n",
      "I think my memory is not that good.  Maybe I have not fully\n",
      "recollected all the episodes, and accept my apologies for not\n",
      "being able to recall everything.  That's all.\n",
      "Q. Mr. Bou Meng, sorry, I was referring to the period when you\n",
      "were working in the workshop at S-21.  You were at the workshop\n",
      "in S-21.  During that period when you were working at S-21\n",
      "workshop, where you were working with Vann Nath and other\n",
      "artists; during that period, was there an episode the result of\n",
      "which was that you had to go and say sorry; that you had to go\n",
      "and apologize?\n",
      "A. I don't know whether the apologies were made to my colleagues\n",
      "or to the guards.  I'm not quite sure I understand the question.\n",
      "Q. Were you forced to apologize to your colleagues in the\n",
      "workshop at S-21 or to other people?  Were you, one day, shackled\n",
      "or tied up and led to go and offer apologies to either your\n",
      "colleagues or somebody else in the workshop?\n",
      "A. I cannot recall or maybe I forgot, because I never offered my\n",
      "apologies to anyone, even to my colleagues.  It is based on my\n",
      "recollection but of course I would have forgotten.  As the Khmer\n",
      "proverb says, \"The elephants with four legs would have collapsed\n",
      "sometime and the wise person would forget anyway.\"\n",
      "Q. Thank you, Mr. Bou Meng, for these responses.  I have one very\n",
      "last question for you.\n",
      "This morning you told us that the accused had talked about\n",
      "fertilizer, saying that humans could be fertilizer in the paddy\n",
      "fields.  Could you explain to us the meaning of this term,\n",
      "please?\n",
      "A.  The statement is based on the accused Kaing Guek Eav, alias\n",
      "Duch.  He said that if I could not resemble the portrait of Pol\n",
      "Pot then I would be used as the human fertilizer.\n",
      "And I didn't understand whether I would be used to produce\n",
      "fertilizer or would I be used as the fertilizer myself for the\n",
      "rice field.  That's what he asked me and I found it difficult to\n",
      "respond to him also at that moment.\n",
      "Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Bou Meng.\n",
      "JUDGE LAVERGNE:\n",
      "I have no further questions, Mr. President.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Next we would like to give the opportunity to the prosecutors to\n",
      "put questions to Uncle Bou Meng, the survivor of S-21.\n",

      "QUESTIONING BY THE CO-PROSECUTORS\n",
      "BY MR. SENG BUNKHEANG:\n",
      "Q. Good afternoon, Uncle Bou Meng.\n",
      "I have a few questions to be put to you.  Regarding the food\n",
      "ration, was it enough?\n",
      "A. The food ration, during the time when I was detained, was\n",
      "inadequate.  But when people were looking for someone who could\n",
      "paint and when I came out to work as the painter with Vann Nath,\n",
      "with Kong, with Pha Tha Chan and Bech, the food was adequate.\n",
      "But it was inadequate when I was still in the prison.\n",
      "And there would be other documents to support my arguments about\n",
      "this condition.  You may refer to it.  Thank you.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "When you were being detained at S-21 in the common room and in\n",

      "BY MR. KONG PISEY:\n",
      "Q. Good afternoon, Uncle Bou Meng.  My first question is the\n",
      "follow-up question concerning the earlobes, your earlobes.  You\n",
      "said that you received tortures onto the earlobes -- no, the ears\n",
      "as a whole, and you said you had a hearing problem.\n",
      "I would like to ask whether now you can listen to people and your\n",
      "ears are okay, or you need a hearing aid to assist you with the\n",
      "hearing?\n",
      "A. The Court officials have helped me and taken me to the\n",
      "hospital specializing in hearing and then they offered me a\n",
      "hearing aid.  I now can hear better.  If I use my bare ears to\n",
      "listen to people talking I would not be able to listen or to\n",
      "understand their conversation unless I paid very close attention,\n",
      "or move very close to them.  So if I could put number one to 10,\n",
      "I could hear about 30 percent.  I mean three out of 10 because of\n",
      "my impairment.  And I think my eyesight were not good.  My teeth,\n",
      "also, are not good.\n",
      "Of course, when people get old, this kind of thing will get old\n",
      "as well, but you know, like, Chum Mey is still young, and I am\n",
      "older than my age because I had been tortured, otherwise I would\n",
      "be ok now.  And my ears would have not been that bad.  So here --\n",
      "I can sit here, I cannot even listen to you if you talked over\n",
      "there.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  My next question.\n",
      "I want to know about your suffering.  How long had you endured\n",
      "this suffering or you still feel the suffering at the present\n",
      "time?\n",
      "A. Are you talking about the suffering, the physical suffering,\n",
      "in addition to the emotional suffering?\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  I meant regarding your earache.  So you suffered\n",
      "when they tortured you.  Are your ears in a better condition now?\n",
      "A. They are fully recovered, however, I have had hard hearing.\n",
      "So that's why I need the hearing aid so that I could hear\n",
      "properly.  Without the hearing aid, I could hardly hear anything.\n",
      "That's all.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  Regarding the electrocution, as you stated that\n",
      "they used the wall power outlet to electrocute you.  You said you\n",
      "were electrocuted near your genitals.  How far was the spot where\n",
      "it was electrocuted?\n",
      "A. It was to the inner side of my thigh.  So once I was\n",
      "electrocuted, I fell unconscious immediately, and when I gained\n",
      "my consciousness, the water was everywhere on my face.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  Did they place the wire on your pants or on your\n",
      "flesh directly?\n",
      "A.  It was placed on my shorts, however, there was a machine that\n",
      "I think it controlled the voltage, and that machine hooked into\n",
      "the power outlet from the wall.  So I think they could increase\n",
      "the voltage from that machine.\n",
      "But you could easily understand that if the voltage was not\n",
      "strong enough, then I would not fall unconscious.  That's it.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  You already informed the Chamber that once you\n",
      "were electrocuted, you fell unconscious straight away.  And for\n",
      "how long did you become unconscious?\n",
      "A. If you are unconscious, it's like you were sleeping.  You\n",
      "would not know how long you fell unconscious.\n",
      "Q. On another matter, did you go and make consultation with the\n",
      "psychological support?\n",
      "A. Previously, I have had consultation with a psychological\n",
      "support.  I was assisted with some tablets so that I would not\n",
      "have insomnia, and I take two types of tablets on a daily basis.\n",
      "But when I come to the Court and speak in this current condition,\n",
      "I can't not even eat my lunch today because I was overwhelmed and\n",
      "I did not feel like eating anything.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  Now, on the matter of interrogation, you stated to\n",
      "the Chamber that there were five interrogators: Hor, Chan, Tith,\n",
      "Peng and Kuy, but you haven't clearly verified that for each\n",
      "interrogation, were the five present and beating you up or were\n",
      "you interrogated and tortured by only one interrogator at a time?\n",
      "A.   They were there during the interrogation, but only one\n",
      "person beat me at a time and then they took turns.  First Chan\n",
      "beat me up.  He asked me to count the number of lashes.  When I\n",
      "counted up to 10 I told him, and he said, \"It's not yet 10, I\n",
      "only hit you once\".  And I can remember his word.  I remember his\n",
      "words, I remember his face.\n",
      "I can always remember his face, the person who mistreated me.  I\n",
      "remember both, those who did good thing and who did bad things to\n",
      "me.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  The question is, on one day during the\n",
      "interrogation, were the five interrogators beat you up on that\n",
      "same day or only they came on another day?\n",
      "A. That group of interrogators, the five of them, they took turns\n",
      "to beat me up until all the five became exhausted or when the\n",
      "time was up.  For example, from 7 a.m. until about 11 or 12, then\n",
      "they rested.  I saw all of them.\n",
      "Q. So from what I can understand, you confirmed that in -- for\n",
      "each date, the five of them present at the same time.  Is that\n",
      "true?\n",
      "A. That is correct.\n",
      "Q. My next question.  You stated to the Chamber that when they\n",
      "water-hosed you in the common room, so all the inmates had to\n",
      "take off their clothes, and later on they had to dry the floor\n",
      "with their shorts.\n",
      "The question is, did the guards order the prisoners to take off\n",
      "their shorts or the prisoners took off their shorts by\n",
      "themselves?\n",
      "A. I am not sure on this point.  My memory is not clear.  I can\n",
      "remember that all of us, 30 or 40 of us, were all naked, and I\n",
      "even remember one phrase.  The person was about 15 or 16 years\n",
      "old.  He said, \"You, you have a small build but with big\n",
      "genital\".  That's what he said.  \"And this guy, you're big, but\n",
      "your penis is tiny\".  That's what he said.  So they just make a\n",
      "joke out of us being naked.  And I still can remember what was\n",
      "said, but I can not say for sure whether we took off the pants by\n",
      "ourselves or they ordered us to take the pants off.  I'm not sure\n",
      "because probably they ordered us to take the pants off so they\n",
      "can joke about our genitals.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "So for every time you were water-hosed, were all of you had to be\n",
      "naked?\n",
      "A. Yes, we all had to be naked.  I looked around.  Nobody had\n",
      "underwear or pants on them.  People were like animals from hell,\n",
      "all naked.  Because they treated us as enemies, as traitors, they\n",
      "water-hosed us from outside so the water was everywhere in the\n",
      "common room.  So then we tried to dry the floor with our pants\n",
      "until the floor was completely dry.  Then we could lie down on\n",
      "the floor again.\n",
      "And we all of us had skin rashes and a lot of skin lice.  It was\n",
      "so itchy everywhere.  I think it was Nhem En (phonetic) who\n",
      "wanted to find a cure, a treatment for skin rash and itch, and\n",
      "after that it was better.  Let me say, only the guards who could\n",
      "able to find that traditional medicines to help us with the\n",
      "itches and the skin rash.\n",
      "Q. So when you were water-hosed, were you provided any soap?\n",
      "A. No, there was no soap or nothing to scrub our body.  We were\n",
      "washed like pigs were washed.  Because I used to raise pigs, when\n",
      "I washed my pigs, then I water-hosed my pigs and I used my hands\n",
      "to clean my pigs.  But I was even lower than my pigs or my dog\n",
      "because no soap was used, no scarf was used to change or dry my\n",
      "body.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "Regarding the common room, did you ever see the prisoners who\n",
      "were taken out and when they returned, did you see any wound or\n",
      "marks on their bodies?\n",
      "A. It seems that I did not see such incidents.  I was not sure.\n",
      "Because maybe they were in the same way like I was there, it\n",
      "means after the interrogation and the torture, they would be\n",
      "taken to the individual cells so that those in the common room\n",
      "would not know that we were being tortured.\n",

      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "And what about the names of the guards; do you know their names?\n",
      "A. I only remember the names of the interrogators.  I could not\n",
      "recall the names of the guards.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "My last question:  at that time, you heard the sound of the\n",
      "trucks coming in and going out, taking the prisoners in and out,\n",
      "day and night.  When you heard the sound of the vehicles, was it\n",
      "from the east or from the west entrance?  Please can you try to\n",
      "recall?  It's okay if you cannot remember.\n",
      "A. From my recollection, although I must admit I am forgetful, it\n",
      "was common for the vehicle coming in and going out.  However I\n",
      "did not know when the car going out -- I'm not sure where it went\n",
      "to, I only heard the sound.  And at that time I was a prisoner\n",
      "being detained in the individual cell, and the car sound coming\n",
      "from the front of the Tuol Sleng prison.\n",
      "Q. Now, previously I thought that this is my last question, but\n",
      "now I have another question based on the request from my\n",
      "colleague.\n",
      "You said you heard the screaming of the victims -- that is the\n",
      "screaming of the prisoners at S-21.  When you heard such\n",
      "screaming, was the accused, the prison chief, was there with you?\n",
      "A. While I was sleeping in Building C on the third floor in the\n",
      "common room, at night I heard the screaming.  I think probably\n",
      "the screaming was a result of the person being interrogated and\n",
      "tortured.\n",
      "To me it seems the screaming was echoing and coming from\n",
      "everywhere at the surrounding vicinity of Tuol Sleng prison,\n",
      "probably because during that time those houses around Tuol Sleng\n",
      "were used as the interrogation houses.\n",
      "But now all those houses are gone, even the house where I was\n",
      "interrogated behind Building A outside the compound also\n",
      "disappears now.  I could not recognize it any more.  That's all.\n",
      "MS. TY SRINNA:\n",
      "I have no more questions for you and thank you for answering the\n",
      "questions.\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Now the floor is given to the next civil party lawyer.  You take\n",
      "the floor.\n",
      "MS. JACQUIN:\n",
      "Good afternoon, Your Honours.\n",
      "BY MS. JACQUIN:\n",
      "Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Bou Meng.  These are my questions to you.\n",
      "First of all, you stated that in the common room there were\n",
      "foreign prisoners or people who looked foreign, westerners.  Were\n",
      "they taken away while you were still in that room or were they\n",
      "still in that room at the time when you were taken away from that\n",
      "room?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, when I saw them they were westerners or we say\n",
      "Europeans.  They had light complexion and blond hair.  Of course\n",
      "I did not know their nationality.  I saw them for only a short\n",
      "period of time and then they disappeared.  They were there for\n",
      "probably two weeks being detained on that floor of Building C.\n",
      "So after about two weeks they disappeared and I didn't know where\n",
      "they were taken to.  That's all.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "You stated that you saw Vietnamese soldiers in uniform;\n",
      "consequently, you were quite sure that they were indeed\n",
      "Vietnamese soldiers, beyond doubt.\n",
      "A. Let me tell you, Ms. Lawyer, those Vietnamese soldiers,\n",
      "because they wore a different uniform, military uniform,\n",
      "different from the Khmer Rouge military uniforms, that uniform\n",
      "was similar to the Chinese soldier uniform.  They had a khaki\n",
      "colour and they had their rank displayed and they wore the type\n",
      "of helmet.  That's what led to my conclusion.  That's all.\n",
      "Q. I'm asking this question because there seems to be something\n",
      "ambiguous in your response unless I have misunderstood.\n",
      "Would these Vietnamese soldiers have been soldiers who retained\n",
      "their uniforms, or were these Vietnamese soldiers partners of the\n",
      "Khmer Rouge as guards and organizers of the prison?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, it is my personal view that they were real\n",
      "soldiers, they were not fake.  So it was the real military\n",
      "uniform, although some uniforms were rather old.  That is all.\n",
      "Q. So you confirm that those soldiers did not have a status of\n",
      "prisoners?\n",
      "A. I was wondering, for example, like when Kaing Guek Eav, alias\n",
      "Duch, said when you were sent there you would be treated as the\n",
      "enemy regardless you were civilians or soldiers, you were all\n",
      "regarded as the enemy.\n",
      "Q. Furthermore, you have stated that you saw a number of guards\n",
      "who were 15 or 16 years old.  They were mere teenagers.  Have you\n",
      "seen guards who were younger than that still, who would have\n",
      "been, let's say, 10 or 12 years old?\n",
      "A. I did not see any guards who were 15 or under, unless I was\n",
      "mistaken.  Usually they were 15 or above.  That was through my\n",
      "observation at the time.  That's all.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  And I have two personal questions for you now.\n",
      "Do you feel bad about having signed the confession that you had\n",
      "to sign because of duress, whereas you knew that this confession,\n",
      "the content of it, was false?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, at that time my emotion was mixed.  I was fearful,\n",
      "worried; I could not describe the emotion.  So I just did what I\n",
      "was ordered to do because there was absolutely no reason for them\n",
      "to suspect me to be a CIA or KGB agent, and I was tortured\n",
      "enough.\n",
      "Some prisoners, when they were tortured and interrogated, they\n",
      "confessed and finally they were taken and smashed, but for me I\n",
      "was different.  Of course physically I signed the confession but\n",
      "inside my heart I of course did not approve the confession.\n",
      "Q. I'm sure nobody would challenge that, sir.\n",
      "Another question.  Within the workshop amongst the sculptors,\n",
      "painters, artists would you amongst yourselves talk at all about\n",
      "the tortures that you had been subjected to and the confessions\n",
      "that you were forced to sign?  Did you talk about these things\n",
      "amongst yourselves within the workshop?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, I never talked about that.  The reason is because\n",
      "I was scared.  Usually there were two or three prison guards who\n",
      "were there constantly and the door was locked both inside and\n",
      "outside, so if we whispered or chit-chatted on this thing then\n",
      "it's so risky.\n",
      "Q. One last question.  Today how do you feel about the fact that\n",
      "you are a survivor?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, I am so delighted that now my chest seems to be\n",
      "lighter.  All my statements to the Judges and to the lawyers and\n",
      "the rest, I felt much better now and I believed through peace and\n",
      "justice would be done for those 1.8 or two million people who\n",
      "lost their lives during that regime, and I myself too, I was a\n",
      "victim and the scope of suffering was incalculable.  I was almost\n",
      "killed.  My back was wounded severely and still I could carry out\n",
      "my profession, painting the portraits to satisfy the chief of the\n",
      "prison.\n",
      "But it was shameful that I could not save the life of my wife.\n",
      "I'm not sure if it was my mistake or not and I really want to ask\n",
      "the accused where was my wife killed.  If I know where it is then\n",
      "I would go there in order to pray for her soul, and that I am now\n",
      "being testified before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Court of\n",
      "Cambodia, only the spirit of the earth would know where the soul\n",
      "has gone to or where the dead bodies were buried.  So only the\n",
      "spirits of the wind, of the water, of the earth would know.\n",
      "And for those who killed the people, they could tell the truth or\n",
      "they could lie, but only the spirits of the earth, the wind and\n",
      "the water know where my wife died, so that I could pray for her\n",
      "soul.  That is all.\n",
      "MS. JACQUIN:\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. Bou Meng.\n",
      "Mr. President, on behalf of all the civil party groups, we have a\n",
      "request to put to you.  We would like to ask for 10 extra\n",
      "minutes.  There are seven lawyers present here representing 90\n",
      "victims.  All of these victims are important.  If we are to share\n",
      "out this time it would amount to one half-minute per victim, but\n",
      "we have legitimate questions to put.\n",
      "Sir, you have been showing tolerance in interpreting the time\n",
      "allowance and we are grateful for this.  However, we have all\n",
      "sorts of time management problems.  If you could assure us that\n",
      "we have could have, if need be, an extra 10 minutes, this would\n",
      "make it possible for us to work amongst ourselves more\n",
      "harmoniously.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "MS. CANIZARES:\n",
      "Mr. President, if extra time were to be granted to the\n",
      "representatives of the civil parties would it be possible to have\n",
      "extra time, if necessary, for the defence to ask questions?\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "In order not to complicate the matter regarding the request by\n",
      "both sides and the civil party lawyers use the time as allocated\n",
      "by the Chamber, however, the Chamber will not allow extra time\n",
      "and the time has run out already.\n",
      "Now I would give the opportunity to the survivor, Bou Meng.\n",
      "Uncle Bou Meng, do you have any questions that you would like to\n",
      "ask the accused at the moment?\n",
      "MR. BOU MENG:\n",
      "Mr. President, I would like to ask him where did he smash my\n",
      "wife; whether it was at Tuol Sleng or Choeung Ek or at another\n",
      "location.\n",
      "Did you have the authority to relocate her or to smash her?  It\n",
      "has been so many years already.  I went to her native village in\n",
      "Tboung Khmum district in Kampong Cham province.   I went to ask\n",
      "her elder sibling whether my wife has ever returned to the\n",
      "village and the response was no.  So I presumed that she was\n",
      "killed while she was detained.\n",
      "And my question is just to tell me, just to tell me where she was\n",
      "killed or smashed.  Then I would go to that location and just to\n",
      "get the soil from that location to pray for her soul because\n",
      "there was not her document at the S-21 Office.  I used to have\n",
      "some documents as well, but some of the documents I have I have\n",
      "lost or are missing.  And I want the matter to be done legally.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Can you verify that your wife, who was detained at S-21 with you,\n",
      "her name was Ma Yoeun alias Thy.  Is that correct?\n",
      "MR. BOU MENG:\n",
      "That is correct, Mr. President.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Mr. Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, the first question is, do you\n",
      "know Ma Yoeun alias Thy?  If you know her, could you answer to\n",
      "his question that when you were the chairman of S-21 and that his\n",
      "wife was taken away to be executed, where was she killed?  In\n",
      "Phnom Penh or at Choeung Ek?\n",
      "THE ACCUSED:\n",
      "Mr. President, thank you, Mr. President for giving me the\n",
      "opportunity to respond to the question.\n",
      "Mr. Meng, especially for you I have been moved.  We have lived\n",
      "together and you were healthy and I was shocked to see you on the\n",
      "28th of February 2008 before the Co-Investigating Judges.  I\n",
      "would like to respond to your desire, but it was beyond my\n",
      "capacity because this work done by my subordinates, but I would\n",
      "like to presume that your wife might have been killed at Boeng\n",
      "Choeung Ek.\n",
      "Meanwhile, to be sure, I would like to ask you to please ask\n",
      "Comrade Huy who may be able to tell you further detail about the\n",
      "fate of your wife.  Please accept my highest assurance of my\n",
      "regards and respects towards the soul of your wife.  That's all.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "The accused, please control your emotion and re-compose because\n",
      "the moment is important that it takes time to listen to the\n",
      "testimony of the survivors who have survived the regime and to\n",
      "recall the past.\n",
      "So, Uncle Bou Meng, I hope you have already been told by the\n",
      "accused about the fate of your wife because his conclusion is\n",
      "that she could have been killed at Boeng Choeung Ek, especially\n",
      "when it comes to the time when she was sent in during the year of\n",
      "1977.\n",
      "At the beginning, the killing would take place only at the\n",
      "premises of Tuol Sleng compound and later on, after 1977 to '78,\n",
      "then the execution sites had been shifted to Choeung Ek.  So it\n",
      "could be possible that the fate of your wife would be ended there\n",
      "at Choeung Ek or she would be killed there.\n",
      "And to get further information, it is rather difficult because\n",
      "the people who perished amounted to more than 12,000, and those\n",
      "more than 12,000 were registered and there were still numbers of\n",
      "detainees who are still unaccounted for.  At the beginning, we\n",
      "know that there would have been 12,300 or something detainees,\n",
      "but after inspecting the list and compared with other lists, then\n",
      "we could see more numbers, different numbers of the people killed\n",
      "during that time.  But I think the actual number of people who\n",
      "would have been killed would be even higher if all documents\n",
      "could be supported.\n",
      "Next, the accused, besides your response to Uncle Bou Meng, one\n",
      "of the survivors who asked you about the fate of his wife, the\n",
      "Chamber would like to also know whether the accused would like to\n",
      "make any comments or observations, testimony, concerning the\n",
      "remarks or testimony of Uncle Bou Meng.  So you are now given the\n",
      "opportunity to do so if you would wish.\n",
      "THE ACCUSED:\n",
      "Mr. President, first, I would like to confirm to Mr. Bou Meng and\n",
      "the other victims.  He keep asking what kind of mistakes he had\n",
      "committed; what kind of mistake his wife committed that led to\n",
      "their arrest.\n",
      "Frankly, during that time, I already -- I think yesterday I told\n",
      "Brother Mey already -- anyone who opposed them would be singled\n",
      "out as the CIA, the KGB, or the expansionist, so on and so forth.\n",
      "So I would like just to repeat it and to be more precise.\n",
      "I would like to state that the Cultural Revolution of China would\n",
      "be seen as the reference.  Although Pol Pot did not follow\n",
      "exactly that kind of philosophy, he used his own improvised\n",
      "theory, so he would implicate anyone as an enemy.\n",
      "And I told Brother Mey already about the CIA.  He asked me\n",
      "whether CIA or KGB agents have already been smashed and I told\n",
      "him that anyone who opposes the Pol Pot were those who have\n",
      "defeated the Pol Pot regime.\n",
      "And, after all, the fascist political politics ended on January\n",
      "1979, so the reason why people were implicated or opponents, this\n",
      "lead to the destruction of the whole regime, and I would like to\n",
      "emphasize again that this crime is so severe, although it was\n",
      "committed by the upper echelon.  But members of the Party were\n",
      "part of the process all across the country, because more than one\n",
      "million people were executed, and emotionally I am responsible\n",
      "for all the crimes, although they were committed by the senior\n",
      "people.\n",
      "I am responsible in the eyes of the law, and I now would like to\n",
      "be tried by the ECCC alone, and I don't want my subordinates to\n",
      "be on trial too.  And I have already dedicated -- I have already\n",
      "prayed for the souls of the dead people to rest in peace.  I'm\n",
      "not talking here to evade the responsibility of my crimes but I\n",
      "want to reveal my frankness.  That's all.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Next we would like to give the floor to the defence counsel to\n",
      "have the opportunity to put questions to Uncle Bou Meng, one of\n",
      "the survivors of S-21.\n",
      "The floor is yours, if you would wish to do so.\n",
      "MR. KAR SAVUTH:\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President.  Your Honours, my questions here are\n",
      "first I would like Mr. Bou Meng to clarify on some points because\n",
      "I have been ambivalent regarding those points.\n",
      "QUESTIONING BY DEFENCE COUNSEL\n",
      "BY MR. KAR SAVUTH:\n",
      "Q. When you were detained at S-21 did you hear the cries, the\n",
      "weeps or screams of people in the compound?  Because this\n",
      "morning, before we adjourned for lunch, you said that there were\n",
      "full -- everyone was quiet and people could not even whisper to\n",
      "one another.  So I think your testimony in the morning seems to\n",
      "be contradictory to your testimony in the afternoon.  Could you\n",
      "please repeat or confirm your both testimonies?\n",
      "A. I said it was very quiet because the doors were all shut when\n",
      "I left, evacuated.  I did not have a chance to look inside the\n",
      "rooms because I were at -- I was walked away at gunpoint and I\n",
      "was not brave enough to even look back to see how many people\n",
      "would be in the room.  That's why I said it was quiet.\n",
      "And I think regarding the screams, the cries, I knew that my ears\n",
      "were too good to listen to those noises because I was also a very\n",
      "good artist.  Having heard the sound, I could even draft or\n",
      "sketch a kind of portrait, so I think I was not mistaken to hear\n",
      "those screams during the time when I was detained.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  Could you please emphasize again: you said that\n",
      "before the morning break, you said that the building was full of\n",
      "people.  And you said that the building was full of detainees but\n",
      "it was so quiet because people could not even whisper into the\n",
      "ears of the neighbours.  But how could you say that you heard the\n",
      "screams, the cries that people cried for help?  I don't want you\n",
      "to tell us about the time when you were about to leave S-21.\n",
      "A. I would like to state that when I was inside the detention\n",
      "centre, around the compound there were a lot of interrogating\n",
      "houses.  And inside the room, of course, you could not hear\n",
      "anyone scream or cry because we would be punished.  But I'm\n",
      "talking about the people who would be taken away to be\n",
      "interrogated inside those houses, and we could hear from the\n",
      "houses.  I'm not here to talk and to implicate anyone.  I'm\n",
      "talking here, right before the iron genie, and if I talked\n",
      "something, exaggerating anything, then I would be run over by a\n",
      "bus.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  I would like you to only confirm.  Number two, I\n",
      "would like your confirmation also.  You said the subordinates of\n",
      "Duch, who treated the Vietnamese prisoner who did not keep his\n",
      "promise that he was a sculptor, and that you said Duch ordered\n",
      "his subordinate to kick or to torture him but later on you said\n",
      "that Duch was not there when his subordinates tortured him.  So\n",
      "could you please tell us whether Duch was there when the torture\n",
      "took place?\n",
      "A. Mr. Lawyer, I said, my memory is not good.  And I said clearly\n",
      "that it is because I have had been severely tortured, and I don't\n",
      "want to evade any responses but if I made any mistake in my\n",
      "testimony it is resulted from the very poor memory of mine;\n",
      "resulted, of course, from such torture.  So I think my memory is\n",
      "now about\n",
      "to 20 percent good, compared to the 100 percent I           10   could have had previously.\n",
      "BY MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. Uncle Meng, could you please control your emotion?  I know\n",
      "that you have been bombarded with questions, and you have been\n",
      "answering to those questions for almost the whole day already.\n",
      "We would like you to please recompose yourself.\n",
      "And the question is implied as, have you heard that Duch ordered\n",
      "his subordinates to beat the Vietnamese detainee?  And some said\n",
      "that he was the Khmer Krom national who pretended to be a good\n",
      "sculptor.  So the question is whether Duch did order such torture\n",
      "or punishment to be inflicted on that person, or Duch\n",
      "subordinates initiated such ideas of punishment spontaneously,\n",
      "because there was a torture inflicted on that person; so whether\n",
      "it was ordered or not ordered by Duch.  Could you please verify?\n",
      "A. I did not see or hear it.  That's why I cannot presume that he\n",
      "ordered his subordinates to do that.  Or maybe his subordinates\n",
      "just did that by themselves.  I can say that without any order\n",
      "from their subordinates I don't even think that their\n",
      "subordinates could inflict any kind of tortures on them - on\n",
      "anyone.  So I could see that, after their work, they covered --\n",
      "you know, like, when they treated their staff, they would cover\n",
      "the blankets all over their body and walk them away because they\n",
      "were afraid to let us know.  I don't know, but I think it is just\n",
      "my presumption.\n",
      "Q. I think you probably be confused.  You are the survivor of\n",
      "that regime and that it is,\n",
      "of course, in your testimony reflecting your emotion and your\n",

      "Q. Could you please tell us why emotionally you said that you\n",
      "didn't follow along?  I understood that you were just obeying to\n",
      "an order, so therefore of course you were obeying physically, we\n",
      "could say, but why do you state that you did not obey\n",
      "emotionally?\n",

      "physically I followed the assignment and, as my skill was in\n",
      "drawing sketches, I just did it.  But in my mind I did not have\n",

      "reason?  Because I saw people being evacuated from the city, and\n",
      "the city became like a ghost city.  And this is my response to\n",
      "you.\n",

      "A. Ms. Defence Counsel, regarding my assignment as a painter or a\n",
      "sketch drawer, I had to do it.  I had to carry out my task and\n",
      "even if I completed and carried out my task 100 percent, I was\n",

      "So I was transferred to the Ta Lei Co-operative and that act made\n",
      "me lost my trust in that regime.\n",
      "Q. Given the answer, would you please give me the leave for\n",
      "another question?  Therefore, could I understand that it was\n",

      "A. I don't really understand your question.  Can you ask the\n",
      "question again?\n",
      "Q. You are telling us that if you did not follow the orders 100\n",
      "percent that were given to you that you could be transferred.  So\n",
      "therefore can I conclude from this answer that it was fear that\n",
