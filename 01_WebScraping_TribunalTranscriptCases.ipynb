      "when the civil parties are putting questions to the witness or\n",
      "the accused.\n",
      "So the time is calculated based on the time when the civil\n",

      "and observing the proceedings, and we will see if there is any\n",
      "time used other than the times used by the civil parties during\n",
      "the given time.  Then the Chamber would like to give extra time\n",
      "to them.  So we would be flexible accordingly.\n",
      "The starting time of the session can be flexible also, depending\n",
      "on something that happens practically in the Court, and yesterday\n",
      "we had some problems because the witness was very emotional while\n",
      "he was being asked by the prosecutor, and the prosecutors have\n",
      "not used all the times given to them, and for the civil parties\n",
      "we have observed that they have not used up all the times\n",
      "allocated to them.\n",
      "The calculation of the times for the civil parties are\n",
      "appropriate.  It doesn't mean that the calculation is based on a\n",
      "few questions the civil parties would put to the witness or to\n",
      "the accused, but it's based on the proportion.\n",
      "Regarding the survivors of the regime, we note that they have\n",
      "been very emotional and yesterday, after having examined how we\n",
      "could control the witness when he or she is very emotional and we\n",
      "also checked to see whether there are doctors or psychiatrists on\n",
      "standby, then the Court would seek their assistance to help that\n",
      "witness before we proceeded further.\n",
      "However, after a few moments, we observed that the witness could\n",
      "recompose himself and that he was under control to respond to\n",
      "further questions.  Of course, the Trial Chamber is taking into\n",
      "consideration these matters seriously.\n",
      "And the civil parties, the lawyers representing the parties, are\n",
      "also to be vigilant.  I mean they should be vigilant when they\n",
      "notice that their clients need such assistance.  Then they can\n",
      "remind the Chamber, but I think probably it would not be\n",
      "appropriate if the civil party lawyer asked for like a half-day\n",
      "break for a witness to recompose him or herself.  Then it would\n",
      "be a long break for him, which could also affect the schedule of\n",
      "the hearing.\n",
      "We believe that the psychiatrists have already been employed to\n",
      "assist the clients or the witnesses, and they are ready to be of\n",
      "any assistance when needed.  So we do not really intend to really\n",
      "incite the emotions of the witnesses until he or she cries, so\n",
      "emotionally that it could even affect his mental fitness and, of\n",
      "course, the Chamber is well informed of this.\n",
      "To sum up, the Trial Chamber is very deliberate when it comes to\n",
      "the calculation of times allocated to parties, however, the times\n",
      "for objections have not been included in the allocated times to\n",
      "the parties.  So the parties could still exercise their full\n",
      "rights to use the full time allocated to them, except the\n",
      "objections or any matter that arises during such proceedings.\n",
      "We, as human beings, are cautious and we really take the concerns\n",
      "or remarks raised by the civil parties, and we really appreciate\n",
      "the civil parties to raise these before the Chamber so that we\n",
      "can take immediate action to make sure that the witness can be\n",
      "under his control of emotions.  Of course, if the Chamber noted\n",

      "the technical school in Ruessei Keo.  I did the drawing and the\n",
      "sketches for the workshop participants.  It was at the technical\n",
      "school in Ruessei Keo.\n",
      "Q. You can just continue to describe your accounts from the time\n",
      "that you were at the Ruessei Keo Technical School until you were\n",
      "free from the Tuol Sleng on the 7th of January 1979.  If you can,\n",
      "describe all those accounts.\n",
      "If you can not, then the Chamber would put some questions to you\n",
      "based on the certain periods of the events.\n",
      "A. Mr. President, during the times that I served at the Ruessei\n",
      "Keo Technical School, I had worked for about one year; I cannot\n",
      "recall exactly.  My apology if I cannot recall the exact date due\n",
      "to the serious torture that I received.  So my memory is not in\n",
      "great shape.\n",
      "In 1976, Angkar arrested my superior, Hak, from the Ruessei Keo\n",
      "Technical School.  Two or three months later, the Southwest Group\n",
      "came to take control of that school.  I was then transferred to\n",
      "Ta Lei Co-operative in Dangkao Commune, Dangkao district, Dangkao\n",
      "province.  It was the co-operative with the education site.\n",
      "At that time, I was forced by Angkar to dig canals from Ta Lei\n",
      "village to the Prey Sar prison.  I was forced to build dams, to\n",
      "dig canals actively, so I was so severely physically used to\n",
      "provide the labour to Angkar.  It was to the limit of my physical\n",
      "stance to do that labour.\n",
      "Later on, Angkar ordered me to the group of adult people to make\n",
      "ploughs and some other wooden tools, rakes, and the chief of the\n",
      "group was Pak.  We called him Brother Pak.  It was still at the\n",
      "Ta Lei Co-operative.\n",
      "And later on, I was assigned to plant vegetables, and while I was\n",
      "working the soil at the vegetable beds, I grew cabbage, and over\n",
      "there we use human fertilizer.  It was called fertilizer number\n",
      "one.\n",
      "And one day, there was a group of people in black clothes.  I\n",
      "think they were driving a Jeep, if I can recall correctly.  At\n",
      "that time, I was planting eggplants.  I was told by that group\n",
      "that Angkar required me and my wife to prepare my belonging in\n",
      "order to teach the children at the school of fine arts.\n",
      "By hearing that, I thought that would be right because it's my\n",
      "expertise.  So I was happy, very happy, and I thought that I\n",
      "would now work in my right profession.  However, unfortunately,\n",
      "at that time when I was in the car with my wife in that Jeep, I\n",
      "was taken to a location near Kirirom location and I thought that\n",
      "was not the way to the school of fine arts.\n",
      "I felt uneased and I felt a bit scared and I felt I was dizzy.\n",
      "For about a half-an-hour later, we reached a location which was\n",
      "unknown to me at the time and the chief stopped there.  And we\n",
      "entered a house which was near by the Tuol Sleng prison or the\n",
      "S-21 Office.  There was a house opposite that office.\n",
      "They had two rows of chairs and we were asked to get off the car\n",
      "and we went to sit on the chairs.  Then there was a person who\n",
      "ordered me to put my hands behind my back, so my wife and I put\n",
      "our hands behind our backs and they cuffed our hands.\n",
      "Then my wife started crying and said, \"What do I do wrong?  We\n",
      "both are orphans.\"  I was so pitiful of my wife.  At that time,\n",
      "they used a piece of black cloth to blindfold both of us, my wife\n",
      "and I.  Then we were walked into the S-21 Security Office or Tuol\n",
      "Sleng prison.  Then I realized that was a prison.  From then\n",
      "onward, I was asked to enter a room and I was photographed.\n",
      "After they photographed my wife, then they photographed me, and\n",
      "that was the only photograph of my wife that I have had with me\n",
      "until today because I lost all the photos from the 7th of January\n",
      "1979.  And with me I only have a photo of my wife that I would\n",
      "like to show to the judges.\n",
      "After we were photographed, we were walked to Building C and from\n",
      "that time onward, I separated from my wife.  I did not know which\n",
      "building she was taken to.\n",
      "So I was placed in the common room on the upper floor.  I think\n",
      "about five months or one year later, I received torture.  First,\n",
      "I was threatened that they would peel my skin.  I didn't know\n",
      "what it means by that, but a person who slept next to me told me\n",
      "that it means that you will be beaten during the interrogation\n",
      "and I felt so horrified in my mind.  I was so shocked.  I\n",
      "thought, what mistake did I make?  I tried my best to serve\n",
      "Angkar.  And in the end, I became and fell into such a situation\n",
      "so I kept thinking.\n",
      "While I was in the prison, all the clothes were stripped off\n",
      "except my underwear.  So I slept directly on the floor for\n",
      "several months.\n",
      "Then they started to interrogate me and beat me up.  It was --\n",
      "the interrogation location was in a house outside the compound.\n",
      "It was behind the Building A.  They cut me and they asked me to\n",
      "lie down on the floor with my face facing down and they had a\n",
      "bunch of sticks and they dropped it on the floor and it made\n",
      "noise.  And I was asked to choose which stick I preferred.  And I\n",
      "responded, \"Whichever stick I choose, it is still a stick that\n",
      "you will use to beat me up so it is up to you, Brother, to decide\n",
      "which one you want to use.\"\n",
      "Mam Nai stood up and grabbed a stick and started to beat me up.\n",
      "After he felt exhausted, then another person came to take turn to\n",
      "beat me up.  So that Mam Nai was Mam Nai alias Chan.  He got his\n",
      "skin condition with a spotty skins and quite a red in his face.\n",
      "He asked me to count the lashes and when I counted up to 10\n",
      "lashes, he said, \"How come you count to 10 lashes?  I only beat\n",
      "you for one lash.\"\n",
      "I was -- I felt so painful at the time.  There were wounds --\n",
      "many wounds on my back and the blood was on the floor flowing\n",
      "from my back.  Whips were also used to torture me.  I was so\n",
      "shocked and painful.\n",
      "Every time they beat me up, they asked me questions; when did I\n",
      "join the CIA and, \"Who introduced you into the CIA network and\n",
      "what was their name?\"  And I responded that I did not know.  So\n",
      "the first beating, I responded I did not know.  The second time\n",
      "of the beating, the third times; I gave the same response.  Even\n",
      "if my back had wound, they beat on that wound.  It was so painful\n",
      "and I could not think of any mistake that I made.  I did not know\n",
      "what CIA or KGB network was; then how could I respond?  So they\n",
      "just kept beating me up.  I had a lot of scars on my back as\n",
      "evidence from that torture.\n",
      "In my mind, I thought of my mother; that if I could live, I would\n",
      "pray.  Probably it's because of my mother that gave me birth.\n",
      "And I would -- and I thought that if I could lived to give my\n",
      "story to the Chamber and now, finally, I am before the ECCC and\n",
      "that the ECCC would  find justice for me.  And I feel so happy\n",
      "even if 100 percent of justice cannot be provided by the Chamber,\n",
      "50 or 60 percent of justice to me is fine because I determined\n",
      "from the prison where I was detained that I had not committed any\n",
      "mistake or offence and that I prayed just to be survived.\n",
      "Q. Uncle Meng, please try to recompose yourself so that you would\n",
      "have the\n",
      "opportunity to tell your story.\n",
      "As you have stated, you have been waiting for this opportunity to\n",
      "tell your accounts, your experience and the sufferings that you\n",
      "received from those unjust acts; from the torture committed by\n",
      "the Khmer Rouge, as well as the ill treatment on your wife.  So\n",
      "please try to be strong, recompose yourself so that you are in a\n",
      "better position to recount what they did on you so that the\n",
      "public and the Chamber who are participating in this proceeding\n",
      "or the Cambodian people as a whole as well as the international\n",
      "community to hear, to understand the acts committed by the Khmer\n",
      "Rouge clique on you and that they would express the pityness on\n",
      "you as you received those ill treatment from them.  So do not let\n",
      "your emotion overwhelm you.  So try to grab the opportunity to\n",
      "tell your accounts to the Chamber as well as to the public.\n",
      "Uncle Meng, do you understand what I said?\n",
      "A. Yes, Mr. President; I understand.\n",
      "Q. Please try to recompose and be strong.  Today is the\n",
      "opportunity for you to reveal, to describe your sufferings to the\n",
      "Chamber so that the Chamber can understand.  If your emotion\n",
      "overwhelms you, then it's unlikely that we have another time to\n",
      "hear your account because the Chamber has scheduled other\n",
      "witnesses to provide the testimonies and they had gone through\n",
      "similar experiences, either at S-21 or Prey Sar -- although some\n",
      "of them are not the direct victims but they're relatives or\n",
      "family members, wives, husbands, parents -- received the unjust\n",
      "acts over there.\n",
      "So, in summary, please continue to recount the experience and the\n",
      "sufferings that you received from those unjust acts during the\n",
      "time that you were detained until the day you were free from that\n",
      "prison, thanks to the National United Front for Salvation armies\n",
      "on the 7 January '79.  Do you understand what I said?\n",
      "A. Yes, I can continue, Mr. President.\n",
      "Let me go back a little bit because I forgot to talk about the\n",
      "food ration in the common room.  In that common room, there were\n",
      "about 30 or 40 of us and at one corner I saw foreigners with\n",
      "light complexions and they were detained there as well, and they\n",
      "received the same food ration; that is, very thin gruel.  There\n",
      "was no rice grain in there, just one (inaudible) or one there,\n",
      "and I was so skinny I had no strength.  Even if I had a stick, I\n",
      "would not be able to use it to attack them.\n",
      "When Him Huy took me to the upper floor, he rode on my neck, on\n",
      "my shoulder, and I stumbled on the stairs and my knee was hurt\n",
      "and there was a wound on my knee.  So when I think of those\n",
      "events, I felt so painful.\n",
      "Each day when they took me for interrogation they took me twice,\n",
      "from 7 to 12 in the morning, and in the afternoon from 2 to\n",
      "or \n",
      " \n",
      "          6\n",
      "p.m.  The interrogators who beat me up, I could recognize their            7   faces because when they talked to each other, I recognized their\n",
      "names.\n",
      "They were Brother Mam Nai, Comrade Hor, Comrade Huy, Comrade Tith\n",
      "and Peng, so there were five of them altogether.  My apology that\n",
      "I went back to describe this account because I forgot.\n",
      "Q. As I told you, please try to re-compose yourself.  This is the\n",
      "day that you have been waiting for for so long.  I know you are\n",
      "very emotional now and probably you will miss certain events that\n",
      "you would want to recount.  Of course, the sufferings you and\n",
      "your wife received were indescribable and right now the Chamber\n",
      "would like to ask you some questions.\n",
      "When there was a vehicle going to pick you up from the Ta Lei\n",
      "Co-operative in Dangkao district to the School of Fine Arts, were\n",
      "you tied or cuffed, and what about your wife?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, Your Honours, at that time I saw a vehicle but\n",
      "there were no cuffs in there.  We were asked to pack our clothes,\n",
      "so I had some clothes so I put them in my backpack and they were\n",
      "all taken away at Tuol Sleng.\n",
      "Q. When they took you to Tuol Sleng, did they take you to Tuol\n",
      "Sleng straight away or were you taken to another place first?\n",
      "For example, like the place that you described where there were\n",
      "two rows of chairs.  Was it within the compound of the Tuol Sleng\n",
      "prison?\n",
      "A. It was outside the Tuol Sleng prison.  It was opposite the\n",
      "Tuol Sleng prison.  There was a house and there were two rows of\n",
      "chairs, and in the middle there was a long table.  So we were\n",
      "asked to enter that house and they ordered us to put our hands\n",
      "behind us and then they cuffed our hands, both of us.\n",
      "Q. When they ordered you to put your hands behind your back and\n",
      "then later you were cuffed, did they tell you the reasons for the\n",
      "arrest of your wife and yourself?  Did they tell you the reasons?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, at that time they did not tell us any reasons\n",
      "or any mistakes we made, and I and my wife asked them what\n",
      "mistake did we do and we told them that we were orphans and what\n",
      "mistakes we did?  And they replied, \"You, the contemptible, you\n",
      "don't have to ask.  Angkar has many eyes, like pineapples, and\n",
      "Angkar only arrests those who make mistakes or offence.\"  And I\n",
      "was still wondering what mistakes I did, and my wife wondered the\n",
      "same.\n",
      "At that time. I was in the adult group in the co-operative to\n",
      "make ploughs and rakes, and my wife worked in the rice fields and\n",
      "I could not think of any mistake that my wife and I made.  Until\n",
      "today, I could not think of the mistakes that I made at the time.\n",
      "Q. The people who ordered you to put your hands behind your backs\n",
      "and then they cuffed you and your wife, were they the same people\n",
      "who went to pick you up from Ta Lei Co-operative?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, they were different people.  They were not\n",
      "those who took me, who brought me from the co-operative.  They\n",
      "were there waiting for us in that room.  So once we entered the\n",
      "house we were asked to sit, in a nice gesture, and later on what\n",
      "happened I already described to you.\n",
      "So I broke into my tears because I did not know what offence I\n",
      "committed.  If I stay home and did nothing, maybe I made a\n",
      "mistake, but I did not do that and I cannot think of the mistake\n",
      "I committed.  Whatever I was asked by Angkar, I just did.\n",
      "Q. Can you recall the day that you were arrested and taken to\n",
      "Tuol Sleng prison or can you recall the year?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I can remember the year.  It was 1977 when I\n",
      "was entered into the S-21 Office.  I am a bit weak on the month\n",
      "because at that time there was no calendar to see, so it's only\n",
      "just based on the thinking or estimation.  I think it could be in\n",
      "May or June in 1977.\n",
      "The reason why I thought it was in May or June because after they\n",
      "tortured me and they were fed-up with torturing me, there was a\n",
      "teenager about 16 or 17 years old made an announcement.  He said,\n",
      "\"In this room, who can do the painting?\"  So I raised my hand.  I\n",
      "said, yes, I can do the painting.\n",
      "And that person ordered another person to unshackle me and they\n",
      "then put a chain on one of my feet.  I was then walked from the\n",
      "upper floor of that C Building to the ground floor in order to\n",
      "meet Mr. Duch.  The reason I recognized him because when I was\n",
      "painting the portrait of Pol Pot, he was sitting nearby me,\n",
      "watching me, sitting on a chair with his legs crossed.  I did a\n",
      "lot of portraits, not only just for Pol Pot, I also did a\n",
      "portrait for Mao Zhedong.\n",
      "Q. The Chamber asked you to describe about the situation but you\n",
      "have not been able to detail what we asked you, so I would like\n",
      "you to please listen to the question of the Chamber step-by-step\n",
      "until the 7th of January 1979.\n",
      "I think would you please wait until the question is referred to a\n",
      "particular section that you can respond otherwise you would not\n",
      "be able to recall the consequential event.  So could you please\n",
      "be waiting for the question from the Chamber before you could\n",
      "respond to them?\n",
      "When you were arrested and sent to S-21, were you sent in at\n",
      "night or in the daytime?\n",
      "A. It was at about 9 or 10, I can't remember it well, and when I\n",
      "reached Tuol Sleng there was no clock that I could check the\n",
      "time, but it was during the daytime not at night.\n",
      "Q. When you were handcuffed all together with your wife and\n",
      "walked into Tuol Sleng compound, were you both blindfolded?\n",
      "A. We were blindfolded before we were walked into Tuol Sleng\n",
      "compound.\n",
      "Q. You stated earlier that when you entered the location you were\n",
      "taken photograph.  Before the photos were taken, did they ask you\n",
      "for your biography or was it done later after the photography?\n",
      "A. I don't remember all.  Please accept my apologies.\n",
      "I think the document from Tuol Sleng still survives and the\n",
      "person who kept the record was Ti (phonetic), and I was shocked\n",
      "and confused because I did not know why I was arrested and I did\n",
      "not know how I responded to them.  I did not know whether my\n",
      "biography would have been sent to them earlier, prior to my\n",
      "arrest.  I'm not sure.\n",
      "Q. You said your wife and yourself were blindfolded.  Were you\n",
      "still being blindfolded while being taken photograph or were the\n",
      "blindfolds removed?\n",
      "A. When we were at the photo workshop then our blindfolds were\n",
      "removed, and we were seated and I was taken photograph and\n",
      "followed by my wife.\n",
      "Q. What about the handcuffs?  Were you removed from the handcuffs\n",
      "while being photographed?\n",
      "A. I don't recall having been removed from the handcuffs.  I'm\n",
      "not sure; I forget it.  Maybe the handcuffs were removed or maybe\n",
      "they were not.  But so far as I remember after our photographs\n",
      "were taken, then we were blindfolded again before we were walked\n",
      "to Building C.\n",
      "Q. You said you were stripped to your underwear.  When was that,\n",
      "before you were sent to Building C or only after you got to\n",
      "Building C that your clothes were stripped off?\n",
      "A. I think maybe my clothes were stripped off downstairs before\n",
      "we were walked upstairs or maybe only when we reached upstairs\n",
      "that our clothes were stripped off.  I seem to forget.  But as I\n",
      "remember, it is sure that after we were taken photographs then we\n",
      "were re-blindfolded and I did not know where my wife would be\n",
      "walked to.\n",
      "Q. When you reached the building, it was the common building for\n",
      "all prisoners or it was a separate prison cell for detaining you\n",
      "alone?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, at that time I was put in a common large room\n",
      "in which about 20 to 30 detainees were placed.  They all looked\n",
      "like hell because their hairs grew long, even they were male but\n",
      "their hairs grew so long.  I felt dizzy when I entered the room\n",
      "and I was so confused.\n",
      "Q. When you were being handcuffed, were you handcuffed and\n",
      "attached to the bar, the metal bar with the other detainees, or\n",
      "you were handcuffed and then isolated?  Could you please tell us\n",
      "about the condition of the shackles?\n",
      "A. We were put into the common rooms and in each metal bar\n",
      "resembled the shackles.  There were a lot of detainees attached\n",
      "to the shackles by our ankles, maybe five to 10 people for each\n",
      "long shackles and we were put to sleep head to head with other\n",
      "detainees, so my head was put against the east wall.\n",
      "Q. At that time could you sit up when your both legs were\n",
      "shackled to the long bar like that?\n",
      "A. I could sit up but we had to ask permission from the guards\n",
      "before we could relieve ourselves, although we were given an\n",
      "ammunitions box for such purpose and we were given a plastic jug\n",
      "for our urination.\n",
      "Q. Who collect the wastes or were they left with the detainees\n",
      "all day?\n",
      "A. At that time the people who worked there in the common cell,\n",
      "the person whose age was about 15 years old, would go up and\n",
      "collect the waste because the detainees would only be put to lie\n",
      "down in the cell and could not be moved.\n",
      "Q. You mentioned about the food ration, the thin gruel with very\n",
      "few rice grains and sometimes you would be offered a watery soup\n",
      "with water grass.  The question is how food was provided to you?\n",
      "Were you fed with a plate, a spoon or what was it like when food\n",
      "was delivered to you, and how often did you get the meals?\n",
      "A. When it was time to eat it was at 12 or 11.30; let's say\n",
      "between 11.30 to 1.  That's for lunch.  In the afternoon, late\n",
      "afternoon, the food was served at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. and when the\n",
      "food was carried to the place then they would leave it there, and\n",
      "if people made noise then they would be beaten with the stick\n",
      "that they used to carry the food to the detainees.  I felt very\n",
      "pity for them and for myself because we were treated like\n",
      "animals.  We whispered to one another, I mean to the neighbours,\n",
      "but we could not make loud noise.\n",
      "Q. Did the detainees have to share -- have to distribute the\n",
      "porridge or the gruel, or were they distributed by the guards?\n",
      "A. We were given the gruel on a plate by the guards, and after we\n",
      "finished the meal then the plates and spoon would be collected\n",
      "because they were afraid that those items could be used for the\n",
      "detainee to commit suicide, because every night people would come\n",
      "to search for any metal items or sharp items.  I did not know why\n",
      "they came to search for those items.\n",
      "Q. When you were thirsty what would you do?\n",
      "A. We had to ask for permission; for example, \"Brother, I am\n",
      "thirsty.  Could you please give me some water?\"\n",
      "Q. So it means in the common cell there were the prison guards\n",
      "who stationed there regularly.  Is that correct?\n",
      "Please wait until you see the red light before you respond.\n",
      "A. When I needed some water I would ask them for the water and\n",
      "they would give it to me.\n",
      "THE INTERPRETER:\n",
      "The President's mic is not on.\n",
      "BY MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. Now, you have not answered the questions about the guards who\n",
      "would be regularly stationed at the cell, and you said that when\n",
      "you would like to relieve yourself or you were thirsty you would\n",
      "ask the guard.  My question was:  were there regular prison\n",
      "guards at that location, and how many guards were there in your\n",
      "room?\n",
      "A. I think guards would be seen walking on the corridor, several\n",
      "of them, because we were locked inside and we could see them\n",
      "walking on the corridor, passing the windows.  And when we needed\n",
      "to relieve ourselves then we would call them.  But they gave us\n",
      "the boxes for relieving ourselves, although we were not removed\n",
      "our shackles.  But I seem to be forgotten when it comes to how we\n",
      "could ask them when we would like to relieve ourselves, but I am\n",
      "sure that we were shackled at all times.\n",
      "Q. I think we learned from you that there were the plastic jug\n",
      "and ammunition box placed for the detainees to relieve\n",
      "themselves, but when you were thirsty how could you do it,\n",
      "because there were no water jars left with water for detainees,\n",
      "so you had to shout to the guards?  I mean, if you shouted it\n",
      "means that the guards would be outside but if they were inside,\n",
      "the detainees would not need to shout to alert them.\n",
      "However, during the time when you had a bath -- because you were\n",
      "detained quite a long time from mid-1977 to 1979 and you were\n",
      "detained the longest there among the others, so when it comes to\n",
      "having a bath, what was it like?\n",
      "A. When we had a bath we would take off our shorts and then\n",
      "remove it from our legs, one leg at a time, and then we had to be\n",
      "naked and then the water would be sprayed from outside through a\n",
      "water hose, and some would get soaked, some would miss the water.\n",
      "And then we would use the clothes to dry the water.  It was so\n",
      "miserable because we would -- had been treated like the cattle\n",
      "while we were sprayed the water on.\n",
      "When we asked for water, of course we had to ask them for\n",
      "permission.  Otherwise we would never be given such water to\n",
      "drink.\n",
      "Q. You said you took off your shorts to dry the water.  What was\n",
      "the purpose of doing so?\n",
      "A. We only used them to dry the floor so that we could -- when\n",
      "the floor dried then we could lie down, because the water floods\n",
      "the floors and we had to dry it to make sure that it's dry.\n",
      "Q. So the purpose of removing your shorts was to dry the floor so\n",
      "that you could sleep on it.  Is that correct?\n",
      "A. That is correct, Mr. President.\n",
      "Q. How often were you sprayed the water on like this?\n",
      "A. Once every week or maybe once every fortnight.  I don't\n",
      "remember; you know, it has been 30 years or more already, but I\n",
      "know that every time we had a bath, everyone had to be naked.  It\n",
      "was like hell.\n",
      "Everyone would look the same and sometimes they mocked at us.\n",
      "They said that you guys look small physically but your thing was\n",
      "not that small.  I'm sorry to say that, but we would laugh by\n",
      "mocking on some other things, private things.\n",
      "Q. When you were detained, besides being removed from the\n",
      "shackles to be interrogated, were you released to do exercises,\n",
      "for example, every now and then or were you never allowed to do\n",
      "that?\n",
      "A. I don't remember it.  I think we were never allowed to do\n",
      "exercise in the room or maybe we were allowed to do so.  I am not\n",
      "sure because it has been so long already.\n",
      "Q. When you were taken to be interrogated, how was the process\n",
      "carried out?\n",
      "A. Every time I was taken to be interrogated, they would handcuff\n",
      "me and walked to the compound of the prison to Building A.  I\n",
      "think the previous trace of the building vanished over time and I\n",
      "think I could never take any visitors to the same original\n",
      "location as it already altered.\n",
      "Q. When you were removed from shackles, then you would be\n",
      "handcuffed before you would be walked to be interrogated.  Can\n",
      "you please tell us how this process would be carried out?\n",
      "A. I was walked to the interrogation room into the house.  We\n",
      "walked to upstairs.\n",
      "Q. No, I'm talking about the time when you were in the room and\n",
      "were shackled, and then you were shackled and attached to other\n",
      "people, other detainees.  And before you were taken to the\n",
      "interrogation room, would you be removed from the shackles and\n",
      "then walked outside of your room before you would be re-shackled\n",
      "again and walked to the interrogation room?\n",
      "A. They removed the shackles from the long bar.  The shackles\n",
      "were removed then they cuffed -- they put the cuffs on me again\n",
      "and then they walked to the outside area of the room, or the\n",
      "prison.\n",
      "Q. Were you blindfolded when you were being walked away?\n",
      "A. Of course, I was blindfolded while I was being walked away.\n",
      "Q. Could you please tell us about the moment when you were put\n",
      "into the room for interrogation?  How were you treated by the\n",
      "guards?\n",
      "A. They treated us -- they used derogatory language to me and\n",
      "they shackled me by my ankles -- the long bar of shackles which\n",
      "was about half a metre -- and then they locked the chain and then\n",
      "they closed all the windows and doors.  No, I think the windows\n",
      "would be left open because there were metal bars.  I could see\n",
      "Building A or B clearly.\n",
      "After I was shackled and they removed the handcuffs and removed\n",
      "the blindfold, and then they started to beat me to answer when I\n",
      "entered CIA and KGB.  I told them that I did not know anything\n",
      "about it and I could not answer anything about CIA and KGB.\n",
      "I kept repeating my response and they kept beating me and, of\n",
      "course, if we did not respond or answer to satisfy their request,\n",
      "then we would be beaten severely.\n",
      "Q. During the time when you were interrogated, you would be\n",
      "shackled and then you would be asked to sit on the floor while\n",
      "your handcuffs would be removed along with the blindfold before\n",
      "you would be interrogated.  In case you did not respond to what\n",
      "they wanted to get the confession from you, then you would be\n",
      "beaten with a stick.  Do I understand you correctly?\n",
      "A. They removed the blindfold and handcuffs.  They put me to lie\n",
      "face down and then they started to beat me until they had enough,\n",
      "and then they kept asking me when I entered CIA and KGB and who\n",
      "introduced me into the agents.  And I did not know how to respond\n",
      "to them because the person who worked honestly and worked the\n",
      "best to serve Angkar and never been involved in such\n",
      "organization, how could I respond to them that I introduced\n",
      "anyone into the CIA, even myself.  I did not know what CIA was.\n",
      "Q. You said you were shackled and put face down.  I find it\n",
      "difficult to understand because if you talk about the shackle,\n",
      "then you could sit up.  And how could you be put face down and\n",
      "then if you were shackled before that, you could not sit up\n",
      "because it was a wooden kind of shackles.  Then you put your legs\n",
      "-- or your legs were put into the shackle then you would not be\n",
      "able to lie face down on the floor.\n",
      "Or were you put to lie face down on the floor and tortured before\n",
      "they removed the shackles, and then -- or what?  Could you please\n",
      "clarify it to me or to the Court?\n",
      "A. It was not a wooden shackle, Mr. President.  It was a metal\n",
      "bar, long bar, designed to only put on one individual detainee.\n",
      "After having that long metal bar attached to my legs and my\n",
      "ankles, then they locked both ends and then they put me to lie\n",
      "face down in order for the interrogator to be able to beat me on\n",
      "my back and I could put my face down.\n",
      "Q. Were you taken to be interrogated immediately when you were\n",
      "sent during the first night at S-21 or were you kept a few days;\n",
      "only later that they would take you to be interrogated?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I was detained for quite a long time.  I think\n",
      "it was until May or June 1977 so I had been detained for four or\n",
      "five months before I was interrogated and tortured.  And as I\n",
      "stated earlier, then a guy came and asking for anyone who could\n",
      "paint.\n",
      "Q. Can you try to recall the S-21 staff who took you for\n",
      "interrogation and torture?  How many times were you taken and\n",
      "what about the types of torture?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, when -- for every times they interrogated and\n",
      "tortured me, they did not use or change the method.  First, they\n",
      "used a rattan stick or a whip to beat me up.  They beat me up\n",
      "with the stick or the whip for the two sessions.  So from 7 until\n",
      "12 or 1 p.m. in the morning, then I was allowed to eat and in the\n",
      "afternoon, they only stopped after 6 or 7 p.m. when I was taken\n",
      "back to the room.  After they beat me up, they did not take me to\n",
      "the common room.  They took me to the individual cell.  So every\n",
      "time after the interrogation and the torture, I was taken to the\n",
      "ground floor -- to the individual cell.  And for the mealtime,\n",
      "then we were fed with a bowl of food.\n",
      "Q. So in summary, you were detained in two different rooms.\n",
      "First, you were in the common room and about five months later,\n",
      "when they started to interrogate and torture you by using the\n",
      "stick, then you were detained in an individual cell.  Is that\n",
      "correct?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, that is correct.\n",
      "Q. Was your torture in a different method; for example, by\n",
      "electrocution?\n",
      "A. Yes, Mr. President.\n",
      "One day after they beat me down -- they beat me up, they walked\n",
      "me to Building D and there was a power outlet on the wall and\n",
      "then they used an electrical wire to electrocute me.  I felt\n",
      "unconscious and later on they used the water to pour on my face\n",
      "and I became unconscious again.  I did not know the voltage of\n",
      "that electricity, but once they started it, I felt unconscious\n",
      "immediately.  That was done in Building D.\n",
      "Q. I already asked you and you said that you did not know if you\n",
      "committed any offence so when you were detained in the prison,\n",
      "was there any decision by a trial committee to punish or sentence\n",
      "you -- for example, in a form of a trial in a similar form of\n",
      "this Chamber -- during your detention there?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, no, there was no judgment; no order from\n",
      "anybody.  We were just detained.  And one day after they\n",
      "exhausted by beating me up, then they walked me back into the\n",
      "room and while at the path walking to our Building D -- there was\n",
      "no concrete path there at the time  -- and at that juncture, I\n",
      "was beaten up again.  And another person came and said, \"Don't\n",
      "beat him up today because Brother instructed so.  Keep him\n",
      "alive.\"\n",
      "Because there were a lot of wounds on my back, I felt so painful,\n",
      "but because they beat me up so I had to lie down on my back.\n",
      "However, Him Huy used a stick to push under my back and a lot of\n",
      "gravels went inside the wound on my back so because it was so\n",
      "painful, then I had to turn myself again for them to beat me up\n",
      "on the back.\n",
      "Q. When did they decide to use you as a painter?\n",
      "A. One day, I was taken from that individual cell to the upper\n",
      "floor for treatment.  Actually, there was no medicine at all.\n",
      "There was a bowl of saltwater and they just poured that saltwater\n",
      "on my back and it was so, so painful because of my open wounds\n",
      "and the salt.  You could see when you used the salt on the frog,\n",
      "you could see the effects and you could imagine how painful it\n",
      "was when they pour the water -- the saltwater on my back.  And\n",
      "indeed, finally the wounds recovered from the saltwater.\n",
      "Sometimes, I was given a rabbit pellet tablet.  It was so\n",
      "miserable.\n",
      "Q. And now to the scars from the beating; do you still have the\n",
      "scars or are they completely gone?\n",
      "A. The wounds recovered, but the scars are everywhere on my back,\n",
      "on my shoulders.  They were the scars from being whipped or\n",
      "beaten.  Sometimes, there were five of them beating me up at the\n",
      "same time.\n",
      "Q. Can we see the scars on your back?\n",
      "MS. STUDZINSKY:\n",
      "Mr. President, I would like to make break now before Mr. Bou Meng\n",
      "shows his scars and to decide if this is appropriate -- an\n",
      "appropriate measure now and maybe it is time for an adjournment,\n",
      "and that would be great if he could get it.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Now it is time for a break.  The Chamber will take a 20 minute\n",
      "break until 11 a.m. when the Chamber will resume.\n",
      "(Judges exit courtroom)\n",
      "(Court recesses from 10H38 until 11H02)\n",
      "(Judges enter courtroom)\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Please be seated.  The Chamber is now back in session.\n",
      "We would like to inform the parties and the public that the\n",
      "Chamber now cancels its attempts to show the scars on the\n",
      "survivor's back and all parties are also reminded not to proceed\n",
      "with the request to show the scars on the survivor's back.\n",
      "Do you have any further requests or observations?\n",
      "MS. STUDZINSKY:\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President.  We would suggest to proceed in closed\n",
      "session and then Mr. Bou Meng could show the scars to the Chamber\n",
      "and the parties.  That is something that could be a possibility\n",
      "to do.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "The Chamber already decided to cancel its attempts to show the\n",
      "scars, even if in an in camera hearing.  In case of necessity, it\n",
      "can be shown by photos.  So the photos can be shown of the scars\n",
      "on his back.  Bou Meng, you think you can have those photos for\n",
      "the Chamber?\n",
      "MR. BOU MENG:\n",
      "Mr. President, I do not have any photos of the marks.  I only\n",
      "have the marks on my body.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "The Chamber would like to request to take photos of your -- of\n",
      "the scars or your marks that can be displayed on the screen.  Do\n",
      "you agree to this proposal?\n",
      "MR. BOU MENG:\n",
      "Yes, I agree.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. Next, so you were chosen to be a painter.  When were you\n",
      "chosen?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, towards the later '77, because in early 1978 I\n",
      "already painted a canvas.  One day I heard the noise from the\n",
      "loudspeaker, I think they celebrated something at the Olympic\n",
      "Stadium, and we were given a lot of food.  We ate to our fill and\n",
      "the guards gave us the food.  And I even have the noodles,\n",
      "Chinese noodles to eat.\n",
      "And Nath said I had to jump, to jump up so that the food will go\n",
      "down lower through my stomach and I can eat more to fill to my\n",
      "stomach.  And I told him, \"Once you are full, you are full.  You\n",
      "only have one stomach to fill in.\"\n",
      "I think I started painting the portrait in late '77 or early '78\n",
      "because there were four portraits and each portrait, when Duch\n",
      "asked me, \"How long did it take to make that portrait?  And the\n",
      "portrait must look the same as the photo,\" and I told him -- I\n",
      "requested to have three months to make that portrait because the\n",
      "canvas was huge.  It was 1.5 metres wide and three metres high.\n",
      "I would like to seek your permission to show the portrait of Pol\n",
      "Pot that I painted.  I survived because I could paint the exact\n",
      "portrait of Pol Pot, so I was spared until to the 7th January,\n",
      "'79.\n",
      "This is my response, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. During the time that you were released to work by doing the\n",
      "painting, where did you paint and who else worked with you in\n",
      "that location?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, yes, I myself, Bou Meng; Vann Nath too; Im\n",
      "Chan, the wood sculptor and the wax moulder, another wax moulder;\n",
      "so that's all.  And we worked in Building E.  Building E is the\n",
      "building in the middle of the compound.  I think that is used as\n",
      "the reception area for the guests who come to visit the museum.\n",
      "Q. What about the food ration after you were chosen to work as a\n",
      "painter?  Was the food ration the same as those given to the\n",
      "prisoners?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, the food ration was better than previously, so\n",
      "it was from the thin gruel to rice and we had sufficient soup.\n",
      "So the prison guard carried the soup to deliver it to us and we\n",
      "shared among ourselves.\n",
      "Q. During the time you were selected to work as a painter, where\n",
      "were you allowed to sleep at night?\n",
      "A. After I painted and when it was time to sleep, it was at the\n",
      "generator's room.  It was behind Building E.  At that time there\n",
      "was a generator there, so when the electricity was cut off, then\n",
      "they started the generator and we slept in that generator's room.\n",
      "Q. Were you cuffed or shackled in that room or were you locked\n",
      "from outside?\n",
      "A. I was allowed to sleep in that room but I was not cuffed or\n",
      "shackled, so there was seven of us -- Oeng Bech, Vann Nath, Im\n",
      "Chan, Pha Tha Chan, Ruy Makong.  There were seven of us -- and\n",
      "Chum Mey.  I requested to see the photo: Pha Tha Chan, Bou Meng,\n",
      "Vann Nath, Im Chan, Ruy Makong and Chum Mey.  And now only Chum\n",
      "Mey, Vann Nath and Bou Meng are alive.  The other four died.\n",
      "MS. STUDZINSKY:\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to suggest to the Court\n",
      "officials to show the photo on the screen.  Thank you.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "I don't think it is yet your time.  It is now my question and I\n",
      "have the discretion.\n",
      "BY MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. During the times you were asked to do the painting, did you\n",
      "meet the accused, Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, Your Honours, at that time Mr. Kaing Guek Eav,\n",
      "alias Duch, sat next to me watching me painting the portrait of\n",
      "Brother Number One, Pol Pot, and he ordered me, \"You should\n",
      "adjust the throat.  It's not a tumour, it's just fat.\"  So as can\n",
      "be seen from this photo which was taken of the portraits that I\n",
      "painted, so you could see that the throat was slimmer.\n",
      "Q. Did he come to visit you often to see you painting?  And if he\n",
      "came, during the day or nighttime?\n",
      "A. He came often during the daytime and he wore shorts and a\n",
      "short-sleeved shirt.  So he came in, he sat with his one leg\n",
      "across and watching me drawing, for example, another portrait of\n",
      "the head of Ho Chi Minh on the body of a dog.  It was like a\n",
      "cartoon which they -- it was like a sketch of the sea with a\n",
      "flat, windy situation, et cetera and et cetera.\n",
      "Q. Did you notice his character and behaviour during the time\n",
      "that he watched you making the painting or the portrait?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, he did not really beat me up, however, one day\n",
      "I didn't know what I did wrong.  He asked me and Im Chan to beat\n",
      "each other up.  So we were given a piece of black plastic tube to\n",
      "hit, to beat each other, and he sat there watching us beating\n",
      "each other up.  After a while he ordered us to stop.\n",
      "But if I could make a very lifelike portrait, he would look at it\n",
      "carefully and I think I lost some of the portraits.\n",
      "Q. The question is, did you observe his facial expression or his\n",
      "behaviour; that is the behaviour of the accused, Kaing Guek Eav,\n",
      "alias Duch, during the time that he went to watch you painting?\n",
      "Was he a person full of joy or full of sorrow?  Did you notice\n",
      "that?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, his facial expression was normal.  If he needed\n",
      "to laugh, he laughed.  Sometimes he smiled.  I could see him\n",
      "through his face but I could not judge his feeling or emotion,\n",
      "and that's the word I was asked especially by a journalist, and I\n",
      "always tell them, \"I know his face but I don't know his feeling\".\n",
      "He was close to me, observing me painting.  Sometimes he gave me\n",
      "cigarettes to smoke.\n",
      "Q. Did he ever beat you up personally?\n",
      "A. No, but he ordered me to beat up with Im Chan.  I was not\n",
      "happy with that.  He did not treat me like a human being.\n",
      "Q. Did you ever see him going from one building to the next\n",
      "within the compound of the prison; for example, from Building A\n",
      "to B to C, or did he only enter the compound and only come to the\n",
      "place where you worked?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I did not see him walking along each building\n",
      "because when he entered his main focus was on the portrait of\n",
      "Brother Number One, Pol Pot.  I only saw him coming to my\n",
      "workshop.  I did not see him going anywhere else.\n",
      "Q. So besides him, besides you yourself, did you see him\n",
      "torturing or beating up other prisoners?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, let me go back a little bit.\n",
      "One day there was a Vietnamese citizen.  He boasted that he could\n",
      "make a wax mould and then he was ordered to show his skill.  So\n",
      "he was tested and Duch saw that he could not do it.  Then he\n",
      "ordered the interrogators to kick him like kick a ball because,\n",
      "from what I understood, he was angry that that person lied to\n",
      "him.  And I did not know what happened to that Vietnamese person.\n",
      "Probably he was taken out.\n",
      "Q. Did he himself order the guards or his subordinates to torture\n",
      "that person?  And if he did order, can you recall his exact\n",
      "words; that is, the words that Duch used to order his\n",
      "subordinates to torture that Vietnamese person?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I forget some parts.  I am not sure.  I think\n",
      "probably he signalled his guards to beat that Vietnamese person.\n",
      "And the Vietnamese person was taken away from the workshop where\n",
      "I worked.  So there were woodcrafters; there was a painter and\n",
      "another artist.  We worked in the same workshop.\n",
      "Q. You saw the guards beating up that person who boasted about\n",
      "his skill.  Was the beating taking place within the workshop\n",
      "vicinity in Building E or was he taken out and beaten up outsides\n",
      "that area?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, at that time the three or four of them kicked\n",
      "that Vietnamese person and beat him up and walked him away.  I\n",
      "did not hear his order.  So when those guards beat the Vietnamese\n",
      "person up, Duch had already left.\n",
      "Q. So during the time you were asked to work as a painter, how\n",
      "many portraits did you paint and whose portraits were they?\n",
      "A. There were four portraits of Pol Pot.  However, there was\n",
      "another portrait in 1981.  There was a German group to make a\n",
      "film on that portrait, so I showed the portrait to the person and\n",
      "then I used paint to make a cross sign on that person to express\n",
      "my hatred of that person, and that was filmed by the German\n",
      "group.\n",
      "Q. You said that you painted various other paintings or\n",
      "portraits; for example, a painting of a dog with the Ho Hi Minh\n",
      "head on it.  But for Pol Pot portraits you only made four\n",
      "portraits?\n",
      "A. That is correct, Mr. President.\n",
      "Q. So besides the portraits of Brother Number One, Pol Pot, did\n",
      "you make any other painting or portrait?\n",
      "A. Mr., President, yes, I painted Hua Guofeng, Mao Zhedong in\n",
      "large canvas as well, so the canvas was as big as the canvas for\n",
      "Pol Pot's portrait.\n",
      "Q. When you did your painting or portrait, did you do it\n",
      "individually or together with Vann Nath?  That is, Vann Nath was\n",
      "painting his own painting or portrait and you yourself had a\n",
      "separate painting or portrait?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, at that time he did not have a skill of\n",
      "painting black and white portraits so I mixed the black and white\n",
      "painting by myself with one litre of gasoline to burn it and the\n",
      "smoke would go into that painting and then I mixed it.  And Vann\n",
      "Nath did not have this skill.\n",
      "Q. So it means that your painting was separate from him because\n",
      "one was colour and one was black and white.  Is that correct?\n",
      "A. Yes, that is correct.\n",
      "Q. You talked about the portrait of Pol Pot.  This is one of the\n",
      "portraits of other people that you painted.  Is that correct?\n",
      "A. Yes, Mr. President, that is correct.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Court officer, can you take a photo of the portrait of Pol Pot to\n",
      "be projected on the monitor, on the slide?\n",
      "BY MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Q. Is this the portrait of Pol Pot that you painted by yourself\n",
      "during the time that you were detained there and then when you\n",
      "were asked to make a drawing or portrait of the leader of the\n",
      "Democratic Kampuchea?\n",
      "A. Yes, Mr. President, this is the portrait.\n",
      "Q. You stated just then that because of your skill of making the\n",
      "portrait that you survived until today.  Can you explain further\n",
      "the reason of this portrait that led to the survival?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, the reason, from my understanding, is that my\n",
      "painting is a resemblance of the photo, so I started painting\n",
      "portraits 1, 2, 3 and 4 and another one.  While I was painting,\n",
      "then the time came when the Vietnamese and the National United\n",
      "Front for Salvation army entered Phnom Penh and we fled.\n",

      "you were sent to Prey Sar and then you stayed at Prey Sar for a\n",
      "while before you were returned to S-21.  What happened back then?\n",
      "Is it true that you were sent there?\n",
      "A. I think it is not true because I stayed in Tuol Sleng prison,\n",
      "but when we were evacuated it would be true that I was walking\n",
      "and reached Prey Sar somewhere near Boeung Choueng Ek for about\n",
      "five minutes, and then we later on were ordered to move to Prey\n",
      "Sar prison.  I think after about 10 to 20 minutes then we would\n",
      "be ordered to move further during the nighttime.\n",
      "Q. So you went to Prey Sar during the evacuation process when the\n",
      "United Front of the National Army actually liberated Phnom Penh,\n",
      "and you went along with the other people, so you were forced to\n",
      "move out with other people.  Is it correct?  I think you were\n",
      "leaving on the 7th of January 1979; is that correct?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, it's correct, we left at night in the late\n",

      "please tell us about the date during the process you were\n",

      "Road Number 4, and at dawn we saw the presence of the United\n",
      "Front army, and the guards who guarded us all the way while we\n",
      "were on our journey then left us.  And I could proceed with Pha\n",
      "Tha Chan and I did not know where the other people went to\n",
      "because Vann Nath also left us, except I and Pha Tha Chan who\n",

      "Bech and Comrade Kong, and I walked with other people until I\n",
      "reached Pursat province.  And Vietnamese troops would be seen in\n",

      "painting the portrait of Pol Pot, Him Huy was outside of the\n",

      "observation and recollection, could you please tell the Court\n",
      "about those events?\n",
      "A. During the time when I worked as a painter in Building E\n",
      "painting a portrait of Pol Pot, I could see through the window\n",
      "the sending of Vietnamese soldiers and the Khmer Rouge soldiers\n",
      "who were sent en masse into the compound.  I did not actually\n",
      "witness the torture, but I heard the screams; people crying for\n",
      "help all around the compound.  I did not see the tortures\n",
      "directly, but I did hear people crying for help.\n",
      "Q. When you were detained in the common room, did you see dead\n",
      "body of other detainees in the room and if you saw them, did you\n",
      "see them often?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I saw a dead body who was lying head to head\n",
      "with me.  He was with dark complexion, a small person.  He was\n",
      "taller than me.  He was about the same age as me.  If he would\n",
      "live, now he would be 67, 68.  A young guard stamped on his chest\n",
      "and he coughed with blood and he was lying dead there inside the\n",
      "common room.  At night, he would be taken to be buried in the\n",
      "compound not far from that.\n",
      "Q. So how long was it -- I mean, the interval between the time\n",
      "when the person died and the time when he was buried?\n",
      "A. I noticed that he was dead in the daytime and then late at\n",
      "night -- I can't remember when, but it was at night that the\n",
      "person disappeared and would be buried.  I don't know where he\n",
      "would be buried or discarded because I was still shackled and I\n",
      "didn't know more about something outside.\n",
      "Q. You were detained and shackled for a long period of time\n",
      "before you were let out to be a painter.  And have you noticed\n",
      "the people who were sent in and shackled along with you in the\n",
      "same room would be taken out and disappeared or had they returned\n",
      "or have you noticed that?\n",
      "A. I'm talking before the God, the Buddha.  I'm talking the\n",
      "truth.  People would be put into the trucks and carried away and\n",
      "they never returned.  And after being interrogated, I would be\n",
      "kept downstairs and I did not know much about the fate of those\n",
      "people, but when I was in the common room, people who would be\n",
      "taken away would never come back so they just disappeared.\n",
      "Q. What about the other situation, for example, when a detainee\n",
      "was so weak that he would be carried to the truck or to the other\n",
      "location?  Had you seen such scenes?\n",
      "A. I did witness the very thin person who were tied to his legs\n",
      "and arms, and a stick would be put to -- and then carried by two\n",
      "people.  He was carried like a pig, like people would be carrying\n",
      "a pig, and he was passing the place where I was painting, and the\n",
      "guard banged the door shut in order not to let me see them\n",
      "carrying that very sick and thin detainee.  I did not know where\n",
      "he was up to.\n",
      "Q. Were they carrying the dead body or a person who's still\n",
      "alive?\n",
      "A. He was not yet dead.  He was still breathing and then he would\n",
      "be carried onto the truck waiting outside the prison.  We could\n",
      "hear the sound of the truck coming in and out all day long.\n",
      "Q. I think you should have known about this, about the trucks\n",
      "that came and take people away all night.  Can you tell us\n",
      "whether the trucks only came during the night or during the\n",
      "daytime, or detainees would be taken by the trucks at any time\n",
      "from S-21?  I mean, those people who would be taken away and\n",
      "would never return.\n",
      "A. I was in the common cell or common room.  After being\n",
      "interrogated, I was put in the cell and I could hear the sound of\n",
      "the trucks.  I never saw the trucks; just heard the sound, the\n",
      "noise.  I did not know or see the detainees.  I only saw him once\n",
      "when I was painting the portrait of Pol Pot while they were\n",
      "carrying him, passing me.\n",
      "Q. So was it at night or during the daytime?  I'm asking this\n",
      "because after hearing testimony we have received two different\n",
      "kinds of information, especially concerning the transportation of\n",
      "detainees to Choeung Ek, because the information we obtained so\n",
      "far is that detainees would only be sent during the night.\n",
      "Another thing is that I don't know whether you're confused among\n",
      "two of you.  One witness who testified said that during the time\n",
      "he was detained at the location from the morning until 12 p.m. he\n",
      "would not be able to sleep because he wait until 12 p.m. passed\n",
      "so that he knew that no people would be carried away to be killed\n",
      "after that.  So that's why I would like you to clarify whether\n",
      "prisoners would be taken at night or in the daytime, especially\n",
      "regarding the person who was very sick and would be carried away\n",
      "by two people with a stick.  Was it done during the day or at\n",
      "night?\n",
      "A. At that time I did not see at night, of course, but I saw it\n",
      "during the daytime.  It was about 9 or 10 a.m.; I think more or\n",
      "less at about nine, between 9 and 10 a.m.\n",
      "Q. Normally when the trucks came, were the trucks driven to\n",
      "Building E or just they were parked right in front of the\n",
      "entrance; close to Building B or C, for example?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, regarding the trucks that transported the\n",
      "detainees, the truck parked outside under the gate -- I mean near\n",
      "that gate.  The truck did not come into the compound of the\n",
      "prison.  They parked outside.\n",
      "Q. Did you notice other activities of the staff at S-21 towards\n",
      "other detainees?\n",
      "A. When I was painting at Tuol Sleng, I saw female detainees.\n",
      "Some pregnant detainees would be walked away while being kicked\n",
      "by the guards -- female guards.  And they asked them to walk\n",
      "faster and they walked past Building B and then -- I mean from\n",
      "south to north, from Building A to B.  I did not know where they\n",
      "would be detained, but they passed us while we were painting the\n",
      "portraits.\n",
      "Q. The last question.  When you left with Uncle Nath and other\n",
      "survivors from S-21 on the 7th of January 1979, did you notice\n",
      "that in the buildings of S-21 there were some prisoners left?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, I think it is more about freedom of the\n",
      "prisoners.  Prisoners were deprived of their liberty and we would\n",
      "not be allowed to move, so people -- I think there was quiet\n",
      "inside.\n",
      "Q. My question is this.  I mean the last day, the last day when\n",
      "you left S-21, because there were dead bodies on the beds.  There\n",
      "were 14 of them.  Some witnesses would say that there were only\n",
      "10; the accused said that there were only four people; and now\n",
      "the survivors, including you yourself, have noticed that there\n",
      "would be some kind of noise and could see people were still left\n",
      "inside the building during the time when you were leaving the\n",
      "premises.\n",
      "The question is whether you could receive any information or see\n",
      "that detainees still were there on the 17th (sic) of January\n",
      "1979, the moment before you were leaving S-21.  So just tell us\n",
      "whether you saw people still there at the premises when you were\n",
      "leaving.\n",
      "A. Mr. President, the last day on the 7th of January I left S-21\n",
      "at about 9 a.m.  We heard the gunshots and we were ordered to\n",
      "leave immediately.  At that moment I did not see or hear any\n",
      "noise, and I was so panicked that I did not pay attention to who\n",
      "would remain, because they pointed the guns at us and they warned\n",
      "us not to even turn back.  We had to really walk forward\n",
      "otherwise we would get killed or shot.  So I did not see any one\n",
      "I guess.\n",

      "Q. Uncle Meng, when the interrogators stopped torturing you\n",
      "because you agreed to confess and it was a false confession, was\n",
      "it based on the purpose in order to satisfy the interrogators, or\n",
      "you survived because of your skill as a painter?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, regarding the torture inflicted upon me --\n",
      "after they still couldn't extract the confession from me because\n",
      "I gave the same response every day, and because I did not know\n",
      "who was the leader or who introduced me into the CIA or KGB, they\n",
      "kept beating me up every day.\n",
      "And because they could not get my confession, they took me to the\n",
      "building which is now where you can purchase the ticket to visit\n",
      "the museum.  I was asked to sit there and they wrote a false\n",
      "confession and ordered me to sign.  I can not recall the content\n",
      "of that confession, it's been so many years now, and also because\n",
      "of the serious torture inflicted upon me my memory was not good.\n",
      "And at that time, if my memory was like I am now, I would not be\n",
      "able to paint the portrait and I would not survive because during\n",
      "that time if they thought somebody lied, especially lying to\n",
      "Angkar, then that one would be dead.\n",
      "Q. During the time that they decided to use you as a painter to\n",
      "paint the portraits of the leaders, including Brother Number 1,\n",
      "Pol Pot, and other leaders including the Chinese leader as you\n",
      "stated, what happened during the times that you did the painting?\n",
      "For instance, were you detained again as a prisoner?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, no.  During the times that I did the painting I\n",
      "worked every day regularly so it took me a long time to complete\n",
      "the four portraits.  That was after I had been tortured.\n",
      "Q. Until now, can you try to remember or recall, besides the\n",
      "serious torture inflicted upon you with the present scars on your\n",
      "back until today, was the situation of receiving torture\n",
      "physically or emotionally, did it happen elsewhere?\n",
      "A. Mr. President, if you talk about my memory, I am very\n",
      "forgetful now.  My memory is not as good as when I was young.\n",
      "For example, if I leave something somewhere, sometimes I forget\n",
      "where I left it.\n",

      "JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President.\n",
      "BY JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:\n",
      "Q. Mr. Bou Meng, you were at S-21 for a very long time and you\n",
      "have described your suffering and your experiences there; thank\n",
      "you for that.  But I have just one or two small questions to ask\n",
      "you.\n",
      "I want to know something about other prisoners whom you might\n",
      "have seen at S-21.  You have talked about the people who were in\n",
      "the same room shackled as you were.  You have spoken of seeing\n",
      "some pregnant women being kicked by female guards and told to\n",
      "walk more quickly.\n",
      "Did you see any foreigners at S-21, other than the large number\n",
      "of Vietnamese soldiers that you have described?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, the inmates in the common room where I was\n",
      "detained, there were some foreigners.  I was not sure of their\n",
      "nationality, whether they were European, American or Australian.\n",
      "They were detained in the same common room as I was detained, and\n",
      "they had the same food ration as I received.\n",
      "Q. Were you aware of any foreigners other than westerners or\n",
      "Vietnamese, such as Thais, people from Thailand?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, I did not see any Thai citizens.  I only saw\n",
      "Vietnamese people and some foreigners.  They were tall, they had\n",
      "bright eyes, and sort of bronze hair.  Besides that I did not see\n",
      "any other nationality, including Thai.\n",
      "Q. In addition to the Vietnamese soldiers, whom you saw, did you\n",
      "see any ordinary Vietnamese people; that is people who were not\n",
      "soldiers?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, yes, I saw civilian people.  They were not\n",
      "soldiers.  And I saw these one civilian, as I said earlier, he\n",
      "said he knew he was a real artist, but when Duch ordered him to\n",
      "test, to make the mould and he couldn't do it, and, of course, at\n",
      "that time Angkar was not happy -- was not happy of anybody lying\n",
      "to Angkar.  And I don't have anything else to say regarding this\n",
      "question.\n",
      "Q. The people whom you think might have been westerners, and the\n",
      "ordinary Vietnamese people whom you saw, were they all treated\n",
      "the same way as you were?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, for the prisoners the treatment was not the same.\n",
      "For example, I, myself, I received very serious torture, so only\n",
      "I, myself, knew clearly about what happened to me, and I cannot\n",
      "say about what happened to other inmates.\n",
      "Q. Did you see many children at S-21?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, for children at S-21, I did not see any of them\n",
      "walking around or detained there.  I only saw those children in\n",
      "the photos, but I did not see them personally during the time of\n",
      "my detention.  This is my frank and honest response.\n",
      "Q. Did you ever hear the sounds of children around S-21?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, for the sound of children, I did not hear.  I\n",
      "only heard the screaming, asking for help of the adult people\n",
      "while I was in the common room.  And while I was in the\n",
      "individual room, individual cell, I also heard the screaming, but\n",
      "the screaming of the adult, not the children.\n",
      "JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:\n",
      "Thank you very much, Mr. Bou Meng.\n",
      "Mr. President, I have no further questions.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Judges of the Bench, do you have any questions?\n",
      "Judge Lavergne, you take the floor.\n",
      "BY JUDGE LAVERGNE:\n",
      "Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Bou Meng.\n",
      "I also have a few questions to ask you, to try to clarify what\n",
      "you already explained in detail to the Chamber earlier on today.\n",
      "I think I understood through what you said this morning, and\n",
      "through what I have read in your testimony, that your life was\n",
      "essentially impacted by many sacrifices, and by a life of\n",
      "obedience.  And you said this morning that you answered Prince\n",
      "Sihanouk's call in 1970 to free Cambodia, to liberate Cambodia.\n",
      "Is that so?\n",
      "A. At that time, I heard the appeal of the Prince Sihanouk on the\n",
      "radio broadcast.  I was not sure which broadcast was it.  He\n",
      "appealed for his children to go to the maquis forest to struggle,\n",
      "so I decided to enter the maquis forest in 1971 with another\n",
      "friend from K25 office.\n",
      "So we went to the maquis forest to make some sketches and drawing\n",
      "of Marx and Lenin.  I was the one who drew the pictures of Marx\n",
      "and Lenin.  And those sketches were stencilled and distributed to\n",
      "various units in order to understand the supreme leaders of the\n",
      "Communists -- of the Communist country.  There were five of them\n",
      "all together: Karl Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mao Zhedong.  So I even\n",
      "drew the sketches of these people on the cloth.\n",
      "Q. So you worked there for the -- at the services of the\n",
      "Communist Party of Kampuchea's propaganda.  You were very\n",
      "respectful of what you were requested to do.  And then between\n",
      "the end of your activity with the propaganda services and your\n",
      "job at the Orussei Technical School, did you do anything else\n",
      "between; was there another episode in your career?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, let me correct that.  It was called the Russei\n",
      "Keo Technical School, not Orussei Technical School.\n",
      "Q. Did you go directly from the propaganda services to the Russei\n",
      "Keo Technical School or did you do anything in between?\n",
      "A. In between that time -- in order to make it easier to\n",
      "understand, let me go back. First, I worked for the Ministry of\n",
      "Commerce, of State Commerce,  and Koy Thuon was the Prime\n",
      "Minister at the time.  I was requested to draw placards for a\n",
      "boat.  It was called Marinal Transport.  And I made some other\n",
      "placards and signs and boards for those boats and vehicles while\n",
      "I was there.\n",
      "Q. Well, back then did you trust the CPK entirely?  Were you\n",
      "somebody who was very much obedient, who would follow what you\n",
      "were being told to do?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, that was my specialty, the skills that I had.  I\n",
      "knew that the evacuation of people from Phnom Penh disappointed\n",
      "me because I struggled, I was so sick with malaria, and in the\n",
      "end I received such a suffering which is indescribable.  I felt\n",
      "so regretful for such inhumane acts of leadership which did not\n",
      "satisfy my willing -- my understanding.  I physically served them\n",
      "but emotionally I did not, although I wore black shirt, but my\n",
      "mind was not black.  I did what I was instructed, based on my\n",
      "skill.\n",
      "This is my response, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. Was there a specific moment where you might have entirely lost\n",
      "trust in the CPK?  Was there any moment when you said to yourself\n",
      "that what you might have believed in did not correspond to\n",
      "reality?\n",
      "A. I don't really understand your question.  Can you rephrase\n",
      "your question again and please try to be simplified and make it\n",
      "short?\n",
      "Q. Well, can we say that when you were working for the Russei Keo\n",
      "School and when you worked previously for the propaganda\n",
      "services, that you trusted the CPK and Angkar?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, I carry out the task based on the assignment from\n",
      "my superior, including drawing the sketches of the machines or\n",
      "for the new parts of the machines.  Everything was done based on\n",
      "the instructions from the chairman of that technical school.\n",
      "This is my response, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. You explained that your superiors at the technical school had\n",
      "been arrested and that you yourself had been sent to be\n",
      "re-educated.  At that moment, was your trust in the CPK -- was it\n",
      "-- did it change or did you still have full trust in the CPK?\n",
      "A. At that time, Your Honour, I lost my trust because my\n",
      "performance in carrying out the assignment was excellent, I did\n",
      "what I was asked, but I could not understand why I was\n",
      "transferred to be re-educated at the Ta Lei Co-operative.  I was\n",
      "disappointed and this is my frank response to you.  I no longer\n",
      "had my trust.\n",
      "Q. But, however, despite the difficult conditions in which you\n",
      "were, you continued obeying and you continued following the\n",
      "orders that were given to you.  Is that why it was particularly\n",
      "difficult for you to understand why you had been arrested by\n",
      "security cadres of the CPK?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, at that time, I myself and some other people\n",
      "totalling about 10, were transferred from the Russei Keo\n",
      "Technical School to Ta Lei Co-operative and I did not know the\n",
      "reason for the transfer.\n",
      "However, before the transfer we were instructed to make our\n",
      "biography, as I can recall, so I made my biography to the Angkar\n",
      "and about one or two months later I was transferred to the Ta Lei\n",
      "Co-operative amongst about 10 other people, including my wife.\n",
      "So we were tempered to do hard labour at the Ta Lei Co-operative.\n",
      "I did not know the reason for the transfer, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. Back then, had you heard of the security centres?  Were you\n",
      "aware, for example, of the existence of S-21 or of other security\n",
      "centres?\n",
      "A. Your Honour, regarding the security offices or the prisons, I\n",
      "did not hear anything at all during the time, however, people\n",
      "kept disappearing.  Some probably were sent for re-education or\n",
      "sent for training here and there.\n",
      "I had heard a lot about transferring of people or relocation of\n",
      "people starting from 1976, and I was wondering how come, while\n",
      "people were still working good and they were transferred\n",
      "elsewhere?  Or whether they had any plan of transforming in the\n",
      "agriculture production?  I only had doubt in my mind, however, I\n",
      "just kept doing what I was given or instructed.\n",
      "So I typed some documents that I was asked to do and I drew\n",
      "sketches for the students to study.  I could not understand their\n",
      "thinking.  They were in a higher class and I thought I belonged\n",
      "to the lower class with limited technical capability.\n",
      "Q. Can we say that you were not at all aware of having committed\n",
      "any kind of offence that you absolutely were not aware having\n",
      "betrayed the CPK, that you had absolutely no awareness of being\n",
      "part of a group of traitors?\n",
      "A. When I came I knew that there was a Minister of Propaganda,\n",
      "Mr. Ho Nim, who\n",
      "called me to draw a portrait of the embarkment structure.  And at\n",
      "that time the current king was teaching students how to perform\n",
      "the ballet dancing and then he told me to help draw a portrait of\n",
      "his father.  And he called his father the normal, ordinary\n",
      "person's language and I was surprised but I did not ask further\n",
      "questions.\n",
      "Probably they saw the picture, the photo that the king asked me\n",
      "to draw; that's why they arrested me, or not.  I'm not quite\n",
      "sure.\n",
      "Q. This morning, you also talked, at length, about the\n",
      "ill-treatment that was inflicted upon you.  You also talked about\n",
      "the physiological consequences thereof.  You also said to us that\n",
      "you still had scars.  I seem to have understood that these\n",
      "tortures led to other consequences, such as problems with your\n",
      "hearing.  Do you have other physiological conditions or\n",
      "difficulties that you may ascribe to being the consequences of\n",
      "that ill-treatment?\n",
      "A. I was slapped and I was beaten on the head; all kinds of\n",
      "tortures had been inflicted on me.  So in short, I believe that\n",
      "because I was severely tortured, that I look older than my age\n",
      "and I lose all the teeth, and I can observe that Brother Chum Mey\n",
      "still have his teeth.  And also I have had problems with hearing\n",
      "and I think this is probably the consequence of the torture.  And\n",
      "I look much older than I am and if you compare to the age, I\n",
      "think I should have not been that old if I was not tortured.\n",
      "Q. From what you can remember, do you have the feeling that the\n",
      "people interrogating you were enjoying themselves by making you\n",
      "suffer or seeing you suffer?\n",
      "A. During the time when I was being interrogated some people ate\n",
      "the jackfruit and they threw the remaining -- the peel of the\n",
      "jackfruit onto my head and I could feel like then I was perceived\n",
      "as enemy and prisoner.  I could not do anything but to let them\n",
      "do whatever they wish and they did not show any mercy towards me\n",
      "as a human being.  And whenever I recall it, I cannot hold back\n",
      "my tears.  I was so disappointed that I had devoted myself for\n",
      "the work and after all I end up being tortured.  I wished I were\n",
      "killed by the malaria in the jungle, but I think my life was\n",
      "valuable that I could survive longer to be tortured again.\n",
      "That's all, Your Honour.\n",
      "Q. When you were a painter at the workshop, do you now remember\n",
      "having been taken out of the workshop in relation to an incident?\n",
      "You were taken away from the workshop for about two weeks; do you\n",
      "remember that?  Do you remember then coming back to the workshop,\n",
      "having to say you were sorry, seek forgiveness?  Do you remember\n",
      "having been kicked?  Do you remember this episode or something\n",
      "like this, or do you not remember something like this happening\n",
      "to you?\n",
      "A. I think, through my recollection, this incident might not have\n",
      "happened.  I knew that one of my neighbours in my next room was\n",
      "taken away -- no, the guy who worked next to my school -- the\n",
      "technical school of Russei Keo.  A couple were taken or arrested.\n",
      "I don't know whether two of them or one of them was arrested but\n",
      "they both disappeared.  Then it came my turn who were transferred\n",
      "to Ta Lei Co-operative and that's what I have seen and known and\n",
      "I think my memory is not that good.  Maybe I have not fully\n",
      "recollected all the episodes, and accept my apologies for not\n",
      "being able to recall everything.  That's all.\n",
      "Q. Mr. Bou Meng, sorry, I was referring to the period when you\n",
      "were working in the workshop at S-21.  You were at the workshop\n",
      "in S-21.  During that period when you were working at S-21\n",
      "workshop, where you were working with Vann Nath and other\n",
      "artists; during that period, was there an episode the result of\n",
      "which was that you had to go and say sorry; that you had to go\n",
      "and apologize?\n",
      "A. I don't know whether the apologies were made to my colleagues\n",
      "or to the guards.  I'm not quite sure I understand the question.\n",
      "Q. Were you forced to apologize to your colleagues in the\n",
      "workshop at S-21 or to other people?  Were you, one day, shackled\n",
      "or tied up and led to go and offer apologies to either your\n",
      "colleagues or somebody else in the workshop?\n",
      "A. I cannot recall or maybe I forgot, because I never offered my\n",
      "apologies to anyone, even to my colleagues.  It is based on my\n",
      "recollection but of course I would have forgotten.  As the Khmer\n",
      "proverb says, \"The elephants with four legs would have collapsed\n",
      "sometime and the wise person would forget anyway.\"\n",
      "Q. Thank you, Mr. Bou Meng, for these responses.  I have one very\n",
      "last question for you.\n",
      "This morning you told us that the accused had talked about\n",
      "fertilizer, saying that humans could be fertilizer in the paddy\n",
      "fields.  Could you explain to us the meaning of this term,\n",
      "please?\n",
      "A.  The statement is based on the accused Kaing Guek Eav, alias\n",
      "Duch.  He said that if I could not resemble the portrait of Pol\n",
      "Pot then I would be used as the human fertilizer.\n",
      "And I didn't understand whether I would be used to produce\n",
      "fertilizer or would I be used as the fertilizer myself for the\n",
      "rice field.  That's what he asked me and I found it difficult to\n",
      "respond to him also at that moment.\n",
      "Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Bou Meng.\n",
      "JUDGE LAVERGNE:\n",
      "I have no further questions, Mr. President.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Next we would like to give the opportunity to the prosecutors to\n",
      "put questions to Uncle Bou Meng, the survivor of S-21.\n",
      "The floor is yours.\n",
      "MR. SENG BUNKHEANG:\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President.\n",
      "QUESTIONING BY THE CO-PROSECUTORS\n",
      "BY MR. SENG BUNKHEANG:\n",
      "Q. Good afternoon, Uncle Bou Meng.\n",
      "I have a few questions to be put to you.  Regarding the food\n",
      "ration, was it enough?\n",
      "A. The food ration, during the time when I was detained, was\n",
      "inadequate.  But when people were looking for someone who could\n",
      "paint and when I came out to work as the painter with Vann Nath,\n",
      "with Kong, with Pha Tha Chan and Bech, the food was adequate.\n",
      "But it was inadequate when I was still in the prison.\n",
      "And there would be other documents to support my arguments about\n",
      "this condition.  You may refer to it.  Thank you.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "When you were being detained at S-21 in the common room and in\n",
      "the individual cell, you said that the food ration was\n",
      "inadequate.  How could you fulfil your hunger?\n",
      "A. There was no substitute.  I was so hungry.  When I saw the\n",
      "lizard crawling on the ceiling I would wish that it dropped down\n",
      "so that I could grab it and eat to fulfil my hunger.  I told\n",
      "myself that I did not know what kind of bad deeds I committed\n",
      "previously that I would be treated like this without enough food,\n",
      "without enough water, and I was questioning myself and I was\n",
      "asking myself what kind of mistakes I had committed that I would\n",
      "end up being here.\n",
      "And I was thinking of karma and I did not even recall any\n",
      "mistakes.  But then Angkar would say that Angkar had multiple\n",
      "eyes like the pineapple so they never made any wrong arrests.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "Have you ever seen or known that at S-21 the practice of blood\n",
      "drawing took place -- I mean blood drawing from detainees?\n",

      "QUESTIONING BY CIVIL PARTY COUNSEL\n",
      "BY MR. KONG PISEY:\n",
      "Q. Good afternoon, Uncle Bou Meng.  My first question is the\n",
      "follow-up question concerning the earlobes, your earlobes.  You\n",
      "said that you received tortures onto the earlobes -- no, the ears\n",
      "as a whole, and you said you had a hearing problem.\n",
      "I would like to ask whether now you can listen to people and your\n",
      "ears are okay, or you need a hearing aid to assist you with the\n",
      "hearing?\n",
      "A. The Court officials have helped me and taken me to the\n",
      "hospital specializing in hearing and then they offered me a\n",
      "hearing aid.  I now can hear better.  If I use my bare ears to\n",
      "listen to people talking I would not be able to listen or to\n",
      "understand their conversation unless I paid very close attention,\n",
      "or move very close to them.  So if I could put number one to 10,\n",
      "I could hear about 30 percent.  I mean three out of 10 because of\n",
      "my impairment.  And I think my eyesight were not good.  My teeth,\n",
      "also, are not good.\n",
      "Of course, when people get old, this kind of thing will get old\n",
      "as well, but you know, like, Chum Mey is still young, and I am\n",
      "older than my age because I had been tortured, otherwise I would\n",
      "be ok now.  And my ears would have not been that bad.  So here --\n",
      "I can sit here, I cannot even listen to you if you talked over\n",
      "there.\n",
      "Q.   Thank you.  My next question.\n",
      "I want to know about your suffering.  How long had you endured\n",
      "this suffering or you still feel the suffering at the present\n",
      "time?\n",
      "A. Are you talking about the suffering, the physical suffering,\n",
      "in addition to the emotional suffering?\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  I meant regarding your earache.  So you suffered\n",
      "when they tortured you.  Are your ears in a better condition now?\n",
      "A. They are fully recovered, however, I have had hard hearing.\n",
      "So that's why I need the hearing aid so that I could hear\n",
      "properly.  Without the hearing aid, I could hardly hear anything.\n",
      "That's all.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  Regarding the electrocution, as you stated that\n",
      "they used the wall power outlet to electrocute you.  You said you\n",
      "were electrocuted near your genitals.  How far was the spot where\n",
      "it was electrocuted?\n",
      "A. It was to the inner side of my thigh.  So once I was\n",
      "electrocuted, I fell unconscious immediately, and when I gained\n",
      "my consciousness, the water was everywhere on my face.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  Did they place the wire on your pants or on your\n",
      "flesh directly?\n",
      "A.  It was placed on my shorts, however, there was a machine that\n",
      "I think it controlled the voltage, and that machine hooked into\n",
      "the power outlet from the wall.  So I think they could increase\n",
      "the voltage from that machine.\n",
      "But you could easily understand that if the voltage was not\n",
      "strong enough, then I would not fall unconscious.  That's it.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  You already informed the Chamber that once you\n",
      "were electrocuted, you fell unconscious straight away.  And for\n",
      "how long did you become unconscious?\n",
      "A. If you are unconscious, it's like you were sleeping.  You\n",
      "would not know how long you fell unconscious.\n",
      "Q. On another matter, did you go and make consultation with the\n",
      "psychological support?\n",
      "A. Previously, I have had consultation with a psychological\n",
      "support.  I was assisted with some tablets so that I would not\n",
      "have insomnia, and I take two types of tablets on a daily basis.\n",
      "But when I come to the Court and speak in this current condition,\n",
      "I can't not even eat my lunch today because I was overwhelmed and\n",
      "I did not feel like eating anything.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  Now, on the matter of interrogation, you stated to\n",
      "the Chamber that there were five interrogators: Hor, Chan, Tith,\n",
      "Peng and Kuy, but you haven't clearly verified that for each\n",
      "interrogation, were the five present and beating you up or were\n",
      "you interrogated and tortured by only one interrogator at a time?\n",
      "A.   They were there during the interrogation, but only one\n",
      "person beat me at a time and then they took turns.  First Chan\n",
      "beat me up.  He asked me to count the number of lashes.  When I\n",
      "counted up to 10 I told him, and he said, \"It's not yet 10, I\n",
      "only hit you once\".  And I can remember his word.  I remember his\n",
      "words, I remember his face.\n",
      "I can always remember his face, the person who mistreated me.  I\n",
      "remember both, those who did good thing and who did bad things to\n",
      "me.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  The question is, on one day during the\n",
      "interrogation, were the five interrogators beat you up on that\n",
      "same day or only they came on another day?\n",
      "A. That group of interrogators, the five of them, they took turns\n",
      "to beat me up until all the five became exhausted or when the\n",
      "time was up.  For example, from 7 a.m. until about 11 or 12, then\n",
      "they rested.  I saw all of them.\n",
      "Q. So from what I can understand, you confirmed that in -- for\n",
      "each date, the five of them present at the same time.  Is that\n",
      "true?\n",
      "A. That is correct.\n",
      "Q. My next question.  You stated to the Chamber that when they\n",
      "water-hosed you in the common room, so all the inmates had to\n",
      "take off their clothes, and later on they had to dry the floor\n",
      "with their shorts.\n",
      "The question is, did the guards order the prisoners to take off\n",
      "their shorts or the prisoners took off their shorts by\n",
      "themselves?\n",
      "A. I am not sure on this point.  My memory is not clear.  I can\n",
      "remember that all of us, 30 or 40 of us, were all naked, and I\n",
      "even remember one phrase.  The person was about 15 or 16 years\n",
      "old.  He said, \"You, you have a small build but with big\n",
      "genital\".  That's what he said.  \"And this guy, you're big, but\n",
      "your penis is tiny\".  That's what he said.  So they just make a\n",
      "joke out of us being naked.  And I still can remember what was\n",
      "said, but I can not say for sure whether we took off the pants by\n",
      "ourselves or they ordered us to take the pants off.  I'm not sure\n",
      "because probably they ordered us to take the pants off so they\n",
      "can joke about our genitals.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "So for every time you were water-hosed, were all of you had to be\n",
      "naked?\n",
      "A. Yes, we all had to be naked.  I looked around.  Nobody had\n",
      "underwear or pants on them.  People were like animals from hell,\n",
      "all naked.  Because they treated us as enemies, as traitors, they\n",
      "water-hosed us from outside so the water was everywhere in the\n",
      "common room.  So then we tried to dry the floor with our pants\n",
      "until the floor was completely dry.  Then we could lie down on\n",
      "the floor again.\n",
      "And we all of us had skin rashes and a lot of skin lice.  It was\n",
      "so itchy everywhere.  I think it was Nhem En (phonetic) who\n",
      "wanted to find a cure, a treatment for skin rash and itch, and\n",
      "after that it was better.  Let me say, only the guards who could\n",
      "able to find that traditional medicines to help us with the\n",
      "itches and the skin rash.\n",
      "Q. So when you were water-hosed, were you provided any soap?\n",
      "A. No, there was no soap or nothing to scrub our body.  We were\n",
      "washed like pigs were washed.  Because I used to raise pigs, when\n",
      "I washed my pigs, then I water-hosed my pigs and I used my hands\n",
      "to clean my pigs.  But I was even lower than my pigs or my dog\n",
      "because no soap was used, no scarf was used to change or dry my\n",
      "body.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "Regarding the common room, did you ever see the prisoners who\n",
      "were taken out and when they returned, did you see any wound or\n",
      "marks on their bodies?\n",
      "A. It seems that I did not see such incidents.  I was not sure.\n",
      "Because maybe they were in the same way like I was there, it\n",
      "means after the interrogation and the torture, they would be\n",
      "taken to the individual cells so that those in the common room\n",
      "would not know that we were being tortured.\n",

      "which direction?\n",
      "A. Mr. Lawyer, when I looked to the east direction, the canvas\n",
      "was propped against the window and through the door, I could see\n",
      "a pregnant woman being walked and kicked and I did not look for\n",
      "long.  I did not know whether that pregnant woman fell on the\n",

      "did you see?\n",

      "A. Miss Lawyer, I am really not clear on the total period of\n",
      "being interrogated; however, it was several months or several\n",
      "weeks, I think.  But being detained there from when I was healthy\n",
      "until I was so skinny; it was quite a long time.\n",
      "It was common when we still had full strengths, but once we\n",
      "became weak they would start to peel our skin.  That expression\n",

      "day and night.  When you heard the sound of the vehicles, was it\n",
      "from the east or from the west entrance?  Please can you try to\n",
      "recall?  It's okay if you cannot remember.\n",
      "A. From my recollection, although I must admit I am forgetful, it\n",

      "screaming of the prisoners at S-21.  When you heard such\n",
      "screaming, was the accused, the prison chief, was there with you?\n",
      "A. While I was sleeping in Building C on the third floor in the\n",
      "common room, at night I heard the screaming.  I think probably\n",
      "the screaming was a result of the person being interrogated and\n",
      "tortured.\n",
      "To me it seems the screaming was echoing and coming from\n",
      "everywhere at the surrounding vicinity of Tuol Sleng prison,\n",
      "probably because during that time those houses around Tuol Sleng\n",
      "were used as the interrogation houses.\n",
      "But now all those houses are gone, even the house where I was\n",
      "interrogated behind Building A outside the compound also\n",
      "disappears now.  I could not recognize it any more.  That's all.\n",

      "MS. JACQUIN:\n",
      "Good afternoon, Your Honours.\n",
      "BY MS. JACQUIN:\n",
      "Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Bou Meng.  These are my questions to you.\n",
      "First of all, you stated that in the common room there were\n",
      "foreign prisoners or people who looked foreign, westerners.  Were\n",
      "they taken away while you were still in that room or were they\n",
      "still in that room at the time when you were taken away from that\n",
      "room?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, when I saw them they were westerners or we say\n",
      "Europeans.  They had light complexion and blond hair.  Of course\n",
      "I did not know their nationality.  I saw them for only a short\n",
      "period of time and then they disappeared.  They were there for\n",
      "probably two weeks being detained on that floor of Building C.\n",
      "So after about two weeks they disappeared and I didn't know where\n",
      "they were taken to.  That's all.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.\n",
      "You stated that you saw Vietnamese soldiers in uniform;\n",
      "consequently, you were quite sure that they were indeed\n",
      "Vietnamese soldiers, beyond doubt.\n",
      "A. Let me tell you, Ms. Lawyer, those Vietnamese soldiers,\n",
      "because they wore a different uniform, military uniform,\n",
      "different from the Khmer Rouge military uniforms, that uniform\n",
      "was similar to the Chinese soldier uniform.  They had a khaki\n",
      "colour and they had their rank displayed and they wore the type\n",
      "of helmet.  That's what led to my conclusion.  That's all.\n",
      "Q. I'm asking this question because there seems to be something\n",
      "ambiguous in your response unless I have misunderstood.\n",
      "Would these Vietnamese soldiers have been soldiers who retained\n",
      "their uniforms, or were these Vietnamese soldiers partners of the\n",
      "Khmer Rouge as guards and organizers of the prison?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, it is my personal view that they were real\n",
      "soldiers, they were not fake.  So it was the real military\n",
      "uniform, although some uniforms were rather old.  That is all.\n",
      "Q. So you confirm that those soldiers did not have a status of\n",
      "prisoners?\n",
      "A. I was wondering, for example, like when Kaing Guek Eav, alias\n",
      "Duch, said when you were sent there you would be treated as the\n",
      "enemy regardless you were civilians or soldiers, you were all\n",
      "regarded as the enemy.\n",
      "Q. Furthermore, you have stated that you saw a number of guards\n",
      "who were 15 or 16 years old.  They were mere teenagers.  Have you\n",
      "seen guards who were younger than that still, who would have\n",
      "been, let's say, 10 or 12 years old?\n",
      "A. I did not see any guards who were 15 or under, unless I was\n",
      "mistaken.  Usually they were 15 or above.  That was through my\n",
      "observation at the time.  That's all.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  And I have two personal questions for you now.\n",
      "Do you feel bad about having signed the confession that you had\n",
      "to sign because of duress, whereas you knew that this confession,\n",
      "the content of it, was false?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, at that time my emotion was mixed.  I was fearful,\n",
      "worried; I could not describe the emotion.  So I just did what I\n",
      "was ordered to do because there was absolutely no reason for them\n",
      "to suspect me to be a CIA or KGB agent, and I was tortured\n",
      "enough.\n",
      "Some prisoners, when they were tortured and interrogated, they\n",
      "confessed and finally they were taken and smashed, but for me I\n",
      "was different.  Of course physically I signed the confession but\n",
      "inside my heart I of course did not approve the confession.\n",
      "Q. I'm sure nobody would challenge that, sir.\n",
      "Another question.  Within the workshop amongst the sculptors,\n",
      "painters, artists would you amongst yourselves talk at all about\n",
      "the tortures that you had been subjected to and the confessions\n",
      "that you were forced to sign?  Did you talk about these things\n",
      "amongst yourselves within the workshop?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, I never talked about that.  The reason is because\n",
      "I was scared.  Usually there were two or three prison guards who\n",
      "were there constantly and the door was locked both inside and\n",
      "outside, so if we whispered or chit-chatted on this thing then\n",
      "it's so risky.\n",
      "Q. One last question.  Today how do you feel about the fact that\n",
      "you are a survivor?\n",
      "A. Ms. Lawyer, I am so delighted that now my chest seems to be\n",
      "lighter.  All my statements to the Judges and to the lawyers and\n",
      "the rest, I felt much better now and I believed through peace and\n",
      "justice would be done for those 1.8 or two million people who\n",
      "lost their lives during that regime, and I myself too, I was a\n",
      "victim and the scope of suffering was incalculable.  I was almost\n",
      "killed.  My back was wounded severely and still I could carry out\n",
      "my profession, painting the portraits to satisfy the chief of the\n",
      "prison.\n",
      "But it was shameful that I could not save the life of my wife.\n",
      "I'm not sure if it was my mistake or not and I really want to ask\n",
      "the accused where was my wife killed.  If I know where it is then\n",
      "I would go there in order to pray for her soul, and that I am now\n",
      "being testified before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Court of\n",
      "Cambodia, only the spirit of the earth would know where the soul\n",
      "has gone to or where the dead bodies were buried.  So only the\n",
      "spirits of the wind, of the water, of the earth would know.\n",
      "And for those who killed the people, they could tell the truth or\n",
      "they could lie, but only the spirits of the earth, the wind and\n",
      "the water know where my wife died, so that I could pray for her\n",
      "soul.  That is all.\n",
      "MS. JACQUIN:\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. Bou Meng.\n",
      "Mr. President, on behalf of all the civil party groups, we have a\n",
      "request to put to you.  We would like to ask for 10 extra\n",
      "minutes.  There are seven lawyers present here representing 90\n",
      "victims.  All of these victims are important.  If we are to share\n",
      "out this time it would amount to one half-minute per victim, but\n",
      "we have legitimate questions to put.\n",
      "Sir, you have been showing tolerance in interpreting the time\n",
      "allowance and we are grateful for this.  However, we have all\n",
      "sorts of time management problems.  If you could assure us that\n",

      "In order not to complicate the matter regarding the request by\n",
      "both sides and the civil party lawyers use the time as allocated\n",
      "by the Chamber, however, the Chamber will not allow extra time\n",
      "and the time has run out already.\n",
      "Now I would give the opportunity to the survivor, Bou Meng.\n",
      "Uncle Bou Meng, do you have any questions that you would like to\n",
      "ask the accused at the moment?\n",
      "MR. BOU MENG:\n",
      "Mr. President, I would like to ask him where did he smash my\n",
      "wife; whether it was at Tuol Sleng or Choeung Ek or at another\n",
      "location.\n",
      "Did you have the authority to relocate her or to smash her?  It\n",
      "has been so many years already.  I went to her native village in\n",
      "Tboung Khmum district in Kampong Cham province.   I went to ask\n",
      "her elder sibling whether my wife has ever returned to the\n",
      "village and the response was no.  So I presumed that she was\n",
      "killed while she was detained.\n",
      "And my question is just to tell me, just to tell me where she was\n",
      "killed or smashed.  Then I would go to that location and just to\n",
      "get the soil from that location to pray for her soul because\n",
      "there was not her document at the S-21 Office.  I used to have\n",
      "some documents as well, but some of the documents I have I have\n",
      "lost or are missing.  And I want the matter to be done legally.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Can you verify that your wife, who was detained at S-21 with you,\n",
      "her name was Ma Yoeun alias Thy.  Is that correct?\n",
      "MR. BOU MENG:\n",
      "That is correct, Mr. President.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "Mr. Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, the first question is, do you\n",
      "know Ma Yoeun alias Thy?  If you know her, could you answer to\n",
      "his question that when you were the chairman of S-21 and that his\n",
      "wife was taken away to be executed, where was she killed?  In\n",
      "Phnom Penh or at Choeung Ek?\n",
      "THE ACCUSED:\n",
      "Mr. President, thank you, Mr. President for giving me the\n",
      "opportunity to respond to the question.\n",
      "Mr. Meng, especially for you I have been moved.  We have lived\n",
      "together and you were healthy and I was shocked to see you on the\n",
      "28th of February 2008 before the Co-Investigating Judges.  I\n",
      "would like to respond to your desire, but it was beyond my\n",
      "capacity because this work done by my subordinates, but I would\n",
      "like to presume that your wife might have been killed at Boeng\n",
      "Choeung Ek.\n",
      "Meanwhile, to be sure, I would like to ask you to please ask\n",
      "Comrade Huy who may be able to tell you further detail about the\n",
      "fate of your wife.  Please accept my highest assurance of my\n",
      "regards and respects towards the soul of your wife.  That's all.\n",
      "MR. PRESIDENT:\n",
      "The accused, please control your emotion and re-compose because\n",
      "the moment is important that it takes time to listen to the\n",
      "testimony of the survivors who have survived the regime and to\n",
      "recall the past.\n",
      "So, Uncle Bou Meng, I hope you have already been told by the\n",
      "accused about the fate of your wife because his conclusion is\n",
      "that she could have been killed at Boeng Choeung Ek, especially\n",
      "when it comes to the time when she was sent in during the year of\n",
      "1977.\n",
      "At the beginning, the killing would take place only at the\n",
      "premises of Tuol Sleng compound and later on, after 1977 to '78,\n",
      "then the execution sites had been shifted to Choeung Ek.  So it\n",
      "could be possible that the fate of your wife would be ended there\n",
      "at Choeung Ek or she would be killed there.\n",
      "And to get further information, it is rather difficult because\n",
      "the people who perished amounted to more than 12,000, and those\n",
      "more than 12,000 were registered and there were still numbers of\n",
      "detainees who are still unaccounted for.  At the beginning, we\n",
      "know that there would have been 12,300 or something detainees,\n",
      "but after inspecting the list and compared with other lists, then\n",
      "we could see more numbers, different numbers of the people killed\n",
      "during that time.  But I think the actual number of people who\n",
      "would have been killed would be even higher if all documents\n",
      "could be supported.\n",
      "Next, the accused, besides your response to Uncle Bou Meng, one\n",
      "of the survivors who asked you about the fate of his wife, the\n",
      "Chamber would like to also know whether the accused would like to\n",
      "make any comments or observations, testimony, concerning the\n",

      "THE ACCUSED:\n",
      "Mr. President, first, I would like to confirm to Mr. Bou Meng and\n",
      "the other victims.  He keep asking what kind of mistakes he had\n",
      "committed; what kind of mistake his wife committed that led to\n",
      "their arrest.\n",
      "Frankly, during that time, I already -- I think yesterday I told\n",

      "out as the CIA, the KGB, or the expansionist, so on and so forth.\n",
      "So I would like just to repeat it and to be more precise.\n",
      "I would like to state that the Cultural Revolution of China would\n",
      "be seen as the reference.  Although Pol Pot did not follow\n",
      "exactly that kind of philosophy, he used his own improvised\n",
      "theory, so he would implicate anyone as an enemy.\n",
      "And I told Brother Mey already about the CIA.  He asked me\n",

      "defeated the Pol Pot regime.\n",

      "emphasize again that this crime is so severe, although it was\n",
      "committed by the upper echelon.  But members of the Party were\n",
      "part of the process all across the country, because more than one\n",
      "million people were executed, and emotionally I am responsible\n",
      "for all the crimes, although they were committed by the senior\n",

      "BY MR. KAR SAVUTH:\n",
      "Q. When you were detained at S-21 did you hear the cries, the\n",
      "weeps or screams of people in the compound?  Because this\n",
      "morning, before we adjourned for lunch, you said that there were\n",
      "full -- everyone was quiet and people could not even whisper to\n",
      "one another.  So I think your testimony in the morning seems to\n",
      "be contradictory to your testimony in the afternoon.  Could you\n",
      "please repeat or confirm your both testimonies?\n",
      "A. I said it was very quiet because the doors were all shut when\n",
      "I left, evacuated.  I did not have a chance to look inside the\n",
      "rooms because I were at -- I was walked away at gunpoint and I\n",
      "was not brave enough to even look back to see how many people\n",
      "would be in the room.  That's why I said it was quiet.\n",
      "And I think regarding the screams, the cries, I knew that my ears\n",
      "were too good to listen to those noises because I was also a very\n",
      "good artist.  Having heard the sound, I could even draft or\n",
      "sketch a kind of portrait, so I think I was not mistaken to hear\n",
      "those screams during the time when I was detained.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  Could you please emphasize again: you said that\n",
      "before the morning break, you said that the building was full of\n",
      "people.  And you said that the building was full of detainees but\n",
      "it was so quiet because people could not even whisper into the\n",
      "ears of the neighbours.  But how could you say that you heard the\n",
      "screams, the cries that people cried for help?  I don't want you\n",
      "to tell us about the time when you were about to leave S-21.\n",
      "A. I would like to state that when I was inside the detention\n",
      "centre, around the compound there were a lot of interrogating\n",
      "houses.  And inside the room, of course, you could not hear\n",
      "anyone scream or cry because we would be punished.  But I'm\n",
      "talking about the people who would be taken away to be\n",
      "interrogated inside those houses, and we could hear from the\n",
      "houses.  I'm not here to talk and to implicate anyone.  I'm\n",
      "talking here, right before the iron genie, and if I talked\n",
      "something, exaggerating anything, then I would be run over by a\n",
      "bus.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  I would like you to only confirm.  Number two, I\n",
      "would like your confirmation also.  You said the subordinates of\n",
      "Duch, who treated the Vietnamese prisoner who did not keep his\n",
      "promise that he was a sculptor, and that you said Duch ordered\n",
      "his subordinate to kick or to torture him but later on you said\n",
      "that Duch was not there when his subordinates tortured him.  So\n",
      "could you please tell us whether Duch was there when the torture\n",
      "took place?\n",

      "want to evade any responses but if I made any mistake in my\n",
      "testimony it is resulted from the very poor memory of mine;\n",
      "resulted, of course, from such torture.  So I think my memory is\n",
      "now about\n",
      "to 20 percent good, compared to the 100 percent I           10   could have had previously.\n",

      "Q. Uncle Meng, could you please control your emotion?  I know\n",
      "that you have been bombarded with questions, and you have been\n",
      "answering to those questions for almost the whole day already.\n",
      "We would like you to please recompose yourself.\n",
      "And the question is implied as, have you heard that Duch ordered\n",
      "his subordinates to beat the Vietnamese detainee?  And some said\n",
      "that he was the Khmer Krom national who pretended to be a good\n",
      "sculptor.  So the question is whether Duch did order such torture\n",
      "or punishment to be inflicted on that person, or Duch\n",
      "subordinates initiated such ideas of punishment spontaneously,\n",
      "because there was a torture inflicted on that person; so whether\n",
      "it was ordered or not ordered by Duch.  Could you please verify?\n",
      "A. I did not see or hear it.  That's why I cannot presume that he\n",
      "ordered his subordinates to do that.  Or maybe his subordinates\n",
      "just did that by themselves.  I can say that without any order\n",
      "from their subordinates I don't even think that their\n",
      "subordinates could inflict any kind of tortures on them - on\n",
      "anyone.  So I could see that, after their work, they covered --\n",
      "you know, like, when they treated their staff, they would cover\n",
      "the blankets all over their body and walk them away because they\n",
      "were afraid to let us know.  I don't know, but I think it is just\n",
      "my presumption.\n",
      "Q. I think you probably be confused.  You are the survivor of\n",
      "that regime and that it is,\n",
      "of course, in your testimony reflecting your emotion and your\n",
      "story and how you have suffered and, also, you have told us about\n",

      "your testimony concerning the accused because a witness is not\n",
      "supposed to give a kind of presumption because it is not really\n",
      "appropriate.  Because in the name of the witness, if the question\n",
      "is put to you whether you say that you saw it or you didn't see\n",
      "it, you should just say \"yes\" or \"no\" and please try to avoid\n",

      "because the term \"conclusion\" is not aimed to be coming from the\n",
      "witness.\n",

      "Q. Thank you, Mr. Bou Meng.\n",
      "The third question.  When you were arrested all together with\n",
      "your wife from the cooperative to be put at wooden shed right in\n",
      "front of the prison, were you shackled by your ankles?\n",
      "A. At that time, they treated me better because they used the\n",
      "very cold method because there were no cuffs, no chain, no\n",
      "shackles.  They mislead me. They lied to me because they did not\n",
      "actually take me to the Fine Arts School.  It was the fine arts\n",
      "school of Tuol Sleng prison, so they cheated on me.  I could just\n",
      "easily be convinced to climb onto the truck and then be taken\n",
      "away and then they did not take me to the Fine Arts School.\n",
      "Instead, we were taken to the prison.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  The reason I asked you that question to confirm\n",
      "your statement because your statement before the Co-Prosecutor on\n",
      "the 29 of August 2006 in ERN-00145528, you said you were\n",
      "handcuffed and shackles; both your wife and you.  And this\n",
      "morning, you said that only your hands were cuffed and that your\n",
      "legs were free from being shackled.\n",
      "And as you said, you are old and you had been tortured; your\n",
      "memory deteriorating.  I think everyone can forget except the God\n",
      "who is able to remember everything.  Human being will be\n",
      "forgetful anyway.  Thank you.\n",
      "Question number four.  Your statement before the Co-Prosecutors\n",
      "-- and you said later, \"I learned that I was taken -- prisoners\n",
      "were taken to be executed at Choeung Ek, days and nights\".  Do\n",
      "you maintain that your statement is still confirmed?\n",
      "A. Mr. Lawyer, I did say that there were trucks which brought\n",
      "people in and out, but I\n",
      "did not say that they would be taken away to be killed.  I didn't\n",
      "say that.\n",

      "That's why I am asking whether you maintain your statement or\n",
      "would you like to change it because some witnesses said that they\n",
      "only saw the prisoner being carried away by trucks at night, not\n",
      "during the daytimes.  Thank you.\n",
      "A. When I was detained in Building C, I heard the sound of the\n",
      "trucks during the\n",
      "nights and days.  I don't know whatever other people would\n",
      "testify, but this is what I have heard because there were trucks\n",
      "coming in and going out.  I don't know where people would be\n",
      "taken to, but I have heard the noises.  I did not see the trucks.\n",
      "I think the trucks would have been parked right in front of the\n",

      "I had been working at the premises for some time.  I still cannot\n",

      "When leaving S-21, did you go with Vann Nath and Chum Mey or did\n",
      "you go with other people?  Could you please recall the people?\n",
      "A. We left with the survivors who were either sculptor, painter,\n",
      "artist. I paint a black and white portrait while Nath paints\n",
      "coloured, and we have other artists who also left at that time --\n",
      "Pha Tha Chan, Oeng Bech -- so altogether about more than 10\n",
      "people who would be leaving the location but many of whom have\n",
      "died already, including Grandfather Thuon.\n",
      "So I, of course, left with several other people and when we\n",
      "reached the area near Ang Snuol we departed, were separated\n",
      "because we heard the sound of the trucks of the United Front army\n",
      "and then there were exchanges of fire between the soldiers, and\n",
      "then we were scattered and I walked across National Road Number\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  I just want to know when you left, you left along\n",

      "morning you said when you fled S-21, one time you said it was at\n",
      "6 p.m. and the other time you said at 9 a.m.  And when Ty Srinna\n",
      "asked you, you said you went at about 6 or 7 p.m.  So can you\n",
      "tell me exactly what time you left S-21?\n",
      "A. Mr. Defence Counsel, I left Tuol Sleng prison at 9 o'clock.\n",
      "We left the painting workshop and we were ordered to walk\n",
      "straight in one line.  We were so fearful, so we walked in one\n",
      "line and when we reached a house we stopped and stayed there for\n",
      "quite a while.  I cannot recall the location.  Maybe it's the\n",
      "Beehive radio station.\n",
      "Q. I just want to know the time.  So you say now it's at 9\n",
      "o'clock in the morning.\n",
      "And my seventh question, which is the last question; when you\n",
      "were painting the portrait did you ever see Khieu Samphan coming\n",
      "to visit?\n",
      "A. Mr. Defence Counsel, I never saw Khieu Samphan come in.  All\n",
      "those senior peoples, I never saw them.  Even Pol Pot, I only saw\n",
      "his photo; I never saw him in person.  Sometimes people ask\n",
      "whether I saw Pol Pot personally because I painted his portrait.\n",
      "In fact I never saw him in person.  I also had my portrait\n",
      "painted for a Chinese shop in Shanghai.\n",
      "Q. Thank you.  So when you painted the portrait at the technical\n",
      "school did Khieu Samphan ever go there?\n",
      "A. Mr. Defence Counsel, I can recall when you ask me that\n",
      "question because I worked there.  At that time I was preparing\n",
      "the numbers of the pages and Mr. Khieu Samphan asked me, \"Do you\n",
      "have a telephone?\" and then I told him and I pointed -- oh, the\n",
      "telephone was at the corner, because I didn't know that he was\n",
      "Khieu Samphan.  But when he left, my work colleague told me that,\n",
      "\"That was Khieu Samphan,\" and I felt rather surprised.  So now I\n",

      "BY MS. CANIZARES:\n",
      "Q. Good evening, Mr. Bou Meng.  Judge Lavergne brought up earlier\n",
      "on the fact that when you were working in the CPK propaganda\n",
      "service, which was at the Russei Keo, you were somebody who was\n",
      "very obedient.  And if I've understood correctly, you indicated\n",
      "that you followed along physically but not emotionally.  Could\n",
      "you please develop this assertion, this idea?\n",
      "A. Ms. Defence Counsel, the work that was assigned to me by Hak\n",
      "to draw sketches of the machines, of the half a machine or of the\n",
      "new spare parts, or the sketches of vehicle machines, all types\n",
      "of machinery, I drew all those sketches to include in the book\n",
      "for the students to study at that time.\n",
      "My recollection in making that document for those technical\n",
      "school participants, that was what I did.  Of course I obeyed the\n",
      "order from the upper echelon and my superior, Hak, assigned me to\n",
      "make or compile those documents.  That is all my answer.\n",
      "Q. Could you please tell us why emotionally you said that you\n",
      "didn't follow along?  I understood that you were just obeying to\n",
      "an order, so therefore of course you were obeying physically, we\n",
      "could say, but why do you state that you did not obey\n",
      "emotionally?\n",
      "A. On this matter let me tell you, Ms. Defence Counsel,\n",
      "physically I followed the assignment and, as my skill was in\n",
      "drawing sketches, I just did it.  But in my mind I did not have\n",
      "100 percent confidence and trust in the leadership, and the\n",
      "reason?  Because I saw people being evacuated from the city, and\n",
      "the city became like a ghost city.  And this is my response to\n",
      "you.\n",
      "Q. This will be my last question.  So why, therefore, did you\n",
      "continue obeying physically?\n",
      "A. Ms. Defence Counsel, regarding my assignment as a painter or a\n",
      "sketch drawer, I had to do it.  I had to carry out my task and\n",
      "even if I completed and carried out my task 100 percent, I was\n",
      "still being transferred.\n",
      "So I was transferred to the Ta Lei Co-operative and that act made\n",
      "me lost my trust in that regime.\n",
      "Q. Given the answer, would you please give me the leave for\n",
      "another question?  Therefore, could I understand that it was\n",
      "because you were afraid that you continued obeying physically?\n",
      "A. I don't really understand your question.  Can you ask the\n",
      "question again?\n",
      "Q. You are telling us that if you did not follow the orders 100\n",
      "percent that were given to you that you could be transferred.  So\n",
      "therefore can I conclude from this answer that it was fear that\n",
      "made you follow 100 percent the orders that were given to you?\n",
      "A. In fact, that was the case.\n",
