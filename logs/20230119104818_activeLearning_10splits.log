In 1973 they did not yet assign the cooperative but the products or rice was under the supervision of the chief of the village or sub-districts.  And in the M-13 office we did not have any hammock for a person like Chan Voeun.  How could Chan Voeun have a hammock to exchange for something; that was a lie.  How could I assign somebody that's Soy in the economic unit, I did not know this person; there was no name of Soy or Chan Voeun as staff of the M-13 office. So, because he's not a member of the M-13 he fabricated a number of points.  And on the point of shooting a detainee that is true but it was not Soy but the name was Yoeu. And when he spoke about the Amleang people, there were 70 plus of them, I could think of -- about those people, I could recall about 20 plus of their names and he said two of them survived, that is true. Those two were asked by the upper echelon not to charge them and we thought they were twins but later on when the truck went to Pursat I allowed the mother and the twins and probably Son as well, to go to Pursat, that's true. So he mixed both the facts and fiction in his testimony.

As for -- I tried to raise three children from their mother, but I could not do that, but they were not from Amleang. As for the flood, I would like to tell you the truth as the following.  A flood from the mountainous area, I had explained to the Chambers earlier that that day there was a slight rain at the place about 9:00 a.m. in the morning.  It was not a heavy rain that day, but there was flood that's about one metre in height in one hour.  It's very quick.  I saw that.  Then I stand -- I stood next to the pits and I told them, "Come out, come out" including myself and others would catch the bin and water above my chest. Everybody was in the same situation. In the evening, about 3:00 p.m., then the water level went down. At that time, I rescued the prisoner and the guards to Chot's house.  It's the village chief of the Trapeang Traob village. And therefore there was no prisoner died in the flood there.  As I told Your Honours earlier, no one died in the flood.  No one climbed up into the tree.  And there was a small hill next to Chot's house.  Chot was the chief of the village and at that time we cross... we could not cross to the house of Brother Chot because there was a pond there.  And before the person did not see anything and come to testify at the court, we cannot say it is correct.

As for -- I tried to raise three children from their mother, but I could not do that, but they were not from Amleang. As for the flood, I would like to tell you the truth as the following.  A flood from the mountainous area, I had explained to the Chambers earlier that that day there was a slight rain at the place about 9:00 a.m. in the morning.  It was not a heavy rain that day, but there was flood that's about one metre in height in one hour.  It's very quick.  I saw that.  Then I stand -- I stood next to the pits and I told them, "Come out, come out" including myself and others would catch the bin and water above my chest. Everybody was in the same situation. In the evening, about 3:00 p.m., then the water level went down. At that time, I rescued the prisoner and the guards to Chot's house.  It's the village chief of the Trapeang Traob village. And therefore there was no prisoner died in the flood there.  As I told Your Honours earlier, no one died in the flood.  No one climbed up into the tree.  And there was a small hill next to Chot's house.  Chot was the chief of the village and at that time we cross... we could not cross to the house of Brother Chot because there was a pond there.  And before the person did not see anything and come to testify at the court, we cannot say it is correct.

As for -- I tried to raise three children from their mother, but I could not do that, but they were not from Amleang. As for the flood, I would like to tell you the truth as the following.  A flood from the mountainous area, I had explained to the Chambers earlier that that day there was a slight rain at the place about 9:00 a.m. in the morning.  It was not a heavy rain that day, but there was flood that's about one metre in height in one hour.  It's very quick.  I saw that.  Then I stand -- I stood next to the pits and I told them, "Come out, come out" including myself and others would catch the bin and water above my chest. Everybody was in the same situation. In the evening, about 3:00 p.m., then the water level went down. At that time, I rescued the prisoner and the guards to Chot's house.  It's the village chief of the Trapeang Traob village. And therefore there was no prisoner died in the flood there.  As I told Your Honours earlier, no one died in the flood.  No one climbed up into the tree.  And there was a small hill next to Chot's house.  Chot was the chief of the village and at that time we cross... we could not cross to the house of Brother Chot because there was a pond there.  And before the person did not see anything and come to testify at the court, we cannot say it is correct.

As for -- I tried to raise three children from their mother, but I could not do that, but they were not from Amleang. As for the flood, I would like to tell you the truth as the following.  A flood from the mountainous area, I had explained to the Chambers earlier that that day there was a slight rain at the place about 9:00 a.m. in the morning.  It was not a heavy rain that day, but there was flood that's about one metre in height in one hour.  It's very quick.  I saw that.  Then I stand -- I stood next to the pits and I told them, "Come out, come out" including myself and others would catch the bin and water above my chest. Everybody was in the same situation. In the evening, about 3:00 p.m., then the water level went down. At that time, I rescued the prisoner and the guards to Chot's house.  It's the village chief of the Trapeang Traob village. And therefore there was no prisoner died in the flood there.  As I told Your Honours earlier, no one died in the flood.  No one climbed up into the tree.  And there was a small hill next to Chot's house.  Chot was the chief of the village and at that time we cross... we could not cross to the house of Brother Chot because there was a pond there.  And before the person did not see anything and come to testify at the court, we cannot say it is correct.

As for -- I tried to raise three children from their mother, but I could not do that, but they were not from Amleang. As for the flood, I would like to tell you the truth as the following.  A flood from the mountainous area, I had explained to the Chambers earlier that that day there was a slight rain at the place about 9:00 a.m. in the morning.  It was not a heavy rain that day, but there was flood that's about one metre in height in one hour.  It's very quick.  I saw that.  Then I stand -- I stood next to the pits and I told them, "Come out, come out" including myself and others would catch the bin and water above my chest. Everybody was in the same situation. In the evening, about 3:00 p.m., then the water level went down. At that time, I rescued the prisoner and the guards to Chot's house.  It's the village chief of the Trapeang Traob village. And therefore there was no prisoner died in the flood there.  As I told Your Honours earlier, no one died in the flood.  No one climbed up into the tree.  And there was a small hill next to Chot's house.  Chot was the chief of the village and at that time we cross... we could not cross to the house of Brother Chot because there was a pond there.  And before the person did not see anything and come to testify at the court, we cannot say it is correct.

As for -- I tried to raise three children from their mother, but I could not do that, but they were not from Amleang. As for the flood, I would like to tell you the truth as the following.  A flood from the mountainous area, I had explained to the Chambers earlier that that day there was a slight rain at the place about 9:00 a.m. in the morning.  It was not a heavy rain that day, but there was flood that's about one metre in height in one hour.  It's very quick.  I saw that.  Then I stand -- I stood next to the pits and I told them, "Come out, come out" including myself and others would catch the bin and water above my chest. Everybody was in the same situation. In the evening, about 3:00 p.m., then the water level went down. At that time, I rescued the prisoner and the guards to Chot's house.  It's the village chief of the Trapeang Traob village. And therefore there was no prisoner died in the flood there.  As I told Your Honours earlier, no one died in the flood.  No one climbed up into the tree.  And there was a small hill next to Chot's house.  Chot was the chief of the village and at that time we cross... we could not cross to the house of Brother Chot because there was a pond there.  And before the person did not see anything and come to testify at the court, we cannot say it is correct.

As for -- I tried to raise three children from their mother, but I could not do that, but they were not from Amleang. As for the flood, I would like to tell you the truth as the following.  A flood from the mountainous area, I had explained to the Chambers earlier that that day there was a slight rain at the place about 9:00 a.m. in the morning.  It was not a heavy rain that day, but there was flood that's about one metre in height in one hour.  It's very quick.  I saw that.  Then I stand -- I stood next to the pits and I told them, "Come out, come out" including myself and others would catch the bin and water above my chest. Everybody was in the same situation. In the evening, about 3:00 p.m., then the water level went down. At that time, I rescued the prisoner and the guards to Chot's house.  It's the village chief of the Trapeang Traob village. And therefore there was no prisoner died in the flood there.  As I told Your Honours earlier, no one died in the flood.  No one climbed up into the tree.  And there was a small hill next to Chot's house.  Chot was the chief of the village and at that time we cross... we could not cross to the house of Brother Chot because there was a pond there.  And before the person did not see anything and come to testify at the court, we cannot say it is correct.

As for -- I tried to raise three children from their mother, but I could not do that, but they were not from Amleang. As for the flood, I would like to tell you the truth as the following.  A flood from the mountainous area, I had explained to the Chambers earlier that that day there was a slight rain at the place about 9:00 a.m. in the morning.  It was not a heavy rain that day, but there was flood that's about one metre in height in one hour.  It's very quick.  I saw that.  Then I stand -- I stood next to the pits and I told them, "Come out, come out" including myself and others would catch the bin and water above my chest. Everybody was in the same situation. In the evening, about 3:00 p.m., then the water level went down. At that time, I rescued the prisoner and the guards to Chot's house.  It's the village chief of the Trapeang Traob village. And therefore there was no prisoner died in the flood there.  As I told Your Honours earlier, no one died in the flood.  No one climbed up into the tree.  And there was a small hill next to Chot's house.  Chot was the chief of the village and at that time we cross... we could not cross to the house of Brother Chot because there was a pond there.  And before the person did not see anything and come to testify at the court, we cannot say it is correct.

Q. I'm going to quote what you said. Well, in fact, you mentioned his name at -- in the written record, D40/23, in Khmer 00165357; in French 00490912; English 00223212. Question: "Among the prisoners who were brought to the centre, were some released?" Your answer: "Only the female prisoners with their children were released, in particular, the family of Yeay Nhor," N-H-O-R, "And most of the prisoners died because they were ill or because they were executed. Very few prisoners survived. That is to say, Sen, who was one of them, who lives next to Angkor Leay pagoda." End of quote. And here you spoke about Yeay Nha's family, at answers 90 to 92, at E319.1.3. So those are answers 90 to 92, you spoke about certain members of Yeay Nhor's family, or Yeay Nha, who were detained but who survived Krang Ta Chan. And you also said in your written record of interview, which I just quoted from, that prisoners died because they had been beaten during the interrogations and you also spoke about Yeay Nha's husband as well as the spouse of a -- spouse of a surname Rat (phonetic) was one of Yeay Nha's daughters. Can you tell us when you arrived at Krang Ta Chan, were the members of this family, the family of Yeay Nha, were they already on site, or did they arrive after you had been assigned to Krang Ta Chan?
