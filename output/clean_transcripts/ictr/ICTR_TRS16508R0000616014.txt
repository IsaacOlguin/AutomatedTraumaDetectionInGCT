MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  Good morning ladies and gentleman.
Mr. Witness, the Defence is going to proceed with its cross-
examination.  We would like to remind you that you're still under
oath.
For your information, yesterday there was control carried out in
respect of the transcript or the transcripts were verified.  The
unredacted part of the Defence -- of the transcript as requested by
Defence, this document was then given to the legal assistants for the
Defence and a second disclosure was made.  At this time, therefore,
the Defence has the documents.
MR. POGNON:
My earphones were not working.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could Counsel Pognon be assisted.  I think his headphones or earphones
are not working.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Pognon.
MR. POGNON:
I have just received from the translation service, a letter in which
we were informed that out of the 494 pages requested for translation,
have already been translated and are available for us in the
language service.  We have just been informed of this.  We do not have
them as yet.  We shall go to the translation service in a while to
take them, but the rest are still to be translated.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Counsel, I, myself, told you this yesterday to tell you
that these documents were available.  So as we requested of you, try
to find out which documents are most urgent for you so that they
should be translated as a matter of priority.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, you have the floor to proceed with your cross-
examination of the witness.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President. Good morning, Madam President.  Good
morning, Your Honours.
WITNESS CBS
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Good morning, CBS.
A.   Good morning.
Q.   Before we get to the heart of the matter, I would like once more to
refer to your document, that is, your statement of Wednesday, 12 March
.  This is on page K262138, the second paragraph on that page.
You said this, "After listening to a rereading of my statements, I
wish to remove the name of Aloys Nishirimbere from the list of (french
spoken).  I identified him as (french spoken) in my statements of 1995
and 1996.  I had erroneously included Aloys in the attackers because I
thought that all the communal policemen had participated in the
attacks.  In talking with people, I learnt that Aloys had not
participated in the killings at the church which is why today I am
removing him from this list.  I saw policemen in uniform and I thought
he was amongst them."  Do you agree that this is your statement of the
th of March 2003?
A.   Yes, I confirm that this is my statement.  I thought that all the
policemen were present at the scene, but later on I learnt that
Nishirimbere was actually in the commune office and, consequently, he
had not reached the church.  It was he who was guarding the commune
office.
Q.   This is honourable of you and this is why I'm going to put the
following questions to you.  When you state that you thought that all
the communal policemen had participated in the killing, at the time
you said it, were you able to count or to determine which of the
communal policemen were participating in the killing?
A.   I was not able to determine how many policemen.  This means that I
knew that most, if not all, would come and ride around in vehicles
transporting people to the church.  And you must understand that on
that Friday no one stayed behind; everybody ran forward to participate
in this attack which was taking place in the parish.  The policemen,
under the leadership of the judicial police inspector, were all
present.  Everybody was present under the authority of the judicial
police inspector to say that Nishirimbere was not there, I can confirm
now.  At that particular time he was standing guard at the commune
office.
Q.   You said at one point -- I am trying to find the place in the
transcript -- that you identified four policemen and four gendarmes.
You said that you identified four policemen and four gendarmes.  At
the time, were you able to determine -- first of all, did you know
these four policemen?  Do you know the four policemen, that is, the
commune policemen?
A.   The four policemen that I mentioned I remember, but I did not give
names at the time because nobody asked me.  Also you must know that
the commune did not have many policemen.  In any case, there were
never more than nine, so there was a limited number of policemen.
Q.   Very well.  So if these four policemen were known to you, how did it
happen that since you also knew Aloys that you made a mistake and
first said that he was amongst the (French spoken)?
A.   I am telling you that nobody had stayed at the commune office.
However, I am telling you that I learnt that Nishirimbere had, indeed,
stayed in the commune -- or, the communal office, whereas, the other
policemen had come to the place of massacres with other authorities.
Q.   Now, let us return to the moment at which you received this contrary
information.  Under what circumstances were you informed that you had
been in error.  What were the circumstances under which you received
this information?
A.   I found out later.  Because at the time of the events I was at the
church, and it must be noted that some people went to take refuge in
the commune office and Nishirimbere was there.  These people who had
sought refuge in the commune office left it after that, but I cannot
tell you in which direction they went.
Q.   That is not the answer to my question.  You had stated earlier that
in talking with people -- I shall be more precise, "In talking with
people", you said, so with whom did you talk in order to find out that
actually Aloys was not amongst the killers?
A.   I have been explaining this to you.  Perhaps I'm not making myself
sufficiently clear.  I told you that I learnt of this afterwards.
There were people who had sought refuge in the commune office which
left -- they left subsequently, but at the time that they went to the
commune office Nishirimbere was there standing guard.  There were
people in the commune office who were still alive, so it is these
people who told me this and who told me that Nishirimbere was on duty
at the commune office, and that up to the end of the war he was at the
commune office, but the other policemen had left the commune office
and none of them were left there.  Please, let me go on.  So if I said
this in the statement I thought that all the figures of authority
rushed to the church which is what caused me to say what I said
before.  It is when the investigators came I thought that no one had
stayed in the commune office, but afterwards the people who sought in
the commune office and who are still alive told me that Nishirimbere
was on duty at the commune office.
Q.   Did you learn, at the time when the investigators came, or did you
learn of this before their arrival?
A.   These investigators came and I only learnt of this afterwards.  It is
therefore after the investigation that I had with the first -- or, the
interview that I had with the first investigators.  The investigators
had already contacted me and I found out this information afterwards.
Q.   Thank you.  Do you not think that after -- that from the people whom
you had included, amongst the (French spoken), is it not possible that
you also made a mistake with other people whom you included in the
group?
A.   I think that there's no other person about whom I made a mistake.
Apart from this person, I don't see how I could have made a mistake
about any other one.
Q.   Last question on this point: you said that it is the persons who
remained in the commune office and who had seen Aloys, who told you
when you spoke with them.  Was it a discussion that you had in passing
on one occasion, or was it a discussion within a determined framework
to revise the statements?
A.   These people did not know that I was still alive.  And quite by
chance we met and I asked them the circumstances under which their
lives were saved, and they said they were in the commune office.  They
told me that at one point they were chased out of the commune office.
They were hidden by several families.  It was the very first time that
I met them and I wished to ask them how they had managed to survive.
This is when they told me that it is Nishirimbere who was protecting
them at the commune office and that is how light was shed on this
matter.
Q.   Thank you.  You explained that you arrived at the parish.  I believe
it was on a Monday at five o'clock in the morning.
A.   No, that is not true.  I said that I arrived on Tuesday morning, not
Monday.  I never said anything about Monday.
Q.   I beg your pardon.  So you left your home on Monday and you arrived
in the small hours of Tuesday morning?
A.   I told you that on Monday evening people were killed on my hill.  I
spent the night roaming here and there in the surroundings.  Very
early in the morning of the next day, I moved towards the parish, and
that is the day on which I arrived at the parish.
Q.   I was saying the same thing.  Perhaps I said in the small hours, I
meant about five in the morning.  I meant about five in the morning,
the same thing?
A.   Yes, very early in the morning on Tuesday.  Counsel, could you please
repeat the question?
Q.   You left -- at what time did you leave the parish exactly?
A.   Do you mean when I left the parish or the time when I went there?
Q.   When you left, when was that?
A.   I left the parish in the night of Friday.
Q.   You went somewhere -- and I'm trying to look for the transcripts
because we need to be clear on this issue.  You stated that you left --
you said, "I left the church on Friday after the first attack."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can you tell us which transcripts you are using and what
page.
MR. POGNON:
It is the transcript or statement of 2nd February 1996.  It is the
document without the cover page.  And the page is K0026097, manuscript
page 2348, that is, the manuscript page number.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   "I left the church after the first attack on Friday, the 15th of
April.  And in the same statement", and that is on page K009628, you
state, "I left the church at nine o'clock and I hid myself below the
road in the vicinity.  I left the church at nine o'clock and hid
myself below the road in the vicinity.  Page K002698.
A.   Do you want me to answer that question, Counsel?
Q.   Well, I'm not done yet because you need to explain -- to make
explanations on the various versions that you gave.
And then, still the transcripts of 2nd February 1996, that has a cover
page, you stated as follows: "I left the church at 9 p.m. on Friday
and hid myself below the road in the vicinity.  That is at page
K0271024 and manuscript -- the number written on the manuscript is
bis.  Now, we are dealing with the three versions of the same
assertion.  Can you explain or can you tell us if you've given those
three statements in the different transcripts that I have just read?
A.   No, that is not how I said it.  I said I left the church, indeed, at
p.m.  I had to wait for the night to fall.  I didn't have a watch,
so I passed by the fence -- behind the fence of the priests'
residence.  People were still killing people.  And when places got
dark I passed by the fence of the priests.  I didn't say that I hid
very close to the road; I went into a bush behind the fence of the
presbytery in the wood.  And while I was in that wood, that small
forest, there were people who were moving about who were trying to see
those who were fleeing from the scene of the killings.  And for a
minute I hid behind a bush and then I left and went away.  I did not
say that I hid myself near a road; I said that I left the place or
that scene in the night, so that explains the time at which I left the
church and I kept moving until I reached Nyabarongo and then I got to
the Gitarama préfecture.  And at that time the killings hadn't started
in Gitarama.  That is how I explained the manner in which I left my
church.  Now concerning the circumstances in which I left my home, I
told you --
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, we would like to wish that when the witness is giving
answers, you know, that go beyond the scope of my question I would
like that you stop him because I didn't ask him to talk about the
circumstance surrounding -- him leaving his house.
THE WITNESS:
In any case, at some other point, you ask me questions concerning the
circumstances surrounding the departure from my home right up to the
church.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, try to answer the questions concisely.  You don't need to
back track or to go back to what happened before.  Please address the
questions that are put to you.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   We are going to try to shed light on this point.  To get there, can
you please kindly tell us concisely, by giving us a concise
description, of what you did when you decided to go away from the
church?  Tell us how you left the church, please.  Tell us what
happened up until you left?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, he has already answered the question.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, there are other questions that I will be putting to
him,  but I want light to be shed to this.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But if you're taking us backwards whereas he has already answered the
questions -- whereas, you, yourself, say that he will be addressing
others I think we will be losing time.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, the issue is as follows.  This question is related to
other questions.  There is a nexus between this question and the other
questions.  I mean, what do you want me to do?  I cannot move further
ahead if I don't have certain clarifications.
JUDGE KAM:
Counsel, the Chamber is of the opinion that the witness has actually
described all the stages he went through up until the time he got the
wood.  From that, can't you ask your questions, you know, based on the
description that he gave?
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   You left the church -- how did you leave the church?
A.   I told you that I lay under the roof of a stable or cow shed.
Grenades were being thrown towards the rear part of the presbytery, so
I tried to cross the fence -- to climb the fence, over the fence, and
behind the fence there is only bush or some wooded land, and further
down near the banana plantation of the priests, there is a bush.  I
was able to see people who were looking for me and I went further down
and I was no longer hearing any other person moving about.  I
continued towards Gitarama because I had heard that it was safe there.
I passed by Zegenya in the Kigali secteur at Bambiro right up to when
I went to near Birambo and I crossed the river, and I went to the
Gitarama préfecture.  Things were calm there and people hadn't started
being killed there.  It was a Saturday.  I went to the Gitarama
préfecture territory and on the spot I realised that there were
refugees who had come from all over and who were going towards Kabgayi
and I went to Kabgayi where I stayed for some time.  To leave Kabgayi
--
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you have any other questions, Counsel?
MR. POGNON:
I would like only to point out that he goes beyond the scope of my
questions.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   You stated that you used the roof of stable or cow or cattle shed.  I
am going to read what you wrote or what you stated in the transcript
of 17 August 2000.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I don't know if he meant 7th or 17th.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   That is on page K0152108.  "I succeeded in fleeing by using the roof
of poultry -- of a chicken pen as a hiding place.  I stayed there
throughout the night without moving about and at night I got down from
the roof and I went to the forest of the parish."   Is it a stable or
a cattle shed or the roof of a chicken shelter?
A.   I will explain things to you.  I was, first of all, in a chicken pen
and then I went to the cow shed which was covered with zinc sheets and
that is where I lay.  Now, as concerns the chicken shed, well, I said
in my statement that I passed by the chicken shed and I lay on the
roof over the cow shed up until the time that I left that location.
Q.   Well, Mr. Witness, in all the statements that you made, it's only
yesterday that instead of a chicken shed you mentioned a cow shed.
Yesterday you talked about a cow shed.  Today I read your statement to
you where you mentioned the chicken shed and you talked -- and you
stated you used the two; that is, the chicken shed and the cow shed.
Are we going to take the two statements?
A.   You are forgetting another room.  I also told you that when I left
the corridor of the building of the priest, I went to a store where
beans were stored and I continued right to the chicken shed and then I
went up to the other -- I mean, these are rooms that are joining each
other, so I had to pass through those various areas.  I did not enter
straight into the bean shed.  I passed by, then I passed through the
chicken shed.  Then, from there, I went up to the roof of the cow shed
and that is where I lay.  That is how things happened.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, at this stage, I think we should show the witness the
photographs of the sites so that he can identify the various places
for us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well and good.
Mr. Court assistant, do you want to pull the curtains so the witness
can move to where the overhead projector is.  Wait a minute.
Mr. Witness, can you move towards the overhead projector, please.
MR. POGNON:
I'd like him to be shown, first of all, the sketch of the scene, that
is, P. 2A.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Court assistant, can you bring out the Exhibit P. 2A?
Counsel Pognon, if you wish to show him other exhibits you can already
give us the reference numbers thereof so that will expedite things.
MR. POGNON:
Yes.  P. 3-4; P. 3-14.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness is at your disposal.  If there are others probably your
assistant should disclose them to the court assistant.
MR. POGNON:
I thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Mr. Witness, we're going to show you the plan of the investigator,
that is, the plan of the location, and you're going to tell us if --
first of all, how you got to the parish.  Now, this is the plan.
You'll indicate -- you know the place and you'll tell us how you got
to that location, that is, to the parish?
MR. POGNON:
I'm not receiving any translation.  The Kinyarwanda interpreters
cannot hear the witness because he does not have a microphone that is
lit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you hear him now?
MR. POGNON:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, I can hear him in Kinyarwanda.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth is also hearing him well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How about the French booth -- the English booth as well?  Can you give
us the interpretation in English?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, of course, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then witness can go over what you said before because we didn't hear
him the first time around.  Witness, please repeat your answer.
THE WITNESS:
The counsel just asked me the road I took to get to the parish.  I
think that is the question.  Now, the route I took from my village --
from my village, I used a small pathways and I got to the hospital and
then I reached the sisters' residence and then I reached a place
called Gishushu and that is where there is a road that goes to the
church.  Right now it is a tarred road.  When you get here you make a
detour and then you get to the -- parish.  That is the road that I
took to get to the church.
MR. POGNON:
I am not seeing the indications that he's giving.  Let him use the
pencil that he has or even his hand to make the indications.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you don't have any problem with that sketch or with that
plan.  Can you find your way through it?  Can you understand what is
drawn in that sketch?
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President --
THE WITNESS:
I see where it is written Nyange.  I also see a road and I think this
is the main road that has been tarred.  That is where you have a road
that deviates to the church and that is the road that I was talking
about.  I was saying that that is the road I took to go to the church.
There is only one small road which joined the main road and that is a
small road, a path I took to go to the church coming from the main
road.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Still, using that plan, can you indicate the itinerary you used to
get out of the parish, or to leave the parish?
A.   You cannot see the area through which I passed to get out of the
parish because it does not feature on this sketch.
Q.   You have the sketch.  Can you see the presbytery or the priest'
residential quarters?  Can you see the priests' house?
A.   I believe I am seeing a house.  I am supposing that this is a house
in front of the priests' house, but you see the courtyard of the
presbytery which is in front where you got before getting to the
priests' house.  So the courtyard through which I passed is behind
because there are two yards.  The presbytery has two courtyards.  I
passed through a rear courtyard where we have the poultry shed or the
chicken shed and the cow shed I talked about, but those things are not
on this sketch.
Q.   So where you passed by -- please, maintain the sketch or the plan
there.  So is it a place -- or, where you passed through, is it the
place that is marked in yellow lines behind the main building or,
behind a taller building?
A.   No, that is not where I passed through the place marked in yellow.
The place that is marked in yellow is on the other side of the
presbytery.  Actually, there is -- where I passed through there is
another courtyard where you have the cow shed and the chicken shed,
and there's a big fence that surrounds the entire property of the
priest's.  After the war I can say -- besides, they have built other --
new houses, but going by this plan, I can't see the places I've
passed through.  There are houses that are near the road, near the --
that is, outside the front yard of the church.  And the rear courtyard
behind the presbytery, that is where I hid.
Q.   Giving indications on which the Defence and the Prosecution agree,
and the investigators, rather, agree on.  Where you have the cross,
that is where you have the church.  Now, the small building where
there's some shade of yellow, those are the offices of the parish.
The other building that is taller, which is behind the parish offices,
is the presbytery, that is, the residential quarters of the priests.
Is that correct?
A.   Yes, I do agree with you there.
Q.   Now, let's proceed.  There's something that is not on that plan.  I'm
referring to the kitchens.  You can't see them on that plan.  Now, the
area that is marked in yellow, that is, the loop behind the tall
building.  That location, I think, is supposed to be the place which
you passed because I think that is where you have the kitchens under
the chicken shed and the other rooms.  But then, those buildings are --
or, that structure is not there either?
A.   Yes, those small houses are not visible.
Q.   But apparently that is where you have the outhouse, the chicken shed,
et cetera.
A.   Yes.
Q.   And cow shed as well?
A.   Yes, that is what I was saying.
Q.   So was it therefore -- that is, is it that a yellow loop that you had
to cross in order to leave the parish in order to go and hide in the
bush?
A.   It was through the inner courtyard that I passed.  I was laying on
the cow shed.  And that cow shed was facing the -- or left to the
exterior of the wall, so I climbed the -- passing through the roof of
the cow shed, I climbed the wall and I got out of the courtyard.  As
you can see where there's a cross, that's where the church was.  And
at the inner courtyard through which I passed, even the house of the
priests is also found in the inner courtyard vis-à-vis the church, so
I passed through that location to go out and also passed through this
other location to get in.
(Pages 1 to 10 by Roxane Lane)
H
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   So we agree on that.  It is through that location that you -- that
is, it is through that area that you got there and it is through that
area that you left; is that it?
A.   When the massacres started, I climbed the wall of the inner courtyard
of the presbytery, and this is not visible on the map.  On the other
side of the courtyard of the presbytery, there was another courtyard,
and that is what I am referring to which, is not visible.  The other
courtyard of the presbytery, that was where the chicken shed was, and
I climbed the wall on that side to get out of the premises.  So I
didn't come from the courtyard which is visible on the map.  I came
from the other courtyard, which is not visible, and not from the one
which is visible.
Q.   In order for us to clarify matters further before removing this map
or plan, you said you came through the small footpath?
A.   Yes, you're right, I came in through the small footpath.
Q.   Now, in order to leave, you state that you climbed the small wall,
climbed over the small wall to the back of the wall, that is the wall
that is fencing around the parish and which is more or less near the
chicken shed; is that correct?
A.   Yes, of course.  The chicken shed is inside the premises, yes.  The
houses and the chicken shed are inside the premises, of course.
Q.   You climbed over that wall.
A.   That is correct.
Q.   We can remove that map then.
A.   So when I climbed over the wall I fell into the inner courtyard.
That is where I climbed over the wall and I fell behind.  That was
when I was going to the church, of course.
Q.   So to get to the church, you climbed over the wall and you fell
inside the church premises?
A.   Right.
Q.   And that wall is on what side?  Can you please tell us where that
wall is where you climbed over?  Point to it with your pencil.  Point
exactly where you climbed over the wall to get into the courtyard.
A.   You mean when I was arriving, at the time when I was arriving?  When
I arrived?
Q.   Yes, when you arrived, you climbed over the wall in order to get into
the church premises.
A.   Yes, I passed through this small path.  I arrived in the courtyard in
front of the church.  We spent a few days there in that courtyard, but
in the evening, we would sleep in the church.  On the day of the
massacres, therefore, that was the Friday, we were in the courtyard
and we were throwing stones at the assailants.  Some of them fled --
some people fled towards the presbytery.  As for myself, I climbed
over the wall that was opposite.  I climbed over that wall, and when I
climbed over that wall, I fell into the courtyard where the kitchen is
located, so I fell into another courtyard where the kitchen was
situated.  As you can see, there is a courtyard here which is visible.
That is the courtyard of the presbytery.  There is another courtyard
behind, which is not visible.  One courtyard is visible, that is the
one near the office, and there is a wall.  That is where the office
and the presbytery are.  There is another courtyard which is behind,
and that is where I climbed over a wall and I fell into another
courtyard, which is not visible.  And to get out, I, of course, came
out towards that area in yellow.  I didn't go back to the church.
That is where I passed near the beans store, near the cow shed and the
chicken shed to get outside, but I first lay on the roof, and from
there I could see the presbytery courtyard without being seen by
anybody.  That is where I spent the night, and then I came down
discreetly.  I fell outside the wall in the woods, and I continued.
Nobody lived there, and that area is called Mu Kagina, and I believe
the priest knows that area.
Q.   I thank you.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I would like the witness to be shown photograph P.
.  That is the Prosecution Exhibit, P. 34.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Do you recognise that area?
A.   Yes, I can see the photograph.
Q.   Is the building at the back, where you can see two windows, is that
the presbytery, that is, the priests' house where they live?
A.   Yes, the priests lived in that, building that storey building.
Q.   And next to this building, that is the building that the -- the long
building, do you know that building?
A.   Yes, I also know this building.
Q.   Was that the building into which you went?
A.   Yes, I went into this building.  That was indeed the kitchen, but I
told you that I went in precisely through the kitchen where the
priests' food was cooked.
Q.   Can you show us that place on the photograph?  Can you show us where
that is on the photograph?
A.   As you can see, these three doors that are facing us, I believe the
courtyard we can see is the back courtyard, but I told you that when I
went in, I came in from behind this kitchen.  That was where I climbed
over the wall.  I was there where they cook food.  It's a kind of
refectory for the priests.  It's one of the three doors, but I'm not
quite sure which of those doors leads into the priests' refectory.
And the house is still there today.  I believe it was not destroyed.
MR. POGNON:
I would like the witness to be shown P. 224 -- P. 223, I beg your
pardon.  P. 223.  It is not a Prosecution exhibit.  It is K0271700,
photograph number 8.  K0771700, photograph number 8.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Do you recognise this photograph?
A.   Yes, I do.  This is a new building that was built.  It was in the
rear courtyard.  At the time this particular house did not exist in
the inner courtyard of the presbytery.  It is a new building.
Q.   Photograph K0271702.  K0271702.  Do you recognise this photograph?
A.   Yes, I recognise this house.  This was the latrine which was situated
in the inner courtyard of the presbytery.
Q.   From looking at this photograph, can you tell the Chamber where you
were hiding?  Was it to the left or to the right of the photograph?
Even if it is not on the left or the right, can you say more or less
where it was, in what direction?
A.   I stated to you that these are public latrines that were in the inner
courtyard of the presbytery.  I never got to this place.  As a matter
of fact, I more or less climbed over behind these latrines.  These
latrines are in the inner courtyard of the priests' premises, so I
therefore did not get to this location.  However, the wall I climbed
over was behind these latrines.  There was even a small path leading
to the banana plantation of the priests.  That was where I climbed
over the wall to fall out of the presbytery.  This means that the
houses I showed you in which priests lived were in the same courtyard
and behind where I passed.  There was also a big gate through which
vehicles entered.  This means that the priests' house was more to the
right.  I do recognise this place, even though I didn't get there on
that day.  These are latrines that were opposite another old building
where catechism lessons were given.
Q.   Do you agree that these latrines are in the rear courtyard?
A.   No, I do not agree with you.  Those latrines are in the front
courtyard.
Q.   Are you sure?  Do we take it that you are asserting that these
latrines are in the front courtyard?
A.   Yes.  I believe that these latrines that we can see on the photograph
-- you saw the presbytery, you saw the entrance to the presbytery.
There is another entrance, and when I refer to these latrines, I am
referring to the front courtyard.  As for myself, I passed through the
rear courtyard that is behind the wall of the presbytery, and I fell
behind.  I passed behind these latrines.  I told you that there are
two courtyards.  There is the front courtyard.  When you get into the
presbytery of the parish you can see it, and there is also the place
you showed me where the kitchen is, and there is the courtyard where
the chicken shed and the cow shed are situated.  I did not recognise
the other buildings you showed me.  That building I didn't recognise
was in the rear courtyard, and that is where I came out, so I came out
near the chicken shed and the cow shed.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is not speaking into his microphone.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   I would like you to confirm that these latrines are in front of the
courtyard -- that they are in the front courtyard of the presbytery.
If your answer is yes, say yes; if it is no, say no.  That is all we
want you to say.
A.   These latrines that you see are built, as you can see.  As I can see
them, in my opinion, these latrines are in the front courtyard.
Q.   Thank you.
A.   Behind these latrines are other latrines.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is not speaking into his microphone, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you finished with this photograph?
MR. POGNON:
Yes.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel speak into his microphone, please, Madam President?
MR. POGNON:
I would like the witness to be shown Exhibit P. 307.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Do you recognise this location?
A.   This photograph does not ring a bell.  I know nothing about this
photograph.
MR. POGNON:
Can the witness be shown photograph K0261678?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you give us the page, Counsel?
MR. POGNON:
It's on page 5.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Can you tell us something about these premises, this location?
A.   The premises on this photograph, even though it is not clear, is
where the church was located.  Pillars have been built and that is
where the genocide memorial is found.
Q.   I thank you.
MR. POGNON:
Let the witness be shown K0333566.  That is on page 5.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, perhaps your assistant could help identify the pages well in
advance.
MR. POGNON:
That is what we are trying to do.  It is a K number.  The Prosecutor
did not exhibit it.  It is K0333566.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you do not give us the page, it won't be easy to find this
photograph.
MR. POGNON:
This is the K number that was given to us.  As for the page, the
Prosecutor did not indicate it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is on page 27, I believe.  Please look on page 27.
THE WITNESS:
I recognise this photograph.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, please use your microphone.
MR. POGNON:
I do not see the photograph on the screen.  The photograph is not on
my screen.  Could you please show the photograph that we are seeing on
the overhead projector?  All right, that is done.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Do you recognise this, please?
A.   I recognise the place represented in this photograph or depicted in
this photograph.  This building is in the courtyard of the presbytery.
It was the priests' house.  You go in through an entrance.  There is
a gate and the house that juts out on this side, which you can see, is
the house about which I told you which was used as a kitchen, but this
place I am showing you is in the front yard.  This object here in the
middle is the water tank.
Q.   Thank you.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I would like to tender as a Defence exhibit the
following:  K0271702.  It is picture number 9.  K0271705, picture
number 10.  K0261678, this is, I believe, photograph number 5.  I
believe it's photograph 27.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It seems to me, Counsel, that amongst these photographs that you have
just referred to there was one that was not shown to the witness.
Number 10, I believe it is.
MR. POGNON:
On the contrary, it has been presented, I think.  I beg your pardon, I
do not wish to tender that photograph.  It has not been presented.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we are going to remove that photograph from the list you have
given.
MR. POGNON:
There is one last photograph.  We are just going to tender one last
photograph and then it will be over.  We have K0271700, which should,
I believe, be D. 12.  I believe it is D. 14 instead.  K0271702, that
is D. 14.  And then we shall take D. 15, which is exhibit number
K0261678, photograph number 27.  That will be D. 15.  And the very
last, we are going to be showing the last photograph and that will be
over.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you like to present the last photograph before?
MR. POGNON:
It's K027 -- just a minute.  K0271705.  I repeat, K0271705.
Photograph number 10.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is this what you wish to tender?  I believe that you mentioned it, but
you did not say that you wished to tender it before.
MR. POGNON:
Yes, that is it.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Do you recognise this photograph?
A.   Yes, I can see this photograph.  This photograph depicts the
courtyard that I told about, because this door led to the animal pen
and this is the door through which the cows left the pen.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I would like to tender this photograph as an exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, do you wish us to tender all the photographs or just
this one?
MR. POGNON:
I gave photograph number 9, K027 -- photograph 27, actually, and this
photograph.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You're referring to photograph number 5 then.
MR. POGNON:
Photograph number 5.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which you showed a while ago.
MR. POGNON:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is what I have.  K0271702, photograph number 9, you wish to
tender it as Exhibit D. 14.
MR. POGNON:
D. 14.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then you have K0261678, that will be D. 15.  K033566, that is
photograph number 27, which will be D.16, and the photograph that we
have just seen, which is K0271705, which will be photograph number 10
and Exhibit D. 17.  Is that all right?
MR. POGNON:
Yes.  Madam President, we still have the plan.  This is a Prosecution
exhibit, so there is no problem with its being tendered.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are there any objections on the part of the Prosecution?
MS. ALEXIS:
No.  I, however, was not certain that every photograph that was shown
to the witness was, in fact, admitted as a Defence exhibit.  As long
as that is so, I would have no difficulties, because it would be
difficult later on to find that the witness has made comments about
photos that are not properly admitted before the Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. POGNON:
No, no, it's all right.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Trial Chamber enters and admits these as Defence exhibits.  I do not
need to repeat the numbers.  It is exactly what I said a while ago,
from Exhibit D. 14 to D. 17.
(Exhibit No. D. 14 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. 15 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. 16 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. 17 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, you may proceed.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Witness, we have located or determined where you stayed till
nightfall.  You said, to come to
Father Seromba, when you arrived at the parish, did you see him when
you arrived at the parish?  Did you see him?
A.   Yes, I saw him.  He was on site, and until I left the parish, he was
there.
Q.   Did you see other clergymen?
A.   Yes, I saw them.
Q.   Do you know them?
A.   I cannot distinguish them, but I heard that there was a priest and a
major seminarian.
Q.   Did you see them or did you hear that there was priest and a major
seminarian?
A.   You will understand that I saw them in passing, but I did not know
whether the persons that I had seen were the priest or major
seminarian or vice versa, but these people were present.
Q.   You saw them pass by?  You did not know whether they were priests?  I
have not finished my question.  How did you distinguish them as being
clergymen at that place when you arrived?
A.   The people who were at that place said that there was a priest and a
major seminarian.  It was said that there was a certain Appolinaire,
and another one who was called Baltazar.  I had heard about these
people, but I could not tell who was who, and I could not conclude
that one was a priest and the other was a major seminarian, but at the
time these two people were present, I cannot claim that I knew these
people very well.
Q.   Thank you.  And where did you see them?
A.   I saw them there at the parish.  These people lived there.  When we
sought refuge at this place, these people were there.
Q.   For more clarity, did you see them where the priests lived?  Did you
see them where the offices are located?  Just a minute.  Just a moment
so that I can give you all the options.  Did you see them where the
priests live in their house?  Did you see them where the offices are,
or did you see them around the church, where the church is?  Where
exactly?
A.   I saw them at the presbytery, at the priests' house.  As you saw, it
was said that one of these persons was a priest and that the other was
a major seminarian.  I did not seek to find out more.  Those who knew
them said there was priest, such-and-such a priest, and such-and-such
a major seminarian.
Q.   You said also that you could not determine who was who.
A.   I still could not tell them apart now, but some people were saying
that there was priest and a major seminarian, but at the time, these
two people were there.
Q.   What were they doing there?  What were they doing on their balcony of
their house, since you say you saw them there?
A.   I didn't see them do anything.  I saw them.  They were standing there
doing nothing in particular.
Q.   I shall read to you your statement.  This is on page K -- this is a
transcript of 12 March 2003, pages K00262139.  You said this: "I know
the seminarians Appolinaire and Baltazar.  It is difficult for me to
tell them apart from the group of priests, brothers and seminarians.
Amongst this group, I believe I remember I saw one of these persons
carrying a bow while he was standing on the balcony."
You have just said that you saw them doing nothing in particular.
Which is the answer that we should take as being a final one?
A.   I'd like to tell you that upon my arrival in Nyange, you can count
the days yourself that I spent there.  You asked me whether I saw them
upon my arrival.  I saw them upon my arrival, I saw them the following
day, and in respect of what you have just said, I told you that they
were on the verandah.  They spent their day on the verandah.  What I
said about my statement is particularly what happened on Friday.  This
person, either priest or major seminarian, was carrying a bow and
arrows, and it was Friday, but as to the other days, that is Wednesday
and Thursday, these people were there.  You asked me whether these
people were there and I said that I saw them.  I told you when I
arrived and on the day that I spent there until the last day I was
there, that's where they were.
Q.   So what you mean is that you saw them at the parish before the
attack, and during the attack you saw them -- you saw one of them with
an arrow?
A.   Quite, yes, during the attack.
Q.   Did you identify the one who was armed with a bow?
A.   I told you that I did not know this person, but those who knew him,
or knew them, said that this person carrying a bow was a major
seminarian.  It is the person who had a bow.
Q.   Who told you that the person who was carrying the bow was a major
seminarian?  Who gave you this information?
A.   These were people who were present there.  The person who was working
there is no longer alive.  This person is deceased.  It was a parish
employee.  The person is dead.  This person was called Alexi.  It is
he who was familiar with these people.  He lived with them.
Q.   Do you mean that while the attack -- when the attack had begun and
you were fleeing, you had the time to see somebody who was carrying a
bow on the priest's balcony, and you had the time to have near you a
person who could tell you about the person who was carrying the bow?
Is that what you mean, during the attack?
A.   At the very beginning of the attack, when the gendarmes told us to
defend ourselves, that is when I saw this major seminarian carrying
the bow.  And Alexi told me that the major seminarian was carrying a
bow.  What followed is that there was confrontation.  We threw stones
and I no longer paid attention.  We were throwing stones.  People were
coming to kill us, so it was a confrontation.
Q.   Thank you.  On this last page, you continued, or you went on to say,
"Since the attack began at about 10 o'clock, I saw these people
together before that time."  "I saw these people together before that
time."
So if I take that phrase, do you not think that there is a
contradiction between what you have just said and this sentence, which
is a sentence or is a phrase said by you and reported by the
investigators?  "Since the attack began at 10 o'clock, I saw these
people together before that time."  Should we take it that it was well
before the attack that you saw those people on the balcony, one of
whom was carrying a bow, or was it when the attack began, because I
read here "before that hour"?
A.   It was when the attack had just been launched and the gendarmes had
just said that they had firearms with which to defend themselves, so
it was during the attack, the very beginning of the attack in
question.
Q.   I will take your statement as such.  I will proceed if you allow me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, if you ask the witness a question, please let him.  Give him
the time to answer, because he was still trying to answer your
question.
MR. POGNON:
I thought he had already answered the question.  We had been on that
question for a while.
THE WITNESS:
No, it was during the attack when the gendarmes had just told us that
they couldn't protect us.  I told you that the location had already
been surrounded, the entire place had been surrounded, and so we tried
to defend ourselves by throwing stones.  Women were giving us stones.
They were distributing stones to the men, and in the confusion, Alexi,
who was an employee of the priests, said, "Can you see even the major
seminarian have bows and arrow?"  So it was during the attack.  It
wasn't before the attack.  It was on that Friday, but then on the
previous days that they were there at the location, they were not
carrying any weapon, they were just like people who were at their
home.  I am talking about the other days.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   So we can take it that since that sentence does reflect what you had
said, and, "Since the attack began at around 10 o'clock, I saw those
people before that hour."  This is not a question as such, it is only
a comment, so I will continue with reading into that document on the
same page.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
"Before that hour" -- probably we should explain that it is not --
well, it's a problem with the French.  That is "cet" in French.  Here
it doesn't mean 7 o'clock, but that hour.  C-E-T, cet.
Please, do you still have much time to do the cross-examination of the
witness, because I think we will be moving.  It is already time for
the short break.
MR. POGNON:
I have a last question.  I think we can finish with that page.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   You wrote, Mr. CBS, still on the subject, "Amongst those persons --"
Now, I will let go that sentence.  Yes, "Amongst those persons --"
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, probably we’ll make a rectification here.  He did not write
anything; he stated or said.
MR. POGNON:
Yes, I stand corrected, Madam President.
BY MR. POGNON.
Q.   So your statement was written down as follows: "Amongst those
persons, one of them was carrying a bow, and I couldn't tell the
identity of the person who was carrying the bow," so, well -- and you
said especially that, "I know it wasn't Father Seromba who was
carrying a weapon because I never saw him with a weapon."  Do you
confirm that statement?
A.   Do you want me to affirm that I saw Father Seromba carrying a weapon?
Q.   Well, what I said is that you stated that it wasn't Father Seromba
who was carrying a weapon because you had never seen him carrying a
weapon.  Is that what you stated, because that is what is written
here?
A.   I said that during -- on the day of the attack, that person was a
seminarian, and when the confrontation began, that person was carrying
a bow and he had arrows.  Now, when you talk about Father Seromba
carrying a weapon, I never said that he was carrying a weapon.  Even
if such statements were written down it wouldn't reflect what I had
said.
Q.   Thank you.  I didn't say that you are the one who said so.  I only
want you to confirm what you had said and what you have just said
again.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What this means is that probably the entire sentence should have been
read out to him because you only read a portion of it and probably
that's why he didn't understand you.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I think we can end here if the Chamber so wishes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court stands adjourned for 15 minutes.
(Court recessed at 1105H)
(Pages 11 to 21 by Trevor Gerbes)
(Court resumed at 1130H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.
Maître Pognon, you have the floor and you can continue your cross-
examination.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Mr. CBS, we will now go to another stage of your statement.  I would
like you to tell me -- you stated that at the parish there were many
people.  Did the refugees came in droves?  Did the refugees come in
droves?  I think the Prosecutor even tried to make you give the number
of refugees, and you said “about 1,500.”  Is that correct?
A.   I say -- I said that there were many refugees in that church, but the
figure of 1,900 said by the interpreter that you just suggested, I
don't think that's the figure I gave.  I said there were between 2,000
and 5,000 people.
Q.   At what point in time between the day you arrived there and the time
of the first attack did the number amount to that, or was it when you
arrived at the church that you realised that there were that many
people?
A.   When I arrived at the church, there were many people because the
refugees started flocking in since Sunday.  I arrived on Tuesday, and
from -- when I say the number had increased, so the number kept
mounting from the time that I arrived at the church.
Q.   So, from that Wednesday, just like that, without any accuracy you
were able to estimate the number to be 2,000, 3,000 refugees?
A.   If I can reckon it, I think there were more than 2,000 of us on
Wednesday.  I think there were more than 2,000 of us, because when I
got there on Tuesday, people were lying down inside the church, and
the church was full; and at a certain point when you went outside,
there were even more people.
Q.   Thank you.  You stated that in spite of -- that many people -- the
gendarmes were stopping you from going to get vittels from the shops.
A.   Yes, nobody could move.  We had to remain on the spot.  We had to
remain within the courtyard of the church.  We were not allowed to go
out and buy supplies.
Q.   Where were you positioned, precisely?  Was it directly in front of
the church?
A.   We were all of us within the courtyard.  I told you that there were
two courtyards.  The front courtyard, where the men -- was where the
men were sitting.  There was another courtyard by the side where the
women were sitting.  So there were many courtyards.  We used to go
into the church in order to run away from the wind that was blowing,
because it was cold because of the wind-chill factor, and we went
inside the church in order to get shelter from the wind.
Q.   And where were the assailants?
A.   I told you that the attackers were in the small business centre of Ku
Ishusho.  You saw the main road.  When they came, they gathered there.
Even the vehicles in which they came left them in that small business
centre.  So before the attack, they encircled the premises of the
church, be it inside or outside of the parish premises.  And this is
what I explained before.
Q.   Do you mean that, on the one hand, you had the assailants who were
surrounding you and, on the other, you had the gendarmes who were
there and who were supposed to protect you, but who were stopping you
from going out or from leaving the crowd that you constituted?  Is
that how things were?
A.   Well, I would say that the gendarmes were not guarding the refugees,
they also were surrounding us, in my opinion.  They too were
surrounding us because if they had been guarding us, they would have
protected us against those assailants.  They, therefore, were not
there to protect us.  They were probably waiting for the church (sic)
to come so that they could kill us, and that is probably why they were
stopping us leaving the place to go and buy bread for our children.
Q.   I think I read somewhere that anybody who tried to leave the place --
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, if my friend is referring to the statements of the
witness, perhaps he should tell us which statements and where.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, I will do that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good, Counsel.
MR. POGNON:
I will stand corrected here.  Apparently I am a bit confused in my
mind.  Yes, I can find my way already.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   I was referring to the statement of 15 November 1995, reference in
manuscript 2363, document K0023122, but the page is page 6, K0027 --
, and I will read the name.  Are you at that page, that is, page
of the statement of 15 November 1995, K0023127?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
MR. POGNON:
Yes, Madam President; yes.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   "Question" -- and it's at the middle of the page.  "Were you allowed
to leave the church?"
"No, the church was surrounded by gendarmes.  I recall that a young
man whose name was Muhimbirwa was killed by gunshot after he left the
church."
Did you make statement?
A.   On that point, I would say that that Muhimbirwa was a young man who
used to run a small business in the business centre; he used to live
near the main road.  So he jumped and passed through the bamboos that
were quite close, and he got to his house.  And when he got out of the
premises, he was killed outside the parish.  So as soon as he got out
of the parish and got to the road, he was killed there.  But that
wasn't on the day of the massacre, that happened on a different day.
It wasn't on Friday when the massacres took place but -- actually, the
so-called Muhimbirwa was killed, but not during the day of the
massacres.
Q.   Was it during the period when you were already forbidden from getting
out?
A.   Yes, it was during that period.  But he hid himself, and since he was
living close to the parish, he took advantage of the inattention of
the gendarmes to go to his house, because he was living at the small
business centre of Nyange.  He was living at the corner below the
church, so he got down via a bamboo bush to go to his house and he met
people and he was killed by them.
Q.   Under what circumstances, therefore, were you able to send a
delegation to go and ask for food from Father Seromba?
A.   I wouldn't say I sent a delegation, but refugees requested for food
from Father Seromba, those who were in the courtyard.  Seromba himself
was present and since there were foodstuffs sent by Caritas to assist
the needy, in particular, there was maize, and since there were people
who had fled to that place since Sunday, there were people who were
already dying of famine, especially women and children.  So there were
teachers who asked for food from Father Seromba so that people could
eat.  Seromba refused and said that there was no food to be given to
the Inyenzi Tutsi.
So when we got that reply, we tried to go to the banana grove of the
fathers, and that is where we went to harvest some bananas.  By the
way, they were not plantains but bananas that were used to make beer.
But when he saw smoke going up, that is when he came and told the
gendarmes saying that there was still -- that if there is still --
that there are still Tutsis going into the banana grove and the
gendarmes should shoot them.  So we didn't send a delegation as such.
They took the initiative of their own volition to talk to Father
Seromba.  We didn't ask anybody to go and ask for foods, people took
the initiative themselves.
Q.   Thank you.  So on page K0135207, when your statement was taken down --
and we are at the last third of the page, when your statement was
taken as follows, and I am reading it:  "On the day following my
arrival, we delegated a group of teachers to go and meet Father
Seromba in order to ask for food from him for the many refugees, in
particular, for the children."  So when your statement was reported in
those terms, that is not exactly the same thing.  You didn't send a
delegation to Father Seromba.
A.   No, we never sent a delegation.  The teachers who were with us went
and they felt and took the initiative to talk to the father.  I
believe the investigators did not take down my statements accurately
or in the way that I stated it.
Q.   By the same token, when it is written here reporting what you stated
-- what you allegedly stated, that is, the teacher, Rutegesha, was
leading the entire -- that is, the entire delegation that met Father
Seromba, and the entire delegation was killed, when this was said was
your statement distorted?
A.   No, when those people went and talked to Father Seromba, he was
present on the spot.  He was seeing the condition of the refugees.  It
was close to his house.  I myself was near them.  We, therefore, did
not hold a meeting to choose people who would go and represent us.  I
don't know.  I think they did not write down my statement correctly.
Those people talked to the priest, and I was hearing them because I
was close to them.  Nobody, therefore, delegated those teachers.  We
were all there, and we were all present in the courtyard.
Q.   Thank you.  So you were surrounded; on the one hand, there were the
assailants, on the other, the gendarmes were stopping you from getting
out and who were immobilising where you were.  How were you able to
climb the barriers, or to go through the barriers to get to the banana
grove of the parish?
A.   Yes, the banana grove was near the courtyard in which we were.  The
banana plantation wasn't outside the premises, it was within.  There
was a small path which led to the outside, and so there was a banana
grove and public latrine for students.  So it was quite close to the
courtyard in which we were.
Even those who used to work at the banana grove had to pass through
the location where we were.  The gendarmes, therefore, were stopping
us from taking the small pathways to try to go outside.  The banana
grove, therefore, was just close to the courtyard in which we were
gathered.  The gendarmes were, therefore, not guarding us from the
banana side because there was no exit to the outside.
Q.   Now, talking about the banana grove, let's try to situate ourselves
vis-à-vis the church.  Is it to the right where you take the main road
and that you are facing the main entrance or the main door of the
church?  On which side is the banana grove?  Where exactly is the
banana grove?
A.   When you get -- enter through the main, the big gate or door that we
saw on the picture, the banana plantation is at the far end of the
church.  When you see the church tower, you go to the right and you
get into the banana grove.  There was another banana grove that was on
the left side, but that one was too far and we couldn't have access to
it because that banana grove to the left was too far from us.  But the
one I am referring to is one that is close to the students' latrine,
which is just close to the presbytery.
Q.   How many metres, approximately, from the church around which you had
gathered was it?
A.   Probably you could, rather, ask me how many metres there were between
the courtyard of the church and the banana plantation.  The border or
the boundary -- between the boundary of the courtyard and the banana
plantation, you can't count up to 15 metres, that is, less than 15
metres separate the border of the courtyard and the banana plantation.
That is -- but I think there is a short distance between the edge of
the church and the church.  So between the church -- or, rather, the
banana grove was somewhat behind.  The church is in front, whereas the
banana grove is somewhat behind the church.  Beside there was a house
that is the meeting room.  So, the banana grove is near the courtyard
of that meeting room.  Otherwise, between the courtyard and the banana
grove, you have less than 15 metres; in fact, the distance is not very
far.
Q.   Thank you.  And you submit, or you contend that you saw Father
Seromba, who told the gendarmes "to shoot at any Inyenzi who would be
harvesting bananas."
A.   Yes, I confirm that.  He found us on the spot trying to roast
bananas.  He came to see us when he saw the smoke going up.  He talked
to the gendarmes, and when he talked to them, I was there and I heard
them, and, indeed, nobody amongst us went to the banana grove any
more.
Q.   Fine.  Weren't the gendarmes instead -- who, in order to keep you
together, stopped you from harvesting the bananas and from dispersing?
A.   No, those gendarmes, at a certain point, realised that we were
roasting bananas, but they never knew when we had harvested them.  The
father, on his part, came, and when he saw smoke going up where we
were -- well, where we were wasn't far because it was in the courtyard
of the parish.
Q.   At what time of the day was it?
MR. POGNON:
I am sorry, interpreters, I didn't get you.
THE WITNESS:
I did not have a watch, but I think that the time was approximately 11
o'clock, because when the teachers went to ask him for food, it was a
bit earlier.  But as for the time exactly when we roasted the bananas,
I can't say it, but it was definitely before 12 midday.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   So, what you mean is that Father Seromba at about, let's say, 10 to
o'clock was outside where you were -- you the refugees were, and
that at about 11 or 12 midday he was still there or that he had come --
that he had come back.
A.   No, he didn't go anywhere.  He didn't have any other thing to do.  He
was at his home.  He would come out and -- I mean, we were in his
courtyard, we were on his property.  I can't say that he stayed inside
the house throughout the day.  I said he found us on the spot and made
the statement.  And later, nobody went into his banana plantation
again.  Even the next day, no one returned to the banana plantation,
nobody dared go back to the banana plantation.
Q.   Yes, in any case, you were so threatened, according to what you said,
by the assailants and the gendarmes that they wouldn't risk their
lives.  That is what you stated.
A.   I did not understand the question.  You made mention to gendarmes and
people who were there.  Could you please clarify further by repeating
the question?
Q.   You stated that had no one went back to that banana plantation, and I
agreed with you that you were so threatened by the gendarmes and the
assailants that you had to stay put.
MS. ALEXIS:
If the counsel --
MR. POGNON:
(No interpretation)
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, wait a minute.
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MS. ALEXIS:
If counsel is putting to the witness what the witness said, counsel
should be careful to faithfully represent exactly what the witness
said because, in my view, the twist that has been placed on the words
of the witness is not, in fact, what the witness said.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I believe we are making progress with this witness
together.  There is no problem.
You say that the people at Father Seromba's presbytery were threatened
by gendarmes and no one could go back to the banana plantation.  I
wanted us to agree with him, and I said they were threatened so much
by the gendarmes and the assailants that they couldn't go anywhere
else, and that was all.  I didn't expect him to say yes or no; I just
wanted to agree with him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, that was not a question, but a conclusion you had drawn.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I am trying to be as convivial with this witness as
possible so that he should be at ease.  This is my manner of examining
-- or cross-examining the witness.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Witness --
A.   I am listening, Counsel.
Q.   If I put it to you that you stated -- and I am rephrasing my question
-- you stated that -- you stated a while ago that there were two
banana plantations in the parish.  Do you confirm that?
A.   Yes, I confirm that.  Even at the moment, those banana plantations
exist at the same location -- they are not at the same location; they
are at two different locations.
Q.   If I were to put it to you that at the time of the events, there was
only banana plantation in the parish at a location called Rugabano,
what would you say to that?
A.   Yes, I know that area.  I know the place called Rugabano; there is a
banana plantation there.  But above the latrines of the priest,
there's another banana plantation.  Those two banana plantations exist
even today.  Those do not date back to recent times.  Even Father
Seromba met those banana plantations there.  They have been there for
a very long time.
Q.   Let us take it that our opinions on this matter are divergent, and we
of the Defence believe there's only one banana plantation.
MS. ALEXIS:
Counsel…(Microphones overlapping)
THE WITNESS:
And I confirm that there are two banana plantations.  I can swear
that, even today at the Nyange parish, you will find two banana
plantations.  Those two banana plantations are close to the courtyard
of the presbytery, and that was where we had the said bananas.  And
even in the direction of the area when I was moving to the church at
the presbytery, that banana plantation which is near the school and
the latrines is one; there's another banana plantation at Rugabano.  I
confirm that the other banana plantation does exist; however, in the
parish, the Rugabano plantation is very far from the parish.  The
banana plantation where we harvested those bananas is close to the
church opposite the area where the school latrine was.  That banana
plantation wasn't planted recently; it has existed for a very long
time.  But I confirm that there are two banana plantations.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, do you want to say something?
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, Madam President.  I was waiting for the witness to finish his
answer.
Madam President, the Court has told Counsel Pognon, my learned friend,
that he has to confine his cross-examination to questions.
Notwithstanding this, Counsel's Pognon, perhaps in the spirit of
conviviality, as he has so kindly told the Court, continues to make
comments which are, in fact, conclusions.  I would like at this
juncture to strongly object to these comments.  These comments are, in
fact, comments which are actually conclusions based on the evidence.
And this is the sole precinct of the Trial Chamber, and it is not for
counsel in his cross-examination to make these conclusions for the
Trial Chamber, and I so place on record.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.  Madam, President, I don't know how what I say is
shocking.  I have a divergence -- we have divergent views, and the
witness confirms his position, which is different from mine, and the
proceedings continue.  I don't see where I am making comments.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you concluded a while ago that there was only one banana
plantation, and I think this is what poses a problem.  I told you, by
the way, that you were drawing conclusions.  What you should do is to
put questions to the witness, wait for his answer, and we will make
our findings later, because we are following the debate and we are
perfectly aware of what is happening.
MR. POGNON:
I thank you, Madam President, and I will try to abide by the wishes of
my learned friend.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Do you think Father Seromba can give orders to gendarmes?
A.   I believe he was in a position to give them orders.  We arrived; we
found gendarmes.  Were those gendarmes protecting the priest in
question, or what were the circumstances that brought the gendarmes to
the church?  We observed that they were protecting Father Seromba, as
a matter of fact, so you can understand the situation.  When someone
is in your home, you can always speak to him and tell him what you
wish.  I don't understand why those gendarmes were appointed, not to
the commune office, but to the priest.  Perhaps he is in a position to
better explain matters and explain why those gendarmes got there.
We went to seek refuge at the church, as we had done in the past.  But
when we got to the scene, we found gendarmes there.  To our mind, as
far as we the refugees were concerned, we thought they were there to
provide for safety, for security.  But we subsequently realised that
the place was not safe.
I don't know whether that question can be put to Father Seromba as
regards the presence of those gendarmes in his premises, how they got
there, and how they stayed there for very long.  Were they there to
protect the refugees?  Were the refugees in question, Seromba?  What
we observed was that we were -- people were killed in that location by
the persons who were supposed to be protecting us.  That is all I can
say by way of an answer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, try to be brief and concise.
MR. POGNON:
I thank you.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   But you have not answered my question.  Do you think that a civilian,
even the owner of something, can give orders to someone to kill.  Can
Seromba order a gendarme?  Is he in a position to order a gendarme to
shoot at someone?  Is he in a position to do so?  Please, be brief in
your answer.  If you think he is in a position to do so, say so; if
you think he is not in a position to do so, say so as well.
A.   Regarding this point, I would say that he was in his house; he had
the authority.  When you are in your home, you have authority.  He
could have said, "Don't touch those people, leave them alone."  He
could have done so.  Even if they were not to obey him, he could have
said so.  If we had observed that he tried to protect us but he hadn't
succeeded, that would have been something.  We didn't see such a
gesture being made.
Q.   Since you are educated, we have the decree of the 23rd of January
establishing the gendarmerie.  This decree stipulates and --
prescribes rather, prescribes the -- defines the relationship between
administrative authorities that are in charge of public order.  And
article 37 of that provision, of that decree, states that the
administrative authority, the authority of the national gendarmerie,
has to disclose information regarding public orders and which can give
rise to precautionary measures or punitive measures.  Each gendarmerie
authority draws up regular reports with the administrative authority.
We are dealing with public order.  We are dealing with public order.
Public order was disrupted by assailants who were threatening
refugees.  Do you agree with me that the only authority that was in a
position to resolve that problem of public order was the
administrative authority, that is, the bourgmestre working with
cooperation with the gendarmerie?
A.   Yes, I agree with you as regards public order.  As a matter of fact,
public order falls under the ambit of other persons who were
responsible thereof.  But what I state is this:  Father Seromba was
someone who was highly respected; he was influential.  We had come to
seek refuge on his premises.  When he saw people coming to kill us,
even before they killed us, he could have spoken to the authorities.
The communal office was close to the parish.  He was someone who could
give instructions, who could speak on our behalf to the bourgmestre
and tell him that the refugees on the premises could be protected by
the authorities.
As far as I am concerned, if he had had courage to speak to the
authorities as someone who could represent all those people, it could
have been done with a view to protecting people.  Even if he were to
utter just one word and try to contribute by making suggestions, we
could have seen him acting in that vein.  And I think this is all I
have to say.
Q.   In your opinion -- in your opinion, how come gendarmes found
themselves at the parish?
A.   I do not know.  All I can say is that I found them there when I went
to seek refuge there.
Q.   I thank you.
(No interpretation)...DK027124, page 1286 bis.  This is the
information you provide.  “As one of the gendarmes, why they were not
protecting us…”  And this was his answer.  You say that the bullets
they had in their possession had to be used for their own protection
and not for that of others.  Did you make that statement?
A.   Even today in my statement, I make that statement.  We asked them to
protect us, and they told us that the bullets they had in their
possession were meant for protecting themselves and not for protecting
us.
Q.   I thank you.  You also stated, still in that statement of the 2nd of
February, we are on page 027 -- I beg your pardon, it's rather
, 1224 bis.  That is the page.  Slightly near the top of the
page.  “As regards the former bourgmestre, Ndindiliyimana, I can tell
you that as far as I can remember he arrived at the church on the
Thursday on board the same vehicle described awhile ago.”  And if we
turn to the same unredacted statement, because there is something
missing there, you stated -- it is the same statement that is the
unredacted transcript.  The K number, it's of 2nd February, same as
the one -- it doesn't have a cover page.  It is from 2348 to 2344,
page 2346, K026099.  “As regards the former bourgmestre, I remember
that he got to the church on the Thursday.  He arrived in the vehicle
I made mention of.  He was accompanied by A, one, Kayishema, Fulgence,
police inspector; police brigadier Mbakirirehe; and Nishirimbere,
Aloys, police officer.”  Did you make that statement?  Did you make
that statement?
A.   You made mention of Aloys Nishirimbere.  He was not among those
people.  What I said was there was a bourgmestre, Muhimbirwa, a person
called Kayishema, and Kanyarukiga.  There was also Télespore Ndungutse
and Athanase Seromba.  Those people came to Seromba's house on that
Thursday, and that is why I said I believed they were holding a
meeting, at least it looked like a meeting which they were holding.  I
stated that when those people left that place on the Friday, Fulgence
Kayishema, that is the police inspector, returned in the evening, and
he took out the Hutu women whom I mentioned were inside the church,
and those women were married to Tutsi men.  So he went away with those
women.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, please try to answer the question without elaborating.   Try
to answer the questions as concisely as possible.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Let me repeat my question:  You stated that -- on the 2nd of February
, in answer to a question that was put to you, that, "As regards
the former bourgmestre, Ndindiliyimana, I remember that he arrived in
the church on a Thursday.  He arrived in the vehicle I have just
talked about in the company of A, one, Kayishema, Fulgence, police
inspector, A, two, Mbakirirehe, brigadier; A, 3, Nishirimbere, Aloys,
police officer."  Did you make that statement?  This is all I want to
know.
A.   I made that statement but I did not include Nishirimbere, the person
called Nishirimbere.  I believe I told you that I subsequently heard
that he hadn't come to the church.  He was, instead, in the commune
office.  I believe that question was put to me before.
Q.   It was asked before and you answered.
So the bourgmestre arrived on the scene.  On that scene -- on the
scene, were there gendarmes?  Did the bourgmestre come with police?
Did you think the presence of the bourgmestre, the presence of
gendarmes, normally, should have represented the presence of the
authorities who were in a position to find a solution to the public
unrest?
A.   Those were actually the people who were supposed to find the
solution.
Q.   I thank you.  I now come to one part of your statement in which you
explained, in answer to a question put to you by the Prosecutor, and
which is problematic as far as the Defence is concerned -- but before
we get there, if you please, regarding the answer you have just given,
that is, that it was those persons, those administrative and military
authorities who were in a position to put an end to the disturbance,
to the public disturbances.  Do you think it is necessary for those
people to consult with one another, to consult with Father Seromba
before doing their work, which from the legal standpoint is to put an
end to any disturbance, any public disturbances?
A.   I think it was necessary because they came and they spoke with Father
Seromba.
Q.   I thank you for your answer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, before going into another line of questioning, we want to
draw your attention to the fact that it is now 12:30 p.m..  It is time
for the lunch break.  Do you have many other questions for this
witness?
MR. POGNON:
Yes, I have a series of questions.  I have a series of questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, then, we are going to adjourn and resume at 2:30 p.m.  I thank
you all.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The court stands adjourned.
(Court recessed at 1230H)
(Pages 22 to 32 by Judith Baverstock)
(Court resumed at 1433H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Pognon, you have the floor.
MR. POGNON:
Most obliged, Madam President, Your Honours.  I also wish you good
afternoon.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Good afternoon, Witness.
A.   Good afternoon, Counsel.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I think the first thing that Defence wishes to do is
to tender the document which is a decree of 23 January 1974 on the
creation and organisation of the gendarmerie which I have read
beforehand.
If the registry would be so kind as to come and get it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have the document, and it should be Defence Exhibit D. 18, if the
Prosecution has no objection.  No objection, Madam Prosecutor?
MS. ALEXIS:
That is true, Madam President, no objections.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, there is a second document to organisation communes,
which is a little thicker, and which I have handed over to registry,
and registry's photocopying it.  When the document will be ready, we
shall also seek to tender it as an exhibit.  This is the decree to
organise communes.  In the meantime, with your leave --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the decree of 23 January 1974 is entered and admitted as exhibit
for the Defence, D. No. 18.  You may proceed, Counsel.
(Exhibit No. D. 18 admitted)
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Witness CBS, I shall proceed with reading the transcripts of your
statements, and I am now looking at the transcript of 12th March 2003.
This is on page K0262138.  I shall read, and I think it is somewhere
in the middle of the page.  And I read as follows, "I never saw Father
Seromba come to count the Tutsis who had come to seek refuge in the
church.  There were too many of us, and it would have been difficult
for anyone to count us."  Is this sentence -- does this sentence come
from you?
A.   I think that you began in the middle.  If you began a little earlier,
I would know who it is who interviewed me, because you will see that
there was somebody who came to count the Tutsis who were there.
Q.   One moment.  One moment.  Actually, this is the sentence which you
gave in answer to the question that follows, that is, after saying
that Aloys was not amongst the attackers.  So this is the sentence
that followed.  I do not know whether it was a question that was put
to you.  I think it is a statement that you made to supplement what
you had already said.  If you wish, I will read the first sentence
that you said after "Aloys".  Do you wish to -- do you wish me to read
it out to you in its entirety?
A.   Begin with the previous sentence.  If necessary, you may read the
entire statement.
Q.   I shall begin with the preceding sentence, which is this: "After
listening to the rereading of my statements, I wish to remove the name
of Aloys Nyishirembere (phonetic) from the list of genocidaires.  I
had identified him as genocidaire in my statements of 1996.
I mistakenly had included Aloys amongst the attackers because I
participated in the attacks.  In talking with people, I learned that
Aloys had not participated in the killings at the church.  This is why
today I am deleting him from the list.  I saw the policeman in uniform
and I thought that he was amongst them."
That is the preceding sentence.  The second one, that is the one I
read to you before, follows.  "I never saw Father Seromba coming to
count the Tutsis who had sought refuge in the church.  There were very
many of us, and it would have been difficult for anyone to count us."
A.   I said that I did not see him to come to count people and I said that
it was difficult to count people, the people who were there.  I
acknowledge it.  I said it.
Q.   So it is only this sentence that I wish you to give an opinion on.
Thank you.  In the same vein still, I shall now go to the very first
statement of the 15th of November 1995.  This is on page K0023127.  It
is in the middle of the page.  A question was put to you as follows.
Question: "Was there someone who counted the people in this church?"
And your answer is this: "To the best of my knowledge, no one."  Does
this sentence reflect what you said?
A.   To say that someone came to count people in the church would, I
think, in my view, be confusing -- this sentence, or the meaning of
this sentence -- with my statement in which I said someone came to
remove people from the church.  I do not think anybody came to count
people in the church.  I said that a judicial police inspector came to
remove some people from the church.
Q.   Thank you.  Thank you.  So nobody came to count.  I shall now come to
the statement of the 12th of March 2003.  This is the page -- at the
bottom of the page which is K0262138.  You stated -- there's no need
for me to read it; it's quite short.  You said that you know Father
Nturiye, that he did not live in Nyange, that he came to live in
Nyange during the genocide.  And you say that it is during the attacks
that a bus came and that he came to Nyange at that time.  You also
said that you did not see him during the attacks.  That is the
substance of your statement.  Did you state this?
A.   That is not what I stated.  My words have been twisted.
Q.   Do you wish me to read the sentence out to you?
A.   I wish to tell you how I said it.  I would like to explain it.  I
stated that this Father Nturiye did not live at that place; he lived
elsewhere.  But on that Friday, he came to that place and I saw him.
However, people say -- those who were present said that a bus came
quite close to the church and that these people came down from this
bus and that on board this bus there were Interahamwe.  Father Nturiye
came.  I saw him on that Friday, and it is on that same day that he
arrived at the scene.  To say that he came and spent some days, I
didn't say that.
Q.   I think that it is the translation from French to Kinyarwanda which
did not work.  I did not tell you that he came to spend some days.  I
shall read the sentence, which is very short, so that there is no
ambiguity.  I'm going to read the sentence which reports what you
said.  Do you agree with that?
"I know Father Nturiye.  He did not live here, but he came to live
here during the genocide.  During the attacks, a bus came, and I think
that he arrived Nyange at that time.  I did not see him during the
attacks."  This is a written form of what you said to the
investigators; is that correct?
A.   That is correct.  This bus did arrive on that day, the day we were
attacked.  At the time when we were attacked, he came on board this
bus, and he went to his fellow priests' house.
Q.   What you are saying here -- sorry, I'll change the question.  When
did the bus arrive?
A.   It is during the hours when we were being attacked.  People had
gathered, and it is said that a bus came from Gisenyi and Father
Nturiye came down from this bus.  I saw him when he was entering the
presbytery.  It was on that Friday, indeed.  He was accompanied by
Kayiranga.  They came together on board that bus.  This means,
therefore, that when the killing began, when the confrontation
started, he was already on site, because when people were killed, this
priest had already arrived at the presbytery.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, please answer concisely to the questions.  Listen carefully
to the questions and give simple answers to the question.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  That is how I witnessed the events.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   But you have not yet answered the question about the time when the
bus arrived.  When did the bus arrive?  Give the time.
A.   I told you that the fighting began between nine and ten o'clock.
This did not reach eleven o'clock.  We were attacked after the arrival
of these priests, after the arrival of this bus.  I explained that I
did not see the bus, but these priests entered the presbytery at the
time when the attack, or the fighting, was beginning.
Q.   Where were you when you saw them?
A.   I was in the courtyard in front of the church, at the side where the
women were sitting.  When you pass along that road, you would enter
through the other side there.
Q.   Thank you.  I suppose the same answer would apply to Father
Kayiranga.  You said this -- this is the following sentence: "I know
Father Kayiranga.  He came to Nyange with Father Nturiye.  I did not
see him carrying any weapon.  When they arrived, both priests went
into Father Seromba's house.  Did I not see them come out of the
presbytery.  I saw them with the other priests on the balcony of the
presbytery, but they never came amongst the refugees, as Father
Seromba did."  Is this sentence an accurate reflection of what you
said to the investigators?
A.   This is a faithful rendition of what I said.  I did make this
statement.
Q.   Thank you.  I would like to recall here to you, for your benefit, did
you give testimony in the Kibuye trial?
A.   Yes, I went to Kibuye.
Q.   Were you interviewed by a police officer during the Kibuye trial?
A.   No, because -- I can give you further explanations if you put more
questions to me.
Q.   Please answer the question.  Did you at some point go to the police
station as a plaintiff or as a complainant in the Kibuye trial to
complain against a list of persons whose names I cannot list here for
safety reasons.  Were you a plaintiff in this Kibuye trial?
A.   I was one of those who gave testimony, and you have asked me
questions regarding my testimony, that is, the coming of these
priests.  Apart from that, no employee of the tribunal asked me any
questions.  What I did was that I made a written statement and I said
how I saw the presence of these priests.  Apart from that, I was not a
party in the trial.
Q.   Very well.  Do you remember exactly the date on which you were
interviewed by an officer, a judicial police inspector, in connection
with this trial?
A.   No, I do not remember the dates of the trial and no judicial police
inspector questioned me.  All I did was make this statement and I went
back home.
Q.   What statement did you make?
A.   It is that statement according to which I saw those persons at the
presbytery and I knew these persons.  They came during the massacres.
I said how those persons came to the parish that Friday.  Well, it's
been a long time.  I didn't lay any complaint against them to the
tribunal.  It's been a long time.  I never saw a copy of their
proceedings.  I didn't have any interest in that case.  The only thing
is that I explained how they came to the location on board that bus
and in which you had Interahamwe.  I think that is the explanation I
gave.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, the Defence, following the requests made by the
Prosecutor -- the Defence therefore has been able to obtain a copy of
the transcripts of the interview of CBS appearing as a plaintiff.
We have it only in Kinyarwanda, and I would like to express the wish
that this should be given to the interpreters so that they can read it
as and where necessary.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, can you show us that document.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, if it is the same document, I believe this was the
document that was translated.  I could be wrong, but I think perhaps
it was translated yesterday morning.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, it is not a document that was translated.  We have
two documents.  One was translated yesterday, and that is not the
document.  I will come subsequently to the document that was
translated, but this one, we obtained it through the Rwandan justice
services, through relations there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to show these transcripts to the various parties and to
the interpreters.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is not speaking through a microphone.
MS. ALEXIS:
(Microphones overlapping)...yesterday.
MR. POGNON:
I have just been told that it is a document that was translated
yesterday morning, but that one, we got it using our own means.  That
is why it doesn't bear the references of the office of the public
prosecutor.  I have the transcript that was given to us.  It is in
very fine print, and I was unable to read the transcript, given my
age, especially as it was given to us marked "draft".  So I have
problems reading this transcript.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I suppose you know the contents thereof and that you may ask
questions on the basis of that.
Can you please show the document to the witness, please.
Counsel, we would like to point out to you that there's lots of idle
time.
MR. POGNON:
Well, it's a document that was translated.  And the one I've given you
in Kinyarwanda, I will try to read it, to read what Witness CBS says
in Kibuye.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you want to read the entire document or just what you are
interested in?
MR. POGNON:
Well, I will merely read what is of interest to us, that is where he
mentions the transcripts and/or what gives us indications about the
transcripts and what he said.  Well, it is a transcript
/D197MNS1996, 14 September, appearing before us.  I can't quite read
the name -- the police judicial inspector with jurisdiction in the
Kibuye préfecture.
"Question:  Talk to us about your problem.  Answer:  I am accusing
Kayiranga.  On the night of the 11 April 1994, when they attacked our
place, we found -- or took refuge at the church because we ourselves,
in 1990, that is where we had had our lives safe.  He came on the 13th
of April and found us in the church where we had spent the night.  I
am talking about François Kayiranga, Emmanuel, and we at that moment,
at that time, we did not know where he was working.  He came to visit
us, to visit the refugees on the next day, 14 April 1994."
There's a portion that is not legible.  "He started asking us for
money so that he could go and buy some maize for us because the
children had already begun to be hungry.  Each refugee who was at the
church gave money, depending on his means."  Can I stop reading here?
This document does exist.  And the charges are continued in respect of
the 15th April.
Mr. Witness, this document mentions your name, talks about your
family, indicates your place of residence, and bears your signature.
Do you acknowledge that this document reflects a statement that you
made before the police, as a plaintiff, which is in conflict with what
you stated in the transcripts and which I have just read to you.  That
is the transcript of 2003.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Has the witness said something?  We did not hear the translation
thereof.
THE WITNESS:
This document, I don't agree with this document when it says that on
the 11th Kayiranga came and killed people at our place.  It is not
Kayiranga who came and killed people at our place.  I said that
Kayiranga came on the 15th, and that is when I saw him.  So the dates
do not tally.  And, besides, the document that I brought, that is not
a document that was written or drawn up by the judicial police
inspector.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I would like that this document be entered --
admitted and entered as Defence exhibit, and the reference be D. 19.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have any objection to that?
MS. ALEXIS:
No, please, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document is admitted as a Defence exhibit and referenced D. 19.
Only, we would like to have the French version of the transcripts for
the purpose of the file because what you have there is in Kinyarwanda.
We will put D. 19(K) and probably D. 19(F) for the French copy.
(Exhibit No. D. 19(K) and D. 19(F) admitted)
MR. POGNON:
I don't know if the registry will see to the translation of the
document because we only have a single copy.  So would the registry be
so kind as to xerox it and bring it back to us.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, your microphone, please.  Thank you.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Witness CBS, I have just read that document therefore.  I am going to
read what concerns you in the decision that was taken in Kibuye in the
same case, about the ruling that was rendered in Kibuye in the same
case, because you are not the only one who later complained.  Many
people launched a complaint.  It is a prosecution document, and it is
a judgement, the judgement of Kibuye, and it is Exhibit K02 -- 3392;
its manuscript number 1559 bis.  That is a document of Kibuye, the
Kibuye document, and that is the Exhibit D. 9 that we had already
tendered.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The document he mentioned before was K03392.
MR. POGNON:
We are on page 0334004, manuscript 1554 (sic) bis, and it is at the
bottom of the page, I am reading it.  "Whereas" -- I am sorry, please
expunge what I have just read out from the records.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name that has just been read out should be stricken from the
records.
MR. POGNON:
Whereas CBS states that he saw the name I've just mentioned -- unless
we have to go into closed session.
"On the 14th of April 1994, the date on which he told them to give him
money so that he can go and buy foods supplies but that he didn't
bring back anything to them and that they saw him again on the 15th of
April, at a time when he was striving to alight from the vehicle."
That is the last sentence of the page that I just mentioned and which
continues on the next page.  I would like to tender this document.
This document has already been tendered, and I would like this page to
be mentioned as having been cited during the cross-examination of
Witness CBS.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection?
This document has already been entered, admitted into the records.
MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you, Madam President.  We have no objections.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you.  Madam President, I wish to conclude by tendering exhibits.
The first is an exhibit that I had served notice that I would be
tendering, and that is the decree to organise the communal services.
This morning, while we were talking about the gendarmerie and the
bourgmestre -- and this is a document that establishes the
relationship between those state institutions.  I shall therefore add
the decree to communal services.  It is a law, a basic provision of 23
November 1963.  We would like this document to be entered as Defence
Exhibit D. 20.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Prosecution?
MS. ALEXIS:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document is entered as Defence Exhibit D. 20.
(Exhibit No. D. 20 admitted)
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, before tendering that
document, I would like to ask the witness a couple of questions.  If
he can provide us with quick answers, this would be good.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.   Witness CBS, do you know what were the results of the trial, the
conclusion of the trial of the priests that we have been talking
about?
A.   No, I don't know what became of it.
Q.   Are you aware that in the court of first instance they were given the
death sentence?
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, might I object.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Attendez, Monsieur Témion.
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, the witness said categorically that he does not know,
so I fail to see the relevance of the questions that my learned friend
now proposes to ask the witness.
MR. POGNON:
It has been proven on the basis of authentic documents that CBS was a
plaintiff.
THE WITNESS:
I was called as a witness.  I wasn't a plaintiff.  I wasn't the
complaining party -- or party that lodged complaint.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are wondering, because the witness says he is not aware of
what became of the complaint that he filed.  Now, would he be able to
say something about that?  Don't you think that these are issues that
you can develop in your closing arguments?
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I will stick to what he said.  I merely would wish --
or have just tendered the judgement on No. D. 10 -- D. 9.  I would
like, having been able to obtain the judgement of the court of appeal
of Ruhengeri, that we give this document to the interpreters so that
they can read the page that I am going to indicate, since this
judgement is a judgement of -- the judgement of acquittal of the
priests in question.
So if it will so please the Chamber, the registry official can come
and take this judgement of the Ruhengeri court of appeal, which gave
the judgement of acquittal of the priests.
Unfortunately, we have this document only in Kinyarwanda.
(Pages 33 to 41 by S. Eboe-Osuji)
H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon, as far as I am concerned, we are not opposed to your --
to your tendering -- anyway, entering this document into the record,
but do you want the entire judgement to be read or you want to enter --
MR. POGNON:
Actually, it's in Kinyarwanda.  It's in Kinyarwanda.  It will be very
long for it to be translated.  I show the page that requires
translation.  There are only two whereases to be read, and I'll give
the reference of the judgement so that it can be indicated.
I believe there's an objection from the Prosecution.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. ALEXIS:
It is not properly an objection.  It's just that I'm looking at the
documents that we have, and I haven't seen the document that counsel
is intending to admit, but as far as I can see from my records, it
appears that this document has been already translated into French and
that it was disclosed to the Defence on the 31st of August, if it is
the same document that I -- that counsel is trying to admit into
evidence.
And I would say as well, Madam President, that whilst we have no
objections in principle to this document being admitted, we would ask
that the entire document be admitted and not those portions that
should please counsel, but that all of the document is relevant.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I think I said here that I am going to tender the
judgement of Ruhengeri, and since it's a very big judgement, we are
going to read only two whereas's, and I will conclude my
cross-examination.  On that point, I would also like to say that that
judgement was never disclosed to us.  I am saying this under solemn
declaration that I made a long time ago.  On the contrary, what was
disclosed to us was a report of the legal department of the office of
the public prosecutor of Rwanda.  That is, the office of the public
prosecutor of the court of appeal of Ruhengeri giving a report on the
judgement that was rendered and which is intended for the prosecutor --
which is intended for the public prosecutor of the court of appeal,
and we want to tender it to the Tribunal.  I think that this will
clarify the debate.  Well, the judgement is in Kinyarwanda, and I
think the interpreters will read the portion that I've indicated.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe the interpreters have the document.  Counsel Pognon, could
you please point out the portion that needs to be interpreted?
MR. POGNON:
The interpreters should first of all interpret the highlighted
portions related to the judgement and the reference -- the reference
number at the top, the cause list number, the name of the court and
the judgement per se, as well as the date, and then translate the two
considerations which I have highlighted in yellow.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please refrain from giving the name if you are dealing with protected
persons.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, we may proceed with the interpretation.
Decision number RMP50919/S4/GM/KBY.  On the next line,
RPA34/GC/R1/RUH, page number 1, R.P.014/01/98.  "The Ruhengeri Appeals
Chamber sitting in Ruhengeri in the matter of a genocide and other
crimes against humanity, rendered in public session, the judgement
dated 25 October 2000, the judgement which is as follows."
We shall proceed now to read the two considerations.  These two
whereas's are on page 15 of the judgement.
"The Appeals Chamber finds that the persons who perished at Nyange
church were killed as a result of the negligence of their authorities,
namely, the bourgmestre of Kivumu commune, where the church is
situated, Nyange parish.  This person was sent by the priests on 15
April 1994 to come to the assistance of those people, and he saw 200
bodies of refugees who had just been killed by the Interahamwe, and he
left the scene without having taken measures, likely to protect the
other 1,800 refugees who had sought refuge in the church to ensure
that they would not be killed in turn.  On the contrary, he went and
brought a bulldozer to come and bury the bodies.
"Also finds that the priests had no authority to prevent those
massacres since the civilian and military authorities had been unable
because they realised that the events were beyond them.  Consequently,
it was not the priests in question who were in a position to find a
solution to that problem, that is, to prevent the massacres."
This is the end of the interpretation, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the interpreters.
Counsel Pognon, you have the floor.
MR. POGNON:
I would like this judgement of the Ruhengeri appeals court should be
translated into French by the registry, if possible, and that it
should be tendered as Exhibit D. 21, barring an objection by the
Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, do you want to raise any objections?
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, we do not raise any objections; however, I have been
waiting for an opportune moment to make an application, and perhaps
now would be a good one.
Having regard to these documents that the Defence have in their
possession and having regard to Rule 67(C) of the rules, the
Prosecutor now puts the Defence on notice that it is our intention to
request to inspect the books, documents, photographs, and other
tangible objects which are within the possession of the Defence.
However, having regard to this particular document, we have no
objections to its being admitted.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank counsel for the Prosecution.
Yes, Counsel Pognon.
MR. POGNON:
My colleague is reading the provision in question.  We have made
mention to exhibits, as well as those from the Prosecutor, and we've
asked that the Prosecutor -- the registry disclose them to the
Prosecutor directly.  We are in open session.  We are cross-examining
the witness on the basis of documents which we have obtained very
painfully, with considerable difficulty, and the Prosecutor
necessarily has copies of those documents.  We have just noticed that
the provision mentioned -- in any case, the Prosecutor does not
object.  I think the provision referred to has to do with someone --
something else apart from the problem in question.
Madam President, I have no further questions in cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  This decision of the Ruhengeri court of appeal is admitted
as D. 21, that is, Defence Exhibit D. 21, and we support the proposal
made, the request made that this document be translated into French as
well as into English by the language services section.
(Exhibit No. D. 21 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have registered the Prosecutor's motion, and we shall respond to it
in due course.  As for now, we have finished with Witness CBS.
Witness, we thank you for coming forward and answering our questions.
We wish you a safe journey back home.  Thank you.
MR. POGNON:
With your leave, Madam President, I thank the witness.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
While the witness is being ushered out, could counsel for the
Prosecution tell us who their next witness will be?
MR. TOWNSEND:
May it please the Trial Chamber.  The next witness the Prosecutor
seeks to call is CBT, Charlie, Bravo, Tango.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Bring in the next witness.
Any problems on the side of the Defence?
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, my colleague Patrice Monthé was supposed to take this
witness, but he has -- he has a minor health emergency or a minor call
of nature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In the meantime, we could see who the next witness will be.  Is it
CDK, Mr. Prosecutor?
MR. TOWNSEND:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Pognon?
MR. POGNON:
CDK or CBK?
MR. TOWNSEND:
The witness on the stand is CBT, Charlie, Bravo, Tango.  The following
witness after this one would be Charlie, Delta, Kilo.
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Dear Colleagues.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We note that Counsel Monthé is there.
Counsel for the Prosecution, you have the floor, but please wait a
minute.  I want to say something to the witness.
Witness, good afternoon.  You are a protected witness giving evidence
for the Prosecution.  Your pseudonym will be CBT, so you will be known
as Witness CBT.  Before answering the Prosecution's questions and
subsequently questions of the Defence, we request you to kindly make a
solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by Witness CBT in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.
Counsel for the Prosecution, you have the floor.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.  If I can just inquire with the registry if
the monitor of the witness stand is displayed.  Is the monitor
displayed at the witness stand?  Thank you, I understand it is.
WITNESS CBT,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   Witness CBT, if you look at the display before you, can you tell me
what appears in that photograph?
A.   I see what appears on this screen.
Q.   What is it?
A.   I observe that what we have on the screen is Nyange church.
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the record, Your Honours, the photograph exhibit being displayed
is Prosecutor's Exhibit 3-21.  I'd ask that the display at the witness
stand be turned off at this time.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   Witness CBT, in April 1994, did you ever go to Nyange church?
A.   I went there.
Q.   On what date in April '94 did you go to Nyange?
A.   I went to Nyange church on the 15th of April.
Q.   Do you recall --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Prosecutor, you gave us a document, but you did not ask us to
admit it.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Thank you, Your Honour.  I'll jump back.
Can the blue ink original be put before the witness of that document,
please.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Objection, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Monthé.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the document that the Prosecutor is exhibiting was
presented here by the Prosecution investigator Sahiri, and it was
said, unless I am mistaken, that we're waiting for a document before
we admit it definitively.  I believe that document has not been
provided; consequently, this document should not be admitted.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.
MR. TOWNSEND:
If counsel is referring to the photograph, I would so move it into
evidence at this time as the same number.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel for the Defence actually said they were waiting for the
invitation card.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For now we are dealing with the personal particulars of the witness.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Is there an objection to that document from the Defence?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Prosecutor, I thought I was expressing myself in French when you were
doing translations.  I expressed the reservations which seem to have
been noted by the Chamber at the beginning of this trial, and that is
all I can say.  I thank you.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I understood counsel's objection to the photograph.  I'm going to
return to the document known as the personal identification sheet and
ask the witness if he has signed the bottom of that page and dated it
October 2004, attesting to the truthfulness and accuracy of the
personal information that appears on that same page.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I appended my signature to this document, as a matter of fact.
MR. TOWNSEND:
A copy of this document was given to the Defence today.  I'd ask that
this document, the personal identifying sheet for this witness, CBT,
be admitted into evidence as the following Prosecutor's exhibit and be
placed under seal to protect his identity.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection from the Defence with regard to admission of these
documents?
MR. MONTHÉ:
No objection, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.
Mr. Registrar, could you give us the number for this document, that
is, the last Prosecution document -- that is the last exhibit of the
Prosecution.
MR. MJUI:
P. 13.  P one three.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Document containing the personal particulars of the witness is
admitted as Prosecution Exhibit
No. P. 13, and this document is placed under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 13 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you very much, Your Honours.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   Witness CBT, do you recall which day of the week 15th April 1994 was?
A.   I recall the day corresponding to that date.
Q.   Which day was it?
A.   It was a Friday.
Q.   At what time of day did you arrive to Nyange on Friday, 15 April
?
A.   I arrived between 11::00.
Q.   Were you carrying anything in your hands at that time?
A.   Yes.
Q.   What?
A.   I was carrying a stick which I use normally for herding cows.
Q.   What was your purpose for going to Nyange?
A.   The authorities had asked us to go and fight the Inyenzi who had
attacked the place.
Q.   What did you understand the term "Inyenzi" to mean at that time?
A.   It meant Tutsis.
Q.   By what means of transport did you go to Nyange on that day?
A.   We went on board a vehicle which had been brought by Police Inspector
Kayishema, and at that time he asked me to come -- to aid and come to
Nyange.
Q.   Do you know to whom that vehicle belonged?
A.   Yes.
Q.   To whom?
A.   This vehicle belonged to Rwamasirabo, Aloys.
MR. TOWNSEND:
If I can give the spelling, Your Honours.  I have that as R-W-A-M-A-S-
I-R-A-B-O, first name
A-L-O-Y-S, Aloys.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   Witness CBT, what did you see when you first arrived at Nyange?
A.   I saw dead bodies in the courtyard of Nyange church.
Q.   Can you estimate how many dead bodies you saw?
A.   I didn't count them, but if I were to make an estimate, I would say
that they reached 500 -- 600, rather.
Q.   To which ethnic group did these dead bodies belong?
A.   These bodies belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group.
Q.   Whom did you understand had killed these Tutsi?
A.   It was the authorities at the time who had asked the people to kill
them and also the Interahamwe.
Q.   Can you estimate the number of attackers you saw on the 15th of April
?
A.   The assailants had surrounded the church.  There were 600, but the
number increased as time went on.
Q.   To which ethnic group did these assailants belong?
A.   The assailants belonged to the Hutu and Twa ethnic groups.
Q.   Who was being surrounded?
A.   It was the Tutsis.
Q.   Where were these Tutsis that were surrounded?
A.   In the Nyange parish church.
Q.   For what reason were they there gathered?
A.   They were refugees because they were being attacked.
Q.   Can you estimate the number of Tutsi seeking refuge in or around the
Nyange parish on 15 April 1994?
A.   An estimate -- first I should point out that there was much shouting,
and our church was full.  If I were to give an estimate, I'd say the
refugees were 2,000 in number.
Q.   In April 1994, who served as Nyange parish priest?
A.   It was Father Athanase Seromba.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to take a 15-minute break.  Court is adjourned.
(Court recessed at 1609H)
(Pages 42 to 49 by Sherri Knox)
(Court resumed at 1628H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is now in session.
Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   Witness CBT, yes or no, did you see Seromba on Friday, 15th April
?
A.   I saw him.
Q.   Can you estimate at what time of day you saw Seromba on 15th April?
A.   I saw him at about twelve o'clock.
Q.   Where did you see Seromba?
A.   I saw him in Nyange church.
Q.   Can you be a little more precise as to the location where you first
saw Father Seromba?
A.   I saw him get out of the secretariat coming from the rear courtyard
of the priests'.
Q.   I've heard something in Kinyarwanda which I'm not sure made it to the
English.  If I can just repose the question for the purposes of
translation.  Where precisely at the secretariat did you mention?
A.   The secretariat is in front of the Nyange parish courtyard.  It is
the office of Mr. Mèdard, who used to work there, and he still works
there now.
Q.   What did you see Seromba do at that time?
A.   He came out from the courtyard, taking with him a teacher called
Anicet Gatare.  He was coming from the rear courtyard.
Q.   Would you say that Gatare went voluntarily?
A.   He went to the backyard because he was threatened, like all other
Tutsis.  By the time he was coming out he was with Father Seromba, who
took him right to the door of the office where various items were
sold, and when they got there he handed him over to the three
gendarmes who were there and who jostled him.  Those gendarmes took
him not far from there and killed him.
Q.   By what means did they kill Gatare?
A.   They killed him with a gun.
Q.   How many of the three gendarmes shot a gun?
A.   Amongst the three gendarmes only one of them shot at him.
Q.   Where on his person was Gatare shot?
A.   He was shot at the ribs, as I am showing you.  (Indicating)
Q.   Can you please stand up and show the same spot?
A.   He was shot on the side, at the ribs, and he fell down dead.
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the record, Your Honour, the witness is standing up, raising his
right arm and showing with his left hand the right ribs area.  If the
record may so reflect.
Do I understand the record may so reflect that, Your Honours?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is what we realise, and that has been noted down.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   How could you determine that these three were actually gendarmes?
And, Witness, you may sit down.
A.   I knew those three persons who were gendarmes because they were
wearing berets, red berets, and they were wearing fatigues.  They were
also carrying guns and the officials of the area referred to them as
gendarmes.
Q.   Where was Seromba when Gatare was shot?
A.   He was at the verandah of that house where certain supplies were
provided or bought.
Q.   Is there a name for the building to which you are now referring?
A.   The population of the civilians refer to it as Mèdard's office and he
used to sell certain items there, but it was also called the
secretariat.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honours, at this time I would ask that photograph, Exhibit 3-01,
be displayed on the projector screen, the curtains be drawn so that
the witness may approach the projector.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, if you can produce the document, the material, and may the
curtains be drawn so that the picture can be shown using the overhead
projector.
Mr. Witness, you may move close to the projector.
MR. TOWNSEND:
For record, Your Honours, this exhibit, Prosecutor's 3-01, is also
identified as K027-1655.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   Witness CBT, do you see the photograph before you on the display?
A.   Yes.
Q.   Can you tell us what you see in that photograph?
A.   I can see a building and that building is that same building of the
parish that we were talking about.
Q.   Is it possible for you to locate on that photograph the place to
which you referred as the location of Seromba at the time that Gatare
was surrendered and shot?
A.   Yes.
Q.   Please so point.
A.   He came out of that door and moved towards where I am pointing, on
the verandah.
Q.   And, for clarity, what did he do at the spot at which you are now
pointing?
A.   He handed over the teacher Gatare to the gendarmes who were there in
that courtyard in front of the building, and the gendarmes took him
away -- a few metres away and shot at him.
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the record, Your Honour, I would offer that the witness has
pointed to the open door that appears on the left-hand side of that
photograph, Exhibit 3-01, and showed a location, holding his pen,
between the second and third columns, as one counts from left to right
on that same photograph at the level of the steps.  May the record so
reflect.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Objection, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Monthé.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Except I am mistaken; I didn't quite hear the witness say exactly what
that building was, except I am mistaken.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, he said it was a building that he had described previously.
Mr. Witness, can you tell us what building that is?
THE WITNESS:
That building served as a library and there was a certain Mèdard who
worked there, and it was known as the secretariat, but the members of
the population -- or the civilian population know it better as
Mèdard's secretariat, and that is where there were certain items that
were sold -- or articles that were sold.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, he pointed to the place, but he didn't put a cross
there.  Do you absolutely want that it was between the first and the
second doors?
MR. TOWNSEND:
Well, let me ask him to point again and we can identify it again, if I
may ask.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   Witness, can you again point and hold your pen at the location that
you said Seromba was at, at that time?
A.   He came out of the store and moved to this spot on the verandah.
Q.   I see steps there.  Where was Seromba standing in relation to the
steps?
I'm going to repeat my question.  I'm not sure if it made it.  Can
you, in words, tell us where Seromba was standing in relationship to
the steps that are seen in that photograph?
A.   He came out of this door that leads to the rear courtyard and moved
to this point that I am pointing to and stood at the over -- the steps
-- over the steps that I am pointing to with the pen.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I would offer, for the record, that the witness is pointing at that
exhibit at the base of the door that is closed, that appears between
the second and third vertical column, if the record can so reflect.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, it's been done.  It's been mentioned in the transcripts -- in the
records.
MR. TOWNSEND:
If the witness can please move to the stand, the photograph removed
and the curtains drawn, I will return to the witness in the booth.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   Witness CBT, can you estimate the distance that separated you from
Seromba at the time of that event?
A.   I cannot remember the distance, but it must have been between six and
seven metres.
Q.   Can you estimate the distance that separated Seromba from Gatare at
the moment he was shot?
A.   About 15 metres separated them.
Q.   Was there a reaction by the assailants to the killing of Gatare?
A.   At that point the assailants were spurred on to attack the church.
Because I heard somebody said -- after Gatare had died I heard a voice
say the king of the Tutsi had died, and that is how they started
shooting at the church.
Q.   After the shooting of Gatare, did you see anybody else shoot a gun?
A.   Yes, other people were killed using gunshots -- or killed with guns,
and other persons died by being stabbed with sharp objects.
Q.   Who did you see shoot first after the killing of Gatare?
A.   There was certain Rukara, a certain Théophile who was nicknamed
Rukara -- or Rukara shot a gun, and the policemen called Niyitegeka
also fired.  Another person called Grégoire fired a gun and others
followed.  There was also a reservist called Gabarisa de Nyange who
fired.  There was a policeman called Rangira, Aloys, who shot the gun.
Aloys Nibarere is another person.  Another person called Faustin
sprayed petrol while the other person was pumping.  There's another
person who made a ladder that people used to climb to the roof of the
church, and then another person threw a grenade.
Q.   You mentioned a Grégoire who shot.  Do you know the last name of that
person?
A.   He was called Ndahimana and was the former bourgmestre of the Kivumu
commune.
Q.   Do I understand that you, yourself, saw Ndahimana shoot?
A.   Yes, I saw him shoot.  After the death of Gatare, other persons were
also encouraged to continue to shoot on the Nyange church.
Q.   Where did Ndahimana's shot impact?
A.   The impact was visible on the window.  When you moved up close to the
statue not far from the church door, that's where the bullet was
lodged -- or that's where the impact of the bullet was.
Q.   To be clear, the window was in which building?
A.   It was the building of the Nyange parish.
Q.   Besides Bourgmestre Ndahimana, did you see any other authorities
present at that time?
A.   Yes, there were many other people.
Q.   Can you please cite the names of the authorities you recall as being
present?
A.   The names, there was as deputy bourgmestre, Rushema, Athanase.  There
was Leonard Nibarere, Théoneste Murangwabugabo,
Vedaste Murangwabugabo, as well as the communal inspector; the
veterinarian, Idelphonse Kubwumukiza; as well as other officials of
the various institutions.  There were also soldiers; for instance, a
person like Mathias Ntasimungu (sic) and other members of the
population.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kazungu, Mathias, I beg your pardon.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   You mentioned the inspector of the judicial police.  What was his
name?
A.   His name was Fulgence Kayishema.
Q.   Did you see any businesspersons or traders?
A.   There was Gaspard Kanyarukiga.  That was the most influential
businessman who was present and he was, by the way, the person who was
advising the assailants who were there.
Q.   You've mentioned some, but can you list all of the weapons you saw
employed that day by the assailants?
A.   They were carrying weapons during that attack against the Nyange
church.  They had grenades, guns, petrol, dynamite, machetes, spears,
clubs, sharp sticks or stakes, and many other traditional weapons.
Q.   Where were you at that time?
A.   I was in the courtyard of the Nyange parish.
Q.   Can you describe the way in which the grenades were used in that
attack?
A.   There was a young man who was carrying grenades and who had tied the
grenades around his waist, and he put a ladder that went right up to
the roof and then he threw grenades towards the inside of the church.
And we would hear explosions each time he threw the grenades.
Q.   What is the name of that person?
A.   His name is Théophile, Rukara; he was nicknamed Rukara.
Q.   What was his occupation or job?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, we did not hear the translation there.
THE WITNESS:
The people who knew him said he was a gendarme.
MR. TOWNSEND:
The question, Your Honour, was what was his job.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   Witness CBT, can you describe the way in which the petrol was used
that day at the church?
A.   There was petrol in buckets and the petrol was sprayed using a cow-
tick pump, and then there was one person who was spraying the petrol
all along the church.
Q.   If you know, can you identify by names the individuals who were doing
what you've describe with the petrol?
A.   It is Leonard Nibarere who was pumping the petrol, and he was working
hand in hand with Faustin Uworinaniye.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The names are rather difficult.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Those that I have, I have given to the court reporters.  I don't know
if we could get a spelling from the interpreters, otherwise, on the
first list two names.  The first one he said is Nibarere which I have,
Your Honours, as N-I-B-A-R-E-R-E.  The second name I didn't have.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Faustin.  There was a Faustin Uworinaniye.  That is the last name on
the list, U-W-O-R-I-N-A-N-I-Y-E; Uworinaniye.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I am much obliged.  Thank you.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   Did anything happen to the church door that day?
A.   They tried to spray fuel on the door of the parish but they did not
succeed, so that they brought an axe and they tried to break open the
door using that axe.  They didn't succeed either and that is how they
abandoned, but they continued to force open the door -- or they gave
up and did not continue to force open the door.
Q.   What did you understand was the purpose of trying to break down that
door?
A.   The objective was to kill those they called the Inyenzi, that is, the
Tutsi who were our neighbours and who had taken refuge inside the
church.
Q.   What happened to the dead bodies?
A.   At a certain point, a bulldozer Caterpillar from Astardi came and
gathered all the corpses and moved towards where the statue was
standing, and there was a pit there and that machine threw those
corpses into that pit.
Q.   Where was the pit located?
A.   It was located close to the CARITAS building, not far from the statue
that was erected there.
Q.   How could you tell that the dead were Tutsi?
A.   The victims were Tutsi because we had been told that Tutsi-Inyenzi
had attacked the church, and on that occasion the assailants were
called upon to come to the rescue of the church and they were told
that Inyenzi had attacked the church.
Q.   Did you recognise anyone among the dead?
A.   (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript [page 56, line
] has been extracted and filed under seal.)
Q.   At what time of day did you leave Nyange parish on 15th April 1994?
A.   I left that place at about 5 p.m. because Télesphore Ndungutse and
Fulgence Kayishema had set up a roadblock to prevent assailants from
going home so long as the work that had been assigned to them had not
been completed.  So we had to hide and pass through the forest which
was close to the parish in order to get away.
Q.   In 1994 was there a market day at Nyange?
A.   Yes, the market square was at Mutanuga and the market was held on a
Saturday.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honour, at this time I have, I think, ten questions which I would
seek to ask in closed session because the answers might disclose this
witness's identity, after which I'd come back for identification and
conclude.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections from the Defence to this application?
MR. MONTHÉ:
No objection, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel Monthé.  We are now going into closed session.
We crave the indulgence of the public.  The purpose of this closed
session is in the interest of justice and to protect the identity of
the witness.  (At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the
transcript [pages 57 to 58] was extracted and sealed under separate
cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 50 to 56 by Verna Butler)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session, Counsel for the Prosecution.  You may
proceed with your examination-in-chief.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.   Witness CBT, might you recognise Father Seromba if you were to see
him today?
A.   Since it is a long time since I last saw him, it is possible that I
could recognise him if I saw him, and that I may not be able to see to
recognise him, given the time that has elapsed since I last saw him.
Q.   Witness, how is your eyesight?  Do you wear glasses?  Do you need
glasses?  Do you see okay?
A.   No, it is not a major problem.  Since I have been in custody for
long, you can imagine the conditions of detention.  That is why when
you have to look at somebody you haven't seen for long, you can
imagine conditions, given the circumstances that prevail in detention.
Q.   Witness CBT, I would like you now to stand on your feet and look
around the courtroom -- if you need to leave the stand, ask the Court,
the Judges, if you can do so -- and tell us, if you recognise anyone
you have called Seromba in your testimony.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may stand up, Witness, and look about you.  Yes?
THE WITNESS:
I would request the Chamber's leave in order to move about this
courtroom and find out whether the person concerned is in this
courtroom.
MR. TOWNSEND:
In previous such circumstances we have remained in open session and
merely drawn the curtains for this and asked that the cameras remain
fixed firmly on the Bench.  If that would please the Court, I think
that's what the witness wishes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We could draw the curtains, but I am wondering whether he shouldn't
try before we authorise him to move about.  Perhaps he could say
something, but if he finds that his eyesight is such that he cannot
see far, in that case we could draw the curtains.
Witness, could you, first of all, look around and tell us whether you
are in a position to recognise the person in this courtroom?
THE WITNESS:
From where I am standing, I do not see the person.  It is possible
that I may not recognise the person's face because many years have
gone by.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In that case, could the curtains be drawn, please.
MR. TOWNSEND:
I see the curtains are drawn.  May the witness now walk freely about
the courtroom to see someone he's called Seromba, and, if not, let him
say so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Witness, you are free to move about to see if you can
identify Father Seromba in the courtroom.
THE WITNESS:
In truth, I do not remember his face.
MR. TOWNSEND:
May the record reflect that the witness has not identified the
Accused.  I have nothing further.  The witness may be seated and the
curtains be opened.  Thank you, Your Honours, I believe I am done with
my direct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May the records so reflect that the witness has not been able to
identify the Accused.
We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.
The time now is 5:25 p.m.  We are going to let this witness go and
then we will hear the next witness tomorrow -- no, of course, the
cross-examination of this witness will take place tomorrow.
I would also like to inform you that tomorrow we can sit all day in
this courtroom.  That is all I have in terms of information.
We thank you, Witness.  You are still under oath.  Tomorrow the
Defence will cross-examine you.  We request you not to communicate
with anybody 'til then.  Thanks to all.
The Court stands adjourned.
(Court adjourned at 1725H)
