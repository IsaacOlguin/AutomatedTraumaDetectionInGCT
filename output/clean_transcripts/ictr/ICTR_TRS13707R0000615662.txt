MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  Good morning, Defence
Counsel.  The Prosecutor is ready to proceed with the evidence of
Witness TAW.  Could the courtroom officer please usher the witness
into the Chamber?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness TAW.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
First of all, you shall make your solemn declaration and then the
Prosecutor will put questions to you.  You shall be cross-examined by
the Defence, and the Judges may have a few questions to put to you.
We shall inform you whether we are in closed session or in open
session so that you can know what you can say and not say.  The
registry will now assist you and you shall make your solemn
declaration.
MR. JUMA:
Mr. Witness, could you please stand up, raise your right hand and
repeat the following words after me.
(Declaration made by Witness TAW in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor.
MR. KAREGYESA:
May it please Your Honours.  Before I proceed with the testimony of
this witness, I move for the Chamber to go into closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I am assuming that you have questions that might reveal the identity
of the witness; therefore, in order to ensure the protection of
Witness TAW the Trial Chamber orders that we move into closed session.
