PROCEEDINGS
(Court opens at 0907H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Court is now in session.
Today the Chamber will continue to hear the testimony of the
witness Nut Nov.
And <the greffier,> Ms. Se Kolvuthy, could you please report the
attendance of the Parties and individuals to today's proceedings?
THE GREFFIER:
Mr. President, for today's proceedings, all Parties to this case
are present.
As for Mr. Nuon Chea, he is present in the holding cell
downstairs as he requests to waive his rights to be present in
the courtroom. His waiver has been delivered to the greffier.
The witness who is to continue his testimony today -- that is,
Mr. Nut Nov; and his duty counsel, Mr. Duch Phary; are present in
the courtroom.
We also have a reserve witness today -- that is, 2-TCW-860, who
confirms that to his best ability he has no relationship by blood
or by law to any of the two Accused: Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan,
nor to any of the civil parties admitted in this case. The
witness will take an oath before the <Iron Club Statue at 10
a.m.> this morning. He has his duty counsel -- that is, Mr. Duch
Phary. Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. Before the Chamber hands the floor to the Parties, we
decide on the request by Nuon Chea.
The Chamber has received the waiver from Nuon Chea, dated 16
March 2015, who confirms that due to his health -- that is,
<headache,> backache <> and that he cannot sit for long, and in
order to effectively participate in the future hearings, he
requests to waive his right to participate in and be present at
the 16th March 2015 hearing. He has been informed by his counsel
about the consequence of this waiver, that in no way it can be
construed as a waiver of his rights to be tried fairly or to
challenge evidence presented or admitted to this Court at any
time during his trial.
Having seen the medical report of the accused, Nuon Chea, by the
duty doctor for the Accused at the ECCC, dated 16th March 2015,
who observes that the health condition of Nuon Chea is that he
has chronic back pain and it becomes worse when he sits for long
and he recommends that the Chamber shall grant him his request so
that he can follow the proceedings remotely from a holding cell
downstairs.
Based on the above information and pursuant to Rule 81.5 of the
ECCC Internal Rules, the Chamber grants Nuon Chea's request to
follow the proceedings remotely from a holding cell downstairs
via audio-visual means for today's proceedings as he waives his
direct presence in the courtroom.
The AV Unit is instructed to link the proceedings to the room
downstairs so that Nuon Chea can participate in and follow
today's proceedings remotely.
The Chamber now hands the floor to the Co-Prosecutors and then
the Lead Co-Lawyers for the civil parties. The combined time for
the Prosecution and the Lead Co-Lawyers is for one session --
that is, from now until the short break this morning.
You may now proceed.
QUESTIONING BY MR.DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL RESUMES:
Thank you. Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours, and the
Parties. Good morning, Mr. Witness. I will continue putting
questions to you.
Q. I would like to start by drawing your attention to a
contradiction since on Thursday last week you said between 15.26
and 15.27 in answer to a question whether you are a member of the
Communist Party of Kampuchea, <when you were> Chief of Srae
Ronoung commune. Your answer was, "I was a candidate; I was not a
full-rights member."
In the record of your interview, E319.1.17, in answer to question
26:
"Did you have any ties with the Kampuchea Communist Party?"
You answered: "As Chief of the commune, I was a member of the
Party."  End of quote. [Free translation]
Is it correct to say, Mr. Witness, that you were indeed a member
of the Kampuchea Communist Party when you were Commune Chief?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. First of all, good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours, and
everyone in and around the courtroom. The response that I made is
correct. At that time, I was the <Srae Ronoung> Commune
Committee, but I was a candidate member of the CPK.
Q. You stated in the record of your interview, E3/5521, in answer
to question 68. The question was: "Who appointed you Chief of the
commune of Srae Ronoung?" <You said that>, "Ta Chim, Ta San and
Ta Kit <appointed me." Could> you specify <who among> Ta Chim, Ta
Kit or Ta San was head of district at the time when you were
appointed Chief of the commune of Srae Ronoung?
A. Amongst the three people, Ta Kit was the <district> Chairman,
Ta San was the member of the Tram Kak district committee and I
was appointed by these individuals to be Srae Ronoung Commune
Chief to replace <Ta> Khun.
Q. Did Ta San become chief of district at <any> point <in> time
when you were Commune Chief?
A. At that time Ta San was a member of the committee, <who had
not been a district chief yet>.
Q. You made mention of Ta Khun. You mentioned that name last
Thursday - <you said--> that was at 14.28, you said - [Free
translation]: "When I went to Srae Ronoung, the former commune
chief had already carried out the purge. So while I was there, I
did not arrest anybody, <no one at all>. That was in 1978."
Can you tell us why Ta Khun was withdrawn by Angkar <considering>
he had <successfully carried out the> purge in Srae Ronoung
commune?
A. To my knowledge and from what I heard at the time, Ta San
called me to meet him and said that Ta Khun committed cruelty in
Srae Ronoung commune and that he disobeyed the instructions from
the upper echelon; for that reason, he was transferred to Mongkol
Borei to work at the dry season rice farming and that I was to be
appointed as the <Srae Ronoung> Commune Chief in 1978, though I
cannot recall the exact month <,probably in March>.
Q. <So> you said <under> oath that there was no arrest of the
enemy at Srae Ronoung commune when you were chief; you also said
earlier that the decision to arrest people and to smash them were
taken by the upper echelon; that was at the hearing of the 12th
March 2015 at 14.15. You mentioned the sector <or rather> the
zone that was authorised to decide who was to be arrested and
<then subsequently> smashed. Is it correct to say that, the issue
of <arresting and smashing people was not dealt with exclusively
by> the commune or <by> the chief of commune but rather from the
upper echelon?
A. Yes, that is correct. The commune level did not have the
authority to make that decision. Only the sector or the zone had
the authority to <arrest or to> execute anyone. Thank you.
Q. Did people come from the district, the sector or the zone in
1978 to Srae Ronoung commune to carry out <arrests> or to smash
people?
A. The district, the sector or the zone level themselves did not
come directly to the commune but they sent in their security
personnel to carry out the task.
Q. So what you mean is that you <yourself> did not carry out any
<arrests> but <that> those arrests were carried out by the upper
echelon in the Srae Ronoung commune?
A. In Srae Ronoung commune, through my observation while I was
there, there were no arrests. However, I was instructed to lead
people in rice farming in order to achieve three tonnes of rice
per hectare and we were very busy engaging with the people at the
worksite and there were no arrests, let me reinstate that and
that is the truth.
Q. <Very well> you stated that you heard of Ta An during the
Democratic Kampuchea regime; that was on Thursday last week just
before <15.13>. Did Ta An ever <send any messages to> Srae
Ronoung commune in 1978?
A. I heard Ta An's name as he was <> at the Krang Ta Chan
Security Office. I only heard of his name but <I never met him
and> I never received any message from him and in my capacity as
the Commune Committee, I was not allowed to go near the Krang Ta
Chan Security Office. I only knew and heard that it was a
security office.
Q. At this point, I would like to quote document .2,
this document was shown to you on Thursday and you identified the
cadre who had been interrogated but <whose name could not be
disclosed>. You identified that person as the commune chief in
Tram Kak District. I will quote this document in English, and
<we're looking at> questions 202 <and> 210. I'll start by giving
the context. This commune chief said the following regarding a
letter sent by Ta An from the Krang Ta Chan Security Centre. I am
quoting in English.
<Question 202:> "When you receive such a letter, what
arrangements did you make?"
Answer: "I sent the people to An and An carried out further
actions. After receiving the letters, I had the villagers search
for those whose names were written in these letters. Then if the
villagers found them, I would send them to the District Office. I
did not know how the District treated them."
Answer 210: "It could be said that they sent those people to the
prison straightaway and reported to the District or they might
have sent them to the District because I'm unclear about that."
End of quote.
<So here we> have a commune chief who confirms that he received a
letter from Ta An and <who then> proceeded to arrest <people> and
<send them> to the District or to <Ta An> prison; does this
refresh your memory regarding any messages that the commune may
have received from the security centre in the district of Krang
Ta Chan.
A. I was not aware that other communes received such message or
instruction but, as for me, I did not.
Q. Very well. Regarding the production of rice, at the hearing of
last Thursday at 14.16.32, you said that if a leader in this area
did not <reach> the quota of three tonnes per hectare that person
was <moved elsewhere or> removed from his or her office. You also
said in answer <number> 80 in your record of interview <E3/5521>,
that you succeeded in concealing half of the rice harvest when it
was good and that you hid it in a granary with a view to
distributing it to inhabitants in the case of scarcity of food.
<So, if I am correct in my calculations, how was it that you>
managed to produce six tonnes of rice per hectare in your
commune? That is, three tonnes for the Party, <otherwise you
would have been removed from office,> and three tonnes hidden in
the granary for the people.
A. No, we could not produce six tonnes of rice per hectare, we
could only reach between 2.5 to three and it was my personal
undertaking that we had to keep some rice yield for <> the people
living in the commune because <I understood that some people in
the commune had food shortage. If we reported everything, we
could not resolve the living condition of people> in the commune,
then I would be responsible. <This was my technique with a person
in charge of warehouse.> For that reason, I kept some of those
rice yields for our communal use. Let me give an example <about
the report, every year> we received <>1000 tonnes of rice yield
<in the commune,> then I would report to the upper echelon that
we produced only 700 kilogrammes <> of rice yield and then I
would keep <one part> of rice yield for <people who had food
shortage. This was the technique to hide the rice yield in order
to help people in the commune.>.
Q. So you said that there were no arrests while you were there
and you gave rice to people and the people did not denounce you
<when> you concealed half of the rice harvest. <For, as per>
answer 84 in your record <E3/5521> -- you said that the
inhabitants adored you and loved you very much. You also said in
answer 76 that you gave the inhabitants of your commune a tin of
husk rice per person and per meal as well as meat every 10 days
and in answer number 81, you stated that you made bread, using
cassava flour. You also said that you did that once every 10 days
and you gave it to the inhabitants of your commune; is that
correct?
A. In my commune, we made a bread baking kiln <in 1978. I did not
remember, probably in mid-1978.> And the breads that we made was
from the cassava flour scrambled with egg <and a little sugar>
and that was to resolve the food supply for people, in particular
we provided at least a bread for each worker for the morning
session. <They could have a bread with palm sugar because my
commune was rich in palm sugar> and that's what happened.
Q. Very well, we'll crosscheck all that <against> the archives of
<Tram Kak and> Krang Ta Chan centre, <first and foremost> we'll
find out whether there were inhabitants of Srae Ronoung who were
arrested and sent to Krang Ta Chan in 1978.
MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
I would like to first of all show you a document and have it
placed on the screen with the authorisation of the President and
it's document is E3/4092 < -- E3/4092>. It is a notebook from
Krang Ta Chan summing up confessions of prisoners arrested
between March and July or August 1978.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. <So first of all the> Khmer page is <00271136 to , I
stuck a little blue post-it on it>; English, 00834796 to 97; and
in French, 00721277.
Here we are talking of two prisoners from the Srae Ronoung
commune: The first one is Chim Hok, C-H-I-M H-O-K; age, 44; he
was from Trach village and Touch Lun, T-O-U-C-H L-U-N; age, 46;
from Trapeang Thnal village; he had the rank of chief corporal at
the Krang Spor (phonetic) Barracks in Phnom Penh <before
returning to Srae Ronoung commune at the time of liberation. So
these> two people had returned from Phnom Penh to Srae Ronoung
after the 17th of April 1975. <The report of Krang Ta Chan
interrogations> mentions that the two despicable <persons> tried,
<along> with others, to flee to Vietnam. They were arrested in
Region 35 and sent to District 105. They stated that they could
not live in Democratic Kampuchea because, previously, they
received a salary; that they used to go to the market and they
ate whenever they wanted.
Witness, do you remember <these people>, Chim Hok and Touch Lun
who tried to flee from Srae Ronoung <commune> when you were chief
and <who> found themselves in Krang Ta Chan after they were
arrested?
A. Your Honours, I would like to consult with my duty counsel
before responding to the prosecutor's questions.
(Short Pause)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, please respond to the question.
MR. NUT NOV:
A. I would like to respond to this question. The names indicated
by the Co-Prosecutor, before I went to Srae Ronoung, there were
people fleeing; I heard of that but Chim <Hun (phonetic)> and
Touch Lun, here, I didn't know these two people but I heard that
people were arrested and sent away before my arrival. The
handwriting here is not mine. It may be written by the militiamen
or any other person, I don't know. That's all I can tell you.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. It's a notebook from the Krang Ta Chan Security Centre, so I'm
not surprised that you don't know the handwriting. <Another
document I would like to show you -- no excuse me -- another>
page in this same document, in Khmer, it's <00271141>; in
English, <00834801;> and French, <00721283>. This is still a
Krang Ta Chan report which concerns the prisoner Vath Than, 42
years of age, who was a secretary in a commercial bank in Phnom
Penh and after the 17th of April 1978, he went to live in the
Kiri Vong district and then he was sent by Angkar to the commune
of Srae Ronoung where he was arrested and to quote the report
from Krang Ta Chan: "This guy only has <disdain and> contempt for
us. He says that the bread you get today is absolutely nothing
compared to the bread we used to get. He would rather have
<cassava>; he would boil them and eat them for sheer enjoyment.
That would be better." End of quote. [Free translation]
<I would like to present another> document on the same person,
<this> is document E3/4122 and with the leave of Your Honours, I
would like to put this on the screen as well. The Khmer page is
00271085; French, 00729669; and English, 00779252. So, <this
other> report, also concerns the same prisoner, Vath Tan. It's a
notebook from Krang Ta Chan, dated May or June 1976 <according to
what we can see in the remainder of the content of this> document
and <this report> provides further details about the prisoner
interrogated in the Krang Ta Chan Security Centre -- and I quote.
"This man is hostile to the Revolution. He has devalued our
course saying that a casserole of rice is rationed for four
people. Nobody can eat enough. As for cassava, it's made into
bread, <comparable to a grilled cake, but in English reference is
made to a "burnt cake" so perhaps what is meant is indeed> a
burnt cake. If the cassava was kept to boil it that would be
better." End of quote.
<So> it seems <that> apparently all of the inhabitants of Srae
Ronoung were not absolutely enamoured with either your bread or
the rations of rice they were given. So could you please tell the
Chamber why a person from your commune was arrested and sent to
Krang Ta Chan and interrogated for having criticised the ration
of rice <that they> received and for having said that your bread
tasted of burnt cake?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. The information on this document, as far as I know, the people
in my commune did not make any complaint; <they just ate
regardless of their like or dislike>. But I cannot make any
conclusion<>, but at <another> worksite called Tuol <Kruos Dam>,
I don't know what <> was happening there. <They> reported from
that worksite. Because <there were people> from Srae Ronoung
<going> to work at Tuol <Kruos Dam> worksite but there was no
complaint at my commune. That's all.
Q. So, was this site in the commune of Srae Ronoung or not?
A. Tuol <Kruos> worksite was not in Srae Ronoung <commune>, it
was under the supervision of the District Office. But people were
sent from <all> communes <in the district> to work at Tuol
<Kruos> worksite.
Q. Earlier on, <you made> reference to taste. But here we are
<not> talking <about taste sir, rather we are talking about>
criticising the food, <then> being arrested and interrogated and
who knows, maybe even executed as well. Was it your decision to
arrest this kind of person <for> this sort of criticism or was it
rather a district or sector decision?
A. When I was in charge there, I didn't know about that. It might
be that the decision was made at the District level, because the
work site was <in Tuol Kruos which was> far away from my commune.
Q. <Very well.> I have another Krang Ta Chan document to show
you, it's document E3/4083 and I want to use this for two
purposes. I would also like to put the relevant pages on the
screen, Mr. President, if I may, and I will give you the ERN
straightaway.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your request is granted, Co-Prosecutor.
MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
This is another Krang Ta Chan notebook containing <lists> of
prisoners who were arrested in 1978. It includes at least six
prisoners who were sent from Srae Ronoung commune when you were
the Commune Chief. Firstly, in Khmer, ; English,
00323944, <and> that's ; in French, 00778852; and here you
can find <the name, or not the name but rather the position of> a
former secretary from the Khmer Trading Bank who was imprisoned
on the 19th of March 1978 and eliminated on the 29th of March
1978. Probably this was Vath Tan, who we have been referring to
at an earlier stage because he was secretary in a trading bank.
On the same page in Khmer, there is another entry relating to
Srae Ronoung <who entered> Krang Ta Chan on 29th of <April,
probably in 1978>. In English it is ; and French,
00778853. After that, we have somebody called <Siev -- Sieu, or
Siev (phonetic)>, age 43, from the village of Trapeang Ronoung,
in the commune of Srae Ronoung, in Khmer, the page is 00068027;
in English it's on , ERN 003232952; and French, 00778860.
After <then> we have a teacher and <two> former <corporals> in
Lon Nol's army. The teacher is in Khmer, 00068029; English, page
15, 00323957; and French, 00778863; this teacher was arrested on
the 5th of March 1978.
Now on the same page just underneath the teacher, there is a
former corporal from Srae Ronoung who came in on the 5th of March
and who died of disease on the 19th of March -- or May 1978,
depending on the translation.
And finally, a former corporal who was imprisoned on the 4th of
March 1978, and eliminated on the 29th of March 1978, for him the
page number - in Khmer, it's <still the same page as before I
think:> 00068029,; in French, 00778864; and in English, 00323958.
MR. PRESIDENT:
<You may proceed, Counsel Koppe.>
MR. KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, Your Honours. I object to
the word "eliminated". I think it would be better if the
Prosecution would at least say "allegedly eliminated." He's
basing himself probably on a cross on that page, we don't know
for sure that these are in fact Krang Ta Chan documents, we do
not know for sure that that cross might be indication of
elimination, so I think at this stage he should say "allegedly
eliminated". Not to confuse this witness.
MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Thank you. I won't come back to the colleague's remarks saying
that these are -- maybe not documents from Krang Ta Chan. <In any
case these documents were admitted by your Chamber and certain
witnesses have acknowledged the -- authenticity thereof>. I'm
only using the terms that were translated, <that's> from Khmer
into English where in French it <clearly states "éliminer"
(eliminate(d))>, so I certainly didn't invent the term. <In any
case, in the French version, when I said that they were
"eliminated">, it is because that is how it is translated.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. So, Mr. Witness, if, <essentially,> nobody was arrested in
your commune, <how do you explain the fact that> six people were
sent to the District Security Centre in 1978?
A. All these names might be sent to Krang Ta Chan before my
arrival <that was why I did not know. As I told you previously,>
after my arrival to Srae Ronoung commune, no one was arrested and
sent to the Krang Ta Chan centre.
Q. Yes, you <mentioned that you arrived there> in 1978 -- or
rather, the end of '77 <if I remember correctly>, all of these
people <were arrested or, in any case, placed in> Krang Ta Chan
<as of> March 1978, so that, in fact, is the time when you were
in office there.
Perhaps the last question now: In the various communes where you
worked during the Democratic Kampuchea regime, were the lists of
Vietnamese of people from Kampuchea Krom drawn up and sent in to
the District <during that time>?
A. In other different communes and as it happened in my commune,
we prepared the list but we would keep at the commune office for
just in case. It was just the census of the villagers in our
commune.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Koppe, you may proceed.
MR. KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to revisit my objection as
to document E3/4083. In my English version I don't see that word
- the English word of "éliminer" so I would like very much if the
Prosecution can point to me where in E3/4083 it says
"eliminated". I do see "died of illness" of certain prisoners but
maybe there's a difference in translation between the French and
the English. I would like to have that cleared up.
MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
There are certainly <small> discrepancies between the languages
<but> the term "eliminated" was used in the French version
concerning the former secretary of the Khmer Trading Bank. In
English, it's on  of <this> document. Moreover, on page
<00323958, in English, it's used in reference to a former
corporal. These are the terms used in French>. I do understand
there are discrepancies in the translation between the different
languages.
Mr. President, <I have run> out of time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
<You may proceed, Judge Lavergne.>
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Thank you. We may have a difficulty with the reference of the
document. <This morning I heard the prosecutor> refer to
<document E3/4083, and I hear Counsel Koppe> is referring to
E3/4093, so it may be that we are talking about different
documents. Is it <document E3/4083 or 4093?>
MR. KOPPE:
E3/4083, and I think that's what I said specifically and the
prosecutor reacted in a sense that he says there might be
differences but the word "eliminated" versus - the non-use of
"eliminated" was not a minor discrepancy, but a substantial
difference. So again, E3/4083, in English, the word "eliminated"
does not appear, so I would be very happy to hear where it does
appear in French.
MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
<It does indeed appear in French on  which concerns>
the secretary of the <Khmer Trading Bank, it seems to me that>
the English translation is not a full rendering of the <original>
Khmer version. <Mr President, for the sake> of this question, <I
do not deem this to be a debate worth delving into at this
present time. I merely wanted> to point out to the witness that
these people had been arrested and <that they were at> Krang Ta
Chan. Whether or not they were eliminated, <that is something> we
could come back to at a later stage <when we discuss the
documents>
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. <So now, I would like to --  I'm aware that I'm encroaching>
on my civil party colleague's time but I would like quickly to
refer to another part of <the same document> E3/4083 and there
are two pages in Khmer, <00068033 and then we skip a page to
00068035; there are therefore two pages> and this is meant to be
a continuous list but there is in fact another page <inserted>
between the two: in English, <00323966 up to 68>, and then from
70 to 72; and in French, 00778870 to 71, and then 00778873 to 74.
<So this> is a Srae Ronoung commune list dated 27th of April
1977, which lists 37 families who were Khmer Krom or former
soldiers or officials from the ranks of Lon Nol's personnel and
<this list includes these people's military ranks. You> said that
in your <commune -- I do not know which -- that> a list was drawn
up that had been kept in reserve <just in case.>
<Why> were the communes <of the> districts of Tram <Kak, in any
case that of Srae Ronoung> drawing up lists of Khmer Krom <or of>
former Lon Nol <military forces> in April 1977?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. In 1977, I knew that people were registered and census was
made and people who were Vietnamese and Khmer Krom people were
listed and the lists were kept at different commune's office.
These documents might probably be made during Ta Khun reign of
the commune. So, when I arrived, <it was already done and> I did
not do this kind of list, so I think this list was prepared by Ta
Khun at the time.
Q. And what happened to all of <those> people who were on the
lists in the different communes, whether they were Vietnamese or
Khmer Krom, <do you know> what <happened to them afterwards?
A. After preparing the list, those lists were kept at different
commune office for record. That's all I can tell you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Koppe, do you have anything to address the Court?
MR. KOPPE:
I apologise for being a little bit stubborn. But I do have to
revisit this document because right now I have in front of me the
French page and I have in front of me the English page. The
French page is E3/4083, that's the ERN 00778852, it says indeed,
"19th March, 'éliminer'", and then it says a date, "the 29th of
March 1978". That date doesn't appear in the English version and
the word "éliminer" or "eliminated" also does not appear in the
English translation. Now it might seem to be a detail because
this witness cannot say anything about it but if there is a
substantial difference in translation of potentially crucial
documents, I think, we might have a problem.
(Judges deliberate)
MR. PRESIDENT:
This document was in Khmer, it's quarto provision; on this
document, it means the abbreviation of "komtech", in English
"smash". So, the Co-Prosecutor referred to this document -- it
was not the same as earlier -- <it was written as "komtech"
meaning> "smash" on the 29th March <1978> and it is in <>
quotation and underlined. It means the same "smash on the 29th
March 1978". In Khmer it is the same.
MR. KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. President, for your explanation. I'm not sure if
we have already established that the abbreviation "KT" means in
fact "komtech". But that's -- maybe assumed for a second -- but
it still doesn't explain why that date is not mentioned in the
English version and why apparently the translator wasn't able to
translate that word and the French translator was.
(Judges deliberate)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And in order to save time, the Chamber will instruct the ITU to
clarify the translations and then we will inform the Parties in
due course and the <International> Deputy Co-Prosecutor, you may
continue.
MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
I merely <wished to state> that I have no further questions, Mr.
President <as my time has run out.> I would like to <leave some>
time <for> my colleague from the civil parties. Thank you <Mr.
President>
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. And the designated lawyer for civil parties, you may
proceed.
Lawyer for civil parties, there is no need for formalities you
just go straight to your question as your time is very short<,
just 10 minutes>. Please switch on your microphone.
QUESTIONING BY MR. LOR CHUNTHY:
Thank you, Mr. President. My name is Lor Chunthy, a civil party
lawyer; and good morning, Mr. Witness. The Deputy Co-Prosecutor
has asked you certain questions and I have some more questions to
put to you as well.
Q. When evacuees arrived at your base, how many times were their
biographies taken?
A. When those evacuees arrived at our base, I did not have the
authority to make a list as I said I was involved with the
economic section at Nhaeng Nhang and the list was actually made
or drawn by the district <committee> and I did not know how many
times the biographies were made. I was mainly dealing with the
<food> supply to the front battlefield.
Q. At that time were there any meetings <amongst commune
committee> on the making of biographies of those people?
A. Yes. There were meetings held for each village head with the
commune chiefs but I did not involve in making the list of those
biographies.
Q. You stated before this Court, there were purges inside and
outside the rank. My question to you is about the implementation
of that plan at the commune or <village> level. Was there any
<meeting on> such plan for the commune to implement that
instruction?
A. As for the plan to purge the enemy inside and outside the
Party rank, in fact there was an announcement or instruction from
the sector to the district and to the lower levels about this
instruction, <inside the Party rank, there were cadres and>
whoever that committed a wrong doing or opposed the Party,
including the cadres, would be considered the enemy<. There were
disappearances successively. They were taken to other places,> so
those cadres <who opposed the cooperative> were considered the
enemies <outside> the Party ranks. <Not only> the <full-right>
people <and reserve people but also everyone> who opposed the
Party <> were considered the enemies<>.
Q. Also on this point, who actually drafted the report on the
issue of the enemies inside and outside the Party rank?
A. It was the commune who produced the report and submitted to
the relevant upper district <and to sector>. Sometimes the report
was written by the commune chief or by a clerk at the commune
office.
Q. Also in relation to this point -- and as you just stated,
there was a commune secretary and there was a commune office
clerk. What was the authority of the commune chief or the commune
clerk in producing that report?
A. The commune secretary or the commune clerk could only produce
a report based on the report from the village level. They did not
have any authority to make a decision but they only made a report
based on the reports from the village level and then they
forwarded such a report to the district.
Q. When you were a Commune Committee; for example, for Nhaeng
Nhang commune, Srae Rononug commune, Angk Ta Saom commune, were
you assisted by a commune office clerk?
A. In fact for each commune, there <were> supposed to be clerks
to assist in the works of the commune because sometimes the
commune chiefs went down to the worksite and they were busy
there. As in my case, starting from 1977, I spent most of my time
at the worksite <in Kampong Youl, Angk Roka, Tuol Sangkae>. So,
at the commune office, somebody would act in my capacity. Within
a year I engaged in the worksites, I engaged in digging canals
and <> dry season farming <in Kampong Youl worksite>, and I
worked full year of 1977, and at that time my function was a
member of the Commune Committee.
Q. You talked about worksites and it means that there were mobile
units working there. The mobile units who were sent to worksites,
were they classified into different categories, for instance, as
in the three categories of the people who were classified at the
time?
A. As for the force working at the worksites, they were not
distinguished in different categories as they all joined hands
working together -- that is, all the forces <including commune
committee and people.> And that applies to both building a dam,
or digging a canal or working at <> dry season rice farming.
However, they would be divided into different work units <such as
water unit, seedling transplanting unit, and ploughing unit>.
Q. As for the young children, what were they assigned to do in
your commune?
A. As for the children at the time, they were assigned to gather
cow dung and store it in one place and for the afternoon session,
they would be assigned to attend a class to study the alphabets
for one or two hours. And when they were free, they would be
ordered again to collect cow dung or to cut "kantreang khet" tree
leaves <in order to make natural fertilizer>.
Q. The children who were allowed to study at the time, did they
attend proper schooling, <was there any proper> classroom
building? <Were teachers educated?>
A. In fact, there was no proper building structure. The children
studied either under a house or under a big tree and the teachers
were not properly trained as they only knew how to read or write
<Khmer> or there were some teachers who were former teachers from
the former regime <or there were children who could read and
write> and who could teach <other> children.
Q. In the various communes that you supervised or managed, <how
was the healthcare sector there?> What would happen when people
got ill? <Where would they go?> Was there like a proper hospital
for treatment?
A. In each commune and in particular in my commune, there were
five to six medics for the treatment of the villagers and if they
could not be treated, they would be sent to a <sector> hospital
at Angk <Roneab pagoda> for further treatment. As for the
medication, it was in small supply.
Q. As for the medicine, was it modern medicine or was it
traditional herbal medicine?
A. There was very minimal amount of <traditional> medicines.
<>There was <Penicillin, Stripto (phonetic) and some others which
was collected from district hospital. Mainly, there was medicine
which was boiled and put into> half a litre bottle. <I don't
understand what salty serum or sweet serum was. I had no skill in
medical term, but I saw it.>
Q. As for the sick people and due to the <poor healthcare>, for
instance, did some of them die?
A. Yes, they did. It happened successively. When I was in charge
of Srae Ronoung, <there was enough food and> not many people died
from illness. <However, before I was in charge>, they were sent
to Angk <Roneab> hospital for treatment and some of them
<successively> died there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is now convenient for a short break. We will take a break now
and return at 10.30. <Please be back in the courtroom.>
Court officer, could you assist the witness <at the waiting room
for witnesses and civil parties> during this short break and
invite him and the duty counsel back into the courtroom at 10.30.
The Court is now in recess.
(Court recesses from 1016H to 1033H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Trial Chamber is now back in session and I
would like to hear from Judges: Do you have any questions to put
to this witness? If so, you may proceed.
Judge Lavergne, you may proceed.
QUESTIONING BY JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Yes, I have very few questions <but I would like something
cleared up>.
Q. Mr. Witness, you made mention of Ta San, who was a cadre at
the district <level>. Was Ta San known by another name? Was he
also called Ta Ouch --"Ta Ouch">?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. During the regime, I didn't know his name by Ta Ouch, but I
knew him very well at the time by Ta San. But I don't know where
he is now <because we are separated>. But didn't hear his name
called <Ta> Ouch during the regime.
Q. Were there other cadres in Tram Kak district who also bore the
name Ta San?
A. No. There was no other person by the name of Ta San; only one
Ta San was the district chief <of Tram Kak district>.
Q. And yet, Mr. Witness, when I read your statement, E3/5521, at
answer 67, you make mention of a person called Ta San who was a
member of Srae Ronoung commune. Does that remind you of anything?
A. I didn't say Ta San was the <member of> Srae Ronoung Commune
Committee but he was the member <> of Tram Kak district. <When he
arrived, he was in Tram Kak district.>
Q. I'll read answer 67. This question was put to you.
"What was the name of your <deputy chief> at Srae Ronoung?"
Answer: "<The person called> Som Phoa, <now> deceased, was the
deputy and the old <San,> Ta San was <simply a> member." <So who
was the member of the Srae Ronoung commune?>
<MR. KOPPE:>
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you are clear; <it was Ta Sorn, not> Ta San, but could you
wait until we hear from the witness in his response to the
Judge's question. <There may be some confusion. It was Sorn in
Khmer.> But we would like to hear from the witness first. <Who
was Sorn in Srae Ronoung commune?>
At Srae Ronoung commune, who was Ta San?
Witness, now you can proceed.
MR. NUT NOV:
A. <Sorn> was the member of Srae Ronoung, but he is now dead. Som
Phoa was the deputy chief of the commune of Srae Ronoung. They
both died. He was not Ta San, but his name was Ta Sorn.
BY JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Q. Thank you for that clarification. <I have a> few questions
about the cadres working <at> the district level. Have you heard
<people speak of a man who went by the name of> Iep Duch, <who
was> responsible for youth at the district level?
A. Iep Duch, I know him very well. He was the chief of Tram Kak
Youth Committee before, and later he was sent to Krang Ta Chan.
He worked there, and later he was sent to the North Zone, but I
don't know which rank he was holding. But now he has died three
or four years ago, when he drank too much and then he was
fatigued and died.
Q. Have you heard of <someone who went by the name of> Phann
Chhen?
A. Phann Chhen was a former cadre who worked there, but I don't
know where he is living now. But he used to be at Kus commune.
Q. <Did> Phann Chhen work at Krang Ta Chan?
A. I didn't hear that he was working at Krang Ta Chan.
Q. Have you heard <of a cadre -- or> the name of a cadre called
<Phy-- Phy> and who was disabled, in the legs?
A. I knew Phy who was handicapped on his legs. Earlier he was at
Tram Kak district and later he was sent to be commune chief in
<107> either Roka commune or <Roneam> commune; I <do> not
remember well that name.
Q. Mr. Witness, here's my last question. Did you ever make
district level requests for <food> provisions to be sent to your
commune when <you were lacking such food provisions>? Did you
ever make requests of that kind?
A. When there was food shortage or clothing for the people, I
used to make a request and it was sent to the District Office.
Q. And generally speaking, did you receive clothing or food when
you made the request for them?
A. When I sent a request to the District Office but the district
would supply with cloth, not dress or clothing. We receive <cloth
successively> but not sufficient as we were in need at the time
<in the commune>.
Q. What about food <provisions>? Did you <receive food
provisions> from the district?
A. Yes. In terms of food, we received some quantity of rice. It
used to be supplied from time to time to the commune.
Q <So why is it then that you> hid some of the harvest if you
<received rice every time that you put a request through to the>
district?
A. The reason I hid some food just to be ready to supply in case
we don't have enough food for the people. And sometimes I also
requested for food from the District Office so that I can have
sufficient for my people <and they could have energy to work>.
This is one of my techniques in supervision and management of
people in my commune.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Thank you, Mr. Witness. I have no further questions.
MR PRESIDENT:
Next, the Trial Chamber would like to give the floor to the
defence counsels. And first, the defence counsel for Nuon Chea
will take the floor first to put questions to this witness.
Counsel, now you may proceed.
QUESTIONING BY MR. KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, Mr. Witness. I would like
to ask you a few questions, and I would like to start with
reading back to you an answer that you gave to the Investigators
-- that is, D118/34, question and answer 20. The question reads
as follows:
"What year did the purging take place?"
And your answer at 20 is -- and I quote: "At that time, the first
secretary of Sector 13 was Ta Saom. He had been called to study
at Phum Phnum Klaeng and disappeared with two to three commune
chiefs. I thought those persons had been purged but I did not
know where they were taken to. They only said that those persons
were called to study. I do not recall what year it was."
And in the other document, E3/5521, in answer 119 -- A119 -- the
question is: "Do you remember who the sector committee was?"
Your answer: "Saom (it is not known if he is still alive) was,
later on Ta Brak (he was arrested in '77 or '78), then Ta Ran (It
is not known if he's still alive), then Ta Tith (he was born in
Trapeang Thum village, Tram Kak district), and then Ta Kit
(deceased), was the sector committee."
Q. Mr. Witness, my question is first about this person Ta Saom.
In your first answer that I read to you, you said that he was
called to study at Phnum Klaeng. Can you tell us how you know
this fact?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. When he was called to a study session, the letter was from a
District Office that he will go to Phnum Klaeng. It was the
school for the sector office. It was under the supervision of Ta
Saom.
Q. And where is Phnum Klaeng?
A. Phnum Klaeng was to the south of Takeo provincial town in
Treang district. It was probably 3 kilometres away from the
provincial town of Takeo.
Q. And how do you know that he got a letter from the District to
come to study?
A. During that regime, the letter was delivered by the messengers
at the commune level.
Q. And in your answer you are saying that he disappeared along
with two to three commune chiefs. Do you remember who these two
to three commune chiefs were?
A. After the meeting, there was a live view discussion at the
school and his disappearance at the time in Angkor Chey district,
also in Takeo province -- it was codenamed as 106 district -- and
a person whose name is unknown to me, people <> disappeared from
Samlanh commune and from Angkor Chey and <Mroum> commune, those
were the commune chiefs who disappeared.
Q. Would you be able to tell us the reason why you think he
disappeared?
A. The disappearance -- I noticed that in the next meeting they
did not appear at the meeting and I heard that they were arrested
and sent for study session. They were the commune chiefs that I
mentioned earlier -- from the communes I mentioned earlier.
Q. Do you know the reason for the arrest of Ta Saom?
A. I didn't know about it because he was from the sector level. I
didn't hear about that during the regime; I have just heard here
in this Court, in this hearing <today about the arrest of Ta
Saom>.
Q. What is it exactly, Mr. Witness, that you have heard in this
Court?
A. I heard that Ta Saom was arrested. I have never heard this
before.
Q. Maybe I'm misunderstanding your answer, but I thought that was
the thing that you had said yourself in the statement and are
repeating now. So maybe there is some confusion about the
translation, but was Ta Saom arrested? And if yes, for what
reasons, if you know?
A. No, I don't know that he was arrested. But I noticed that he
disappeared from Sector 13. I heard during that time he was sick
and he went away for treatment. After his disappearance, Ta Prak
was assigned to replace him and for this person -- later Ta Prak
was also arrested, disappeared, and then Ta Rorn was sent to
replace him, and then Ta Rorn was sent to the <assembly> in Phnom
Penh and he <>injured his leg by a train accident and Ta Rorn
disappeared, and finally Ta Tith was assigned to replace him and
later for a while, Ta Tith went away <unknown>. So it was secret
to the commune people. And after Ta Kit was assigned to replace
him. And Ta Kit was there for about a few months, and then the
country was liberated <>by the Vietnamese troops.
Q. Mr. Witness, do you remember when Ta Rorn replaced Ta Prak?
A. I do not recall the specific year but I just knew that he was
replaced.
Q. In your answer you said that Ta Prak was arrested in '77 or
'78. Do I understand you correctly that Ta Rorn must have been
arrested after Ta Prak? So, maybe, somewhere '78 or maybe '77?
A. I don't recall the specific date but I knew that he was
arrested.
Q. Do you know if there is any connection between Ta Saom and
Chou Chet?
A. I don't know any connection of people who were at the upper
echelon. I didn't know and nor did I hear about that.
Q. Do you know who the Secretary of the West Zone was?
A. No, I don't know him. And I do not know his name either.
Q. Does Ta Sy ring a bell?
A. I heard from people of his name, Ta Sy, but I have never met
him in person, I just heard his name.
Q. Have you ever heard whether there was a relation between Sy
and Saom?
A. No, I don't know about that.
Q. What can you tell us about a person called Ta Keav? What do
you remember of him?
A. I know Ta Keav very well. I know his background. He was from
the same <commune> as mine. I knew him very well.
Q. Do you know what happened to him in DK?
A. He was the Secretary of Tram Kak in 1970. After the
liberation, he was removed and sent to the sector mobile unit at
Angkor Borei. It was somewhere at Angkor Borei mountain -- might
be to the south of that mountain -- and later I heard that he was
arrested and sent to <Sanlong> Mountain for detention. But I
don't know the reason behind his arrest, and finally he was sent
to Vihear Khpos, and finally he was sent to an area to the south
of Phnom Penh. I don't remember the name of that mountain, and
then he disappeared after the liberation of Cambodia by the
Vietnamese troops.
Q. Do you know if Ta Keav had any relationship with Sy -- or Chou
Chet? That's the same person.
A. No, I didn't know about that.
Q. Mr. Witness, we have been talking about some fellow cadres
that you knew, and a few of them you said were arrested. Do you
have any knowledge as to why they were arrested? Why they were
taken out of the district, or out of the sector?
A. During the regime, everything was secret. I didn't know about
that.
Q. I understand, but you might have heard details or you might
have acquired knowledge after 1979. Is that the case?
A. As for information after 1979, I heard about the cadres who
had been arrested and subsequently smashed by Pol Pot -- means
they had all been killed - because, later on, none of them was
ever seen, including Ta Keav.
Q. Would you be more precise, Mr. Witness, as to the fate of
Saom, Keav and Ta Prak? What was the reason that you think they
were smashed?
A. I didn't know for sure. I only knew that after his arrest, he
disappeared. Ta Keav, who lived in the same <commune>, was taken
together with his wife and two of his younger children, but I did
not ask him, nor did I see it, but I heard that he was killed.
Q. Have you heard any information after 1979 indicating that
Saom, Keav and Prak were in the network of Sy or Chou Chet?
A. I didn't know about that even after 1979. I was arrested by
the Vietnamese troops and placed at the refashion centre at Kaoh
Andaet <for six years>. It was known as the relocation centre or
Office 163 and <first> it was controlled by the Vietnamese
troops, but <later> there were some Cambodians who worked there
and who knew me. Then I was asked to fill in the forms <to meet
my wife and children> in 1986 <but I do not know the exact day
when I was released from the detaining center or office 163>. And
when I returned to my village, I was appointed as deputy village
chief and subsequently due to my work experience during the
regime -- although there were both positive and negative aspects
of it -- of course the good thing <which was> the positive side
was about 60 to 70 per cent, and then <district committee
appointed me to be a deputy chief> of Angk <Roneab village> and
subsequently <>I stood for a member of the commune <committee>
and subsequently I was elected as a member of Tram Kak District
Committee.
Q. But is it your testimony that after '79 you were re-educated,
or refashioned, for six years by the Vietnamese?
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. Mr. Witness, you briefly mentioned a person with the name Phy
and that this person had an accident. You gave some details
earlier, but I would like to ask you to be a little more
specific. What do you remember about Phy?
A. I did not know what happened to Phy since he worked in a
different commune or district.
Q. Have you ever heard stories that Phy was executed in 1979 by
the Vietnamese?
A. No, I was not aware of that.
Q. Do you know what role, if any, Phy had in relation to Krang Ta
Chan or Re-education Office 105?
A. No, I did not. I only knew that he was a Commune Committee of
District 107 and he was in Roneam commune. <I am not quite sure.>
Q. Mr. Witness, there are other witnesses who have testified that
Phy was in fact -- was possibly the superior of Ta An, who was
managing Krang Ta Chan. Does that ring a bell?
A. No. I was not aware of that and I only heard that Ta An was
chief of Krang Ta Chan Security Centre.
Q. Can you tell us some more about what accident Phy had?
A. I did not know the details regarding Phy's accident.
Q. Do you know if he was hit by a car or by a train? Does that
refresh your memory?
A. No, I cannot recall that.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. I would like to move on to another
subject, that's the subject about the food situation. I would
like to refer you to your answer in E3/5521. Your answer, A48.
The question of the investigators is: "Where was rice taken
from?" And then you answer: "I did not know, but knew that there
was overseas aid." Can you give us some more details as to this
overseas aid? Where did it come from? How much was it? Details
like this.
A. After the liberation of the country in 1975, I knew about rice
aid as the communes were called to collect them from the
district, although I did not know from which overseas countries
donated the rice to Cambodian people <because I did not ask them.
I just knew it was foreign aid> after the conclusion of the war
<with Lon Nol's regime>.
Q. Did you hear maybe afterwards where the overseas aid came
from? Maybe from China? Or you don't know.
A. It was likely that the aid came from China, or it could be
from another country because I am not sure.
Q. Do you have any memories as to the amount of this overseas aid
coming into your commune? Was it small? Was it big? Are you able
to say anything about this overseas aid?
A. The aid was not enough although it kept coming in at the time.
For each time we received about 10 sacks of rice for distribution
to the villagers <in the commune>. But I cannot give you the
exact figure of the amount of aid we received.
Q. Do you remember how soon, or how quick after liberation you
saw the first sacks of overseas aid coming into your commune?
A. No, I cannot recall the period. I only recall that the
economic section went to pick the rice from the district and then
brought it into the commune.
Q. Do you remember how long the overseas aid in the form of rice
was coming into your commune? How long did that last? Did it go
into '76 or did it go into '77?
A. The aid continued until 1976, and after that, each commune
started to produce the amount of rice yield <from time to time>.
Q. Do you remember whether it was only rice coming in or was it
also other food products that were coming in after the liberation
in the form of overseas aid?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please wait for the microphone to be operational
first.
MR. NUT NOV:
A. There seems to be nothing else but rice, however, there could
be clothing and that we used it for the supplies to our people.
And there <was little medicine provided from time to time>, but I
cannot recall the details or the <exact> amount we received.
However, for this aid, they did not come in frequently. <It was
once in a while.>
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. Are you able to tell from your memory whether, at one point in
time after liberation, the food situation got better, that there
was more rice available for the people? For instance, would you
be able to make a comparison in terms of rice production and food
supply between 1975 and 1976 in your commune?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. On the situation of the living condition in my commune, the
food supply was not sufficient as the rice yield was not that
plenty. Other communes at the upper level in the area produced
sufficient product. Then a request was made to the district and
then some surplus from other communes was given to us to resolve
the living condition of our villagers. At that time gruel was
given to people in the morning and for the afternoon they had
cooked rice. And let me state that, at the time, the food was not
sufficient.
Q. Was there, in your memory, a point in time in the years
between '75 and '79 that the food situation did become
sufficient? In other words, are you able -- or is it the
situation that, at one point, there was no lack of food anymore?
A. It was very difficult <in terms of food.> People <did not
have> sufficient food to eat. In fact it was not that sufficient
but there was more produce, more rice and more vegetables, and we
also raised livestock, including pigs and chickens, and the
economic section also sent people to go fishing in order to
gather supplementary food for our people. Every 10 days in my
commune and in other communes as well, people were given pork or
beef. It means they would receive the meat, <not vegetables> for
that whole day. Sometimes a commune would kill a <pig, so people
would have pork to eat on that day>. And that also happened in my
commune. So we did raise livestock to supplement our food
although it was not plentiful. But we could resolve the food
shortage from time to time.
Q. Mr. Witness, is it your recollection that the upper echelon
tried or did its best to improve the food situation in your
commune?
A. The upper echelon issued instructions to the lower levels that
we had to resolve the food issue so that villagers could have
sufficient food to eat. And if a leader at the village or commune
chief level couldn't do it, then we would be in trouble. And for
that reason we tried very hard to resolve the problems <because I
was afraid of being arrested. There were arrests from time to
time>. And in certain cases, some people in the leadership level
would be removed from one position and transferred to others. As
in my case, I was transferred from Leay Bour to Srae Ronoung and
subsequently to Angk Ta Saom. <I did not know the reason behind
this transfer.>
Q. Mr. Witness, in your answer to the investigators at E35/521,
answer 100, the question is: "Did people die of starvation?" And
your answer is: "No one died of starvation." My question to you
is: Is it your testimony that also in the difficult period, 1975,
maybe 1976, no one died of starvation?
A. Yes, I did make that statement. People died of illness. Some
<>people <were not used to manual work especially people who came
from the cities,> and due to a sometimes shortage of food, they
<continuously> fell sick <and had fever>.
Q. I will get back to that topic, Mr. Witness. But just to be
clear, is it your testimony that your recollection in your
commune, nobody died of starvation, including in the years 1975
and 1976?
A. Yes, indeed. And as for those who died, they mainly died of
illness. And on the issue of food shortage, it could be one of
the many factors that made those people ill <and died
successively>.
Q. Mr. Witness, you would agree with me that also today in this
country and in all the other countries of the world, people die
of diseases. So also in 1975 and 76, people would die of
diseases. My question to you is the following: How would you be
able to establish there was any link between living conditions
and food shortages and the subsequent illness of people?
A. As I stated, people died of diseases. Maybe they died <from>
overwork, or<> the lack of food, <and these caused them to have>
personal illness.
Q. I understand, Mr. Witness, but you would agree with me that
people die, because of old age, because of diseases. So my
question to you is: Were you able, in your position as commune
chief, to determine whether there was any causal effect between
the living conditions or the working conditions, and the
subsequent death of these people?
A. I did not understand the cause of their death. And I stated
what I understood. They could die from the lack of food supplies,
or could be from over work, or poor sleeping quarters, or because
they died of old age. <People died continuously.>
Q. Well, that was my question. I understand that you are not a
demographic expert, but again, are you able to give us some
information as to the sources of knowledge of people dying in
your commune? Did you speak, for instance, to people of the
hospitals or other authorities in relation to sickness and death
of people?
A. I did not know for sure.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. I would like to turn to another
subject and it is your question in answer 31, in document
E3/5521. The question, Mr. Witness, of the Investigators is as
follows: "In your village how many people were called and taken
to study?" And your answer is -- I quote: "I did not know how
many because this was their secret story. And for the people who
were called to go and study they were never seen coming back."
What is it you exactly meant with "their secret story"? Could you
clarify, please?
A. I, of course, cannot tell you as to the <exact> number of
people who were called and they went and never came back. I, in
fact, was also called for re-education session and I was not
aware that I was about to be sent for execution, and only after
1979 when I went to visit Krang Ta Chan, I was shocked and I felt
regret for what happened.
Q. Did you just say, Mr. Witness, that you yourself was asked --
or sent for re-education during the DK regime?
A. As I said, when I was promoted to become the commune chief in
1978, I never sent anyone for re-education, but previously,
people were actually sent for the education. But I did not do
that in my position.
Q. Maybe I misunderstood your answer. I thought that you said
that you had yourself been sent for re-education, but that's, I
take, it is not true.
A. Personally, indeed, I was sent for a study session and I was
given <documents> so that when I returned back to my commune I
would implement what I learned -- that is, to increase rice
production, and that's what I mean by I also was sent for a study
session.
Q. So you came back and kept working after your re-education, or
study session rather. Do you know of any experience of other
people who went for a study session or re-education session and
came back into the commune?
A. After I attended the study session and asked for other people
or other villagers who were sent for the session they never
returned. But, in my case, I attended the study session, but the
purpose of such sessions were to, for us, in our capacity to
resolve the living conditions of the people <in the commune>, to
increase the yield production of rice <and to provide sufficient
food for people>, for example. That's what I did. And I also
would like to reiterate that, in my capacity as commune chief at
the time, I never sent any of the people in my commune for study
sessions or re-education.
Q. I would like to ask you something more about "they never
returned". Are you implying something with these words, "they
never returned", or are you simply saying that you don't know
what happened to them?
A. Indeed, I never saw them return.
Q. But when you say that, do you mean that you know what happened
to these people?
A. I did not know what happened to them.
Q. So, in your experience, would it be possible that they had
been sent to other communes, or other districts in the country?
A. I cannot say for sure because when they did that, it was
secretive. However, from my observation, when people were sent
for a study session, we could not say whether they were sent to
be killed or not, because what they did was secretive. Even I was
a commune chief, I did not know about that. I only knew that they
were sent for study sessions, or for study, and they never
returned.
Q. So is it fair to say that you are speculating when you say
"they never returned", implying that they might be executed, that
this is speculation?
A. It's because I didn't see them come back and it was my
personal experience or impression that they were executed.
Q. And you being the exception to the rule?
Mr. Witness, I would like to return to Krang Ta Chan now. You
said that you never saw -- that you didn't know of the existence
of this re-education centre. Is that correct? Not before 1979?
A. During the regime, I knew where Krang Ta Chan was and I heard
that it was called Krang Ta Chan Security Centre, but I was not
aware that people were executed there. However, after I concluded
my study session at Office 123, I was called to attend a ceremony
near Krang Ta Chan and when I visited the site I was shocked.
Q. So, your testimony is now that you knew during the DK regime
of Re-education Centre 105, but that you knew of possible
executions only after 1979. Is that a correct summary of your
testimony?
A. Yes, I knew about it for certainty after 1979 and I felt angry
about what they did. In fact, my younger sister was arrested and
one of my sons also disappeared, though I didn't know where he
was sent to <but they disappeared until now>. And of course I
felt <very> angry about that.
Q. My last question, Mr. President on this topic. Would it be
fair to say that you only knew of Krang Ta Chan as a possible
execution site after your re-education for a six-year period by
the Vietnamese?
A. I attended a ceremony at Krang Ta Chan and that's when I saw
it. After I was released from the refashion centre <or> office
163 at Kaoh Andaet, <I was> the deputy chief of a village <and I
was> invited<> to attend a ceremony near Krang Ta Chan and then
-- that was the time that I saw it personally.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The time is appropriate for a lunch break. We will take a break
now and we will resume this afternoon at 1.30. <Please be back in
the courtroom.>
And Court officer, please arrange the place for the witness <at
the waiting room for witnesses and civil parties> during the
lunch break and invite him and his duty counsel back into the
courtroom at 1.30.
And security personnel, you are instructed to take Mr Khieu
Samphan to the waiting room downstairs and have him back into the
courtroom this afternoon before 1.30.
The Court is now in recess.
(Court recesses from 1137H to 1333H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Court is now in session, and the Chamber
gives the floor to the defence counsel for Mr. Nuon Chea. I would
like to inform that the combined time for the two defence teams
is one whole afternoon. You may proceed now.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon, Your Honours.
Mr. Witness, before the break we were speaking about an answer
that you gave. I would like to follow up on that, and that is by
reading another answer that you gave earlier to Investigators --
that is, E3/5521, question 124. The question that the
Investigators asked you was the following: "For the period of
three years, did you witness any arrests of people?" Your answer
is: "The arrests were done confidentially. I never witnessed
them."
Q. My question is to you now: Could you elaborate this answer?
Did you never really see any arrests of people, ever?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. That is my true statement. I never witnessed the arrests. They
came at night-time after they got the reports. They came to
contact with the militia, and people were brought away during the
night-time, and it was very <secretive; that's why I did not
witness the arrests.>.
Q. Do you know what the reason was to be so quiet about arrests?
And why it happened at night-time?
A. From what I knew, the arrest took place at night-time because
they did not want to let ordinary people know about the arrests.
Q. Do you know, Mr. Witness, whether a distinction was made in
the period of DK between so-called minor crimes, on the one hand,
and serious crimes, on the other hand? Was there such a
difference, to your knowledge?
A. I could not give you my guess, or my prediction, how the two
were different, because I was not aware of the two.
Q. In your years in Nhaeng Nhang, as community chief, nobody ever
stole a coconut or cassava, for instance?
A. When I was in Nhaeng Nhang commune, it was not the commune, it
was the office. I was dealing in economics, and I never witnessed
any stealing of coconuts or of any other properties.
Q. Have you ever heard of people within your commune being
accused of stealing something because they were hungry?
A. I never witnessed, I never heard of it.
Q. Another topic that we already spoke about, and you spoke about
it earlier -- that is, re-education. That is a follow-up question
to a question before the break. Do you know of any instances of
people who were re-educated multiple times? People who were sent,
coming back, sent, coming back? You might have answered this
question already in other words, but I would like to make sure
what your experience was. Have you ever heard of people who were
sent multiple times for re-education?
A. I never witnessed people who were sent <for re-education>
multiple times. I knew that people were sent for re-education,
and they disappeared. For this instance, I have heard of.
Q. Very well. I would like to ask you another question on another
topic, Mr. Witness, and that is your statement E3/5521, your
answer to questions 25 and 27.
Question 25 reads as follows: "In 1975, did you see the
evacuation of people?"
And your answer is: "I saw people evacuated from the city. They
travelled along the road toward their individual birth districts.
In case people who did not have the birth district, they asked to
stay as citizens in that village or district."
And question A27: "When people came to live in the village, was
there any instruction plan?" "The upper echelon instructed to
have those people live in one location, either in the pagoda or
in the school. Later on, they were divided to go to the villages.
Upon arrival in the village, they ate commonly with the Base
People."
My first question, Mr. Witness, is about people who had come from
the city and travelled to what you called "individual birth
districts". How were you able to determine that people who came
from Phnom Penh actually had returned to their birth district?
A. Phnom Penh evacuees, they travelled along the road. They
<>pushed carts, <>some people were travelling by car, and they
had some small belongings. And there was the announcement that
those who came from which birth district <or province>, they
should go back to their birth districts.
Q. But in your years as commune chief of Nhaeng Nhang, for
instance, were you able to tell who, from the original evacuees,
had in fact returned to their birth district?
A. I once again would like to inform you that I was in the
office. I never became a commune chief <in Nhaeng Nhang>. People
from Phnom Penh were travelling along the <national> road <number
3> near my office. And they said they were from Kampot province,
and some said that they were from nearby villages. And I was told
that they were travelling to find their parents at their birth
place.
Q. I know it's a difficult question, but are you able to give a
percentage of people who had arrived from Phnom Penh? How many of
the people who you saw were in fact -- or had in fact returned to
their birth village?
A. At that time, I did not know how many of them, and I could not
give you the statistics. But I could see people were travelling.
I do not know how many families were travelling to their birth
districts. Some people were travelling to the west, to Kampot
province, and some were travelling <along road 31> to Tuk Meas.
So I could not tell you the percentage.
Q. I understand, Mr. Witness, but the reason I'm asking you the
question is because you yourself made the distinction. Could you
indicate whether the majority of the people coming from Phnom
Penh were in fact people who had returned to their birth
district?
A. I do not get your question. Please repeat your question<>.
Q. I'll move on, Mr. Witness. People who had come from Phnom
Penh, either returning to their birth district or not, were they,
in your knowledge, discriminated against because they were people
coming from Phnom Penh?
A. First, people were not discriminated. People from Phnom Penh
or from Takeo province, they were allowed to live in
cooperatives. At the beginning, there were no proper settlers,
and some people were living with their parents for a temporary
period of time, and some others were living in schools, in
pagodas, so they were eating <>communally, with the Base People
at that time, at the beginning.
Q. But were you ever instructed to treat the people who had just
arrived from Phnom Penh worse than the people who already lived
there? For instance, in terms of food or working conditions? Or
was everybody treated the same?
A. As I told the Court already, at the beginning, people were
treated equally. They were eating together. There were no clear
plans and there were no distinctions, at the beginning.
Q. So, in other words, no such policy from the upper echelon
existed? You were not instructed to make any distinction between
the people; is that correct?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please hold on, Mr. Witness. You may proceed now, International
Co-Prosecutor.
MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
I have an objection, Mr. President. The answer was as follows.
This witness said on two occasions that at the beginning, the
people were treated in the same manner. He didn't say <until what
point, nor did he make mention of any particular time frame>. And
this question asked is very general. <It speaks> in general terms
about <the treatment of> displaced persons without referring to
the specific period, and <I believe that> it is important for us
to know what that period is. Thank you.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Very well. Mr. President, I will specify.
Q. Mr. Witness, you've testified that there was no difference in
treatment between 17 April People or New People, and the Old
People. Was that the same for every year? Were the people treated
the same in 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. I do not really get your question. I would like to consult
with my duty counsel first.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is <>not a question which leads to self-incrimination. So your
answer may not lead to any prosecution against you. You may
consult with your duty counsel when it comes to the question
which leads to self-incrimination. After<> you got a question
from the Party, you may give your response. So your answer may be
the result of the statement you gave to Investigator of the OCIJ
in the past time.
MR. NUT NOV:
A. Thank you very much. As I informed the Court already, at the
beginning they were eating together. They were working <and
eating> together. And after that, people were put in different
groups. There were 17 April People group, and they were<> living
in different group from Base People.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. I understand. Thank you, Mr. Witness. But my question relates
more to discriminatory measures, treating one group more badly
than the other group. Your testimony was, I believe, no. But my
question is: Was there any change in treatment? Was the treatment
the same in 1975, '76, and '77, and so on?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. In 1975, as I said, people were equal. When it comes to 1976
-- late 1976, some people who were evacuated from different
places, they were put in the units, <which were different from
Base People>.
Q. Mr. Witness, do you remember an instruction in the summer of
1978 indicating that the division between Base People and 17
April People was to be abolished?
A. In 1978, I knew that the division was abolished, and there was
an announcement that people were to be treated equally, no matter
that they were 17 April People or they were Base People. The
division was abolished in late 1978.
Q. But how does that compare to your answer that people weren't
discriminated to begin with?
A. At the beginning there was no discrimination, and after that,
<>division of people were imposed. In late 1978, people were
again treated equally. It was prohibited that there was no
discussion of 17 April People, so people from 1978 were treated
equally.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. Last question: Do you know how many
people were living in Nhaeng Nhang commune in 1975-1976, by
estimate?
A. I was not aware of the numbers of people who were living in
Nhaeng Nhang. I did not have any statistics. Only the Commune
Committee knew about the statistics. <I was in the commune
office, so> I was not aware how many people, how many families,
households, how many families were living in Nhaeng Nhang.
MR. KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. Witness. Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now I give the floor to the defence team for Mr. Khieu Samphan to
put your questions to this witness.
QUESTIONING BY MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Thank you, Mr. President.
Q. Mr. Witness, I would like to seek your clarification on your
answer concerning the difference between commune committees and
commune office. You stated earlier already that you were dealing
with economics, food supplies, and so on. I would like to seek
your clarification. What were the cadres doing in the commune
office, and how was the commune office different from the Commune
Committee?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. Thank you very much. Commune committees were dealing with
administration. They were supervising people. For those who were
working in the office, the commune office, they were dealing with
food supplies. <At that time, there were soldiers in front
battlefield.> So, at the beginning, <there was no food supply.>
Communes and villages would come to seek a food supply from the
commune, and the commune chief would decide on food supply. And
Bun Sy was the former chief of the commune. I heard that <>he is
now living in Choam Khsant <in Preah Vihear province. I neither
met him nor knew anything. I just heard that>.
Q. What year are you referring to? <Could you tell the Court when
was the start and the end?>
A. I am referring to the period of 1975-1976. I did not know
whether in late 1976, or late 1977, he was sent to live in
Kampong Cham, and after Bun Sy, it was Ta <Sun (phonetic) called
Seum (phonetic)> who was the commune chief. And at that time I
left the commune already.
Q. You haven't told the Court concerning the people who were
working in the commune office. Could you tell the Court about the
members of the commune office <and their responsibilities>?
A. In the commune office there were only me and two messengers.
The two messengers would send a letter to request food or
vegetables from villages, and in the Commune <office> there was a
clerk to do the registry. And as for the clerk, he is deceased
<in 1979>.
Q. Thank you very much. Were you a member of the Commune
Committee at that time?
A. At that time I was not part of the Commune Committee. I was in
charge of the commune office, particularly in dealing with
economics, <however, the decision> to supply food for different
units in the communes <rested on commune chief>.
Q. Could you once again tell me the composition of the Commune
Committee? Perhaps there was a head of the Commune Committee,
there was a secretary or there was a clerk? Could you tell the
names <and the positions> of those who were in the Commune
Committee?
A. Thank you. Bun Sy was the head of the commune. And as for the
deputy, I did not know her surname. Her first name was <Mrs.
Thoeun> (phonetic). And <Tuy> Teav (phonetic) was the member. Ta
Chhoeun (phonetic) was also a member. And the clerk who wrote the
report was Mr. <Youv> (phonetic). He was deceased already. <Youv>
(phonetic) was not the member of the Commune Committee. He was
the clerk, dealing with the reports.
Q. Did <>your work dealing with the military affairs of the
commune office?
A. As I have stated, I was a soldier engaging in the battlefield
in Takeo, and that was in 1973. And later on, I became ill and I
contracted malaria, and then I was transferred to work at the
Nhaeng Nhang office. That happened in early or mid-1974.
Q. My question was about the commune soldiers. Were you involved
with the commune soldiers? <Did you use to be the chief of
commune soldier or any position in the commune?> I did not refer
to the time that you were a soldier in a <front> battlefield.
A. <Seng> (phonetic) was in charge of the commune soldiers, as
well as Chhoeun. He was the brother-in-law of <Bun> Sy. He is
currently living in <Neal village>, Tram Kak district.
Q. Let me clarify with you. So, you never worked or dealt with
the commune soldiers or army; is that correct?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please wait for the microphone to be operational
first.
MR. NUT NOV:
A. I already told you that I used to be a soldier in a
battlefield.
BY MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Q. I want you to clarify about the commune soldiers. Of course we
heard you talk about being a soldier in 1973 in a battlefield,
but I'd like to specify about the commune soldiers. Were you in
charge of commune soldiers' force somewhere in Takeo province?
<Or did you have any position in the commune soldier?>
MR. NUT NOV:
A. No, I did not while I worked at a commune.
Q. You were questioned by Judge Lavergne about Ta Hounh and that
you knew him. Did you ever work together with Ta Hounh?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please wait for the microphone to be operated first.
MR. NUT NOV:
A. At that time, Ta Hounh was chief of Leay Bour commune. And in
1976 or mid-1976, I was transferred to be there and I was a
member of the commune, and Ta Hounh was the chief. And there was
<Bou (phonetic)> who was his deputy.
BY MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Q. In your capacity as a member of that Commune Committee, what
was your responsibility?
A. As a member, I was assigned to deal with the dry season
farming at the Kampong <Youl, Tuol Sangkae>. And that was in
Treang district. I was also assigned to dig canals with other
workers.
Q. Did you have any specific responsibility? For example, as a
member of the committee, you were assigned to be in charge of
<culture>, or economics, or military affairs? Can you tell the
Court about <your specific responsibility as a member of commune
committee with Ta Hounh>?
A. The chief was in charge of all -- of overall affairs, and the
deputy was in charge of the economics, and a member in my
capacity, was in charge of culture.
Q. <How> can you recall, or <how can> you know <>that you were
actually assigned to be in charge of the culture as a member of
the Commune Committee?
PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please be mindful of the microphone.
MR. NUT NOV:
A. At that time, that was how it was assigned -- That is, a
specific duty for the chief, the deputy and the member of the
Commune Committee.
BY MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Q. So you were assigned in charge of culture, and what did you do
for that specific task or specific assignment?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. I advised each unit to teach young children. However, the
teaching was not formal. The intention was to teach children to
know how to read and to write alphabets. And it happened under a
house or under a tree. The teachers did not have any proper
qualifications, but only those who knew more than the ones they
taught.
BY MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Q. Were you the direct supervisor of teachers in Leay Bour
commune where you were a member and Ta Hounh was the chief, or
was it somebody else?
A. There were other teachers who were in charge. There was a
chief of the commune female group, <>who was directly in charge.
Q. And your duties, as the one who was in charge of culture? What
was your relationship between teachers and other cadres who dealt
with the cultural issue?
A. The relationship between the teachers and myself was that I
advised those teachers to try to work hard to teach <alphabets>
to those male and female children. And as I said earlier, when
those children had free time, they would go and collect cow dung
to make a natural fertiliser. So, it means they would engage in
this work for two to three hours, and attend class for one to two
hours.
Q. Did you receive any report on the outcome of the study of
those children?
A. Yes, I did receive a study report as they were done by those
teachers. At that time, teachers also received textbooks for
teaching.
Q. Since you received reports, can you tell the Court <about
student ability> whether by the end <of your work> those students
or children could read or write <in comparison to when you
started your work>?
A. Some children could read the alphabets; however, their
knowledge was rather limited.
Q. I have a general question to put to you on the principle of
the CPK. You actually stated that you were a candidate member of
the CPK and my question is the following: What principles or core
principles of the CPK that you learned <at that time>?
A. I'll respond to your questions based on what I can recollect.
As <a reserve> candidate member, the rights that we had were not
as equal as the ones who were recognized as full-rights members.
However, we could be in a leading position to lead people to work
at our base. For the full-rights members, they had the authority
to produce reports to the upper level -- that is, to the district
or to the sector level et cetera.
Q. My question is on the principle related to the policies of
CPK. Do you recall any major principles on those policies of the
CPK?
A. As I am now getting old, I cannot recall those principles.
There are only a few that I can recollect now -- that is, first,
to <resolve the living condition of> the people at our base;
second, to organize the work or the affairs inside the Party
properly.
Q. Can you elaborate a bit further on what the organization of
the work inside the Party rank, what do you mean by that?
A. <Internal principles were organized inside the Party.> This
implied that we had to be loyal to the CPK without straying or
without going offside and to strictly follow the political line
of the CPK.
Q. What about the food supply issue?
A. On this matter, at each base, we had to strive to deal with
the living conditions of the people and try not to encounter any
food shortage -- that is, to produce food sufficiently.
Q. This morning, at about 11.09 hours, you made a response and
let me quote that "the upper echelon instructed the commune level
to provide sufficient food to the people". On this issue -- that
is, the commune level was instructed to provide sufficient food
to the people, what measures did you take in order to ensure that
there was sufficient food supplied in your commune?
A. As I stated this morning, in Srae Ronoung communes that I took
charge, we organized various units; for example, a unit
responsible for planting vegetables and another unit to raise
livestock, including <chickens,> pigs and cows, and <there were>
cows which were raised in a <cooperative> and the cows <which
were put in one place>, and the economic section was assigned to
go and find fish as a supplementary daily food supply. And every
tenth day, I managed to give people meat to eat. Sometimes it was
pork and sometimes it was either beef or chicken. And <>almost on
a daily basis, the soup given to the people was that of a
vegetable mix with chicken.
Q. Can you also tell the Court about the food shortage in your
commune? What was the level of seriousness of food shortage? Was
it a severe food shortage, for example, or was it just a slight
and unnoticeable food shortage, that is based on your
implementation as instructed to ensure sufficient food supply for
the people in your commune?
A. Indeed, there was a food shortage, and in percentage, for
example, there were about 30 percentage of food shortage, as I
could deal with about 70 percent. Previously, Ta Khun, who was
the former commune chief <of Srae Ronoung>, did not raise the
level or percentage of food supply as well as I did during my
reign. <When I walked along each unit, I saw a lot of big and fat
pigs.>
And immediately, in fact, upon my arrival, I increased the food
supply based on the actual <food> situation <in the commune>. And
in fact, yes, previously they did raise livestock, but they did
not provide the meat from the livestock to the people in the
commune.
Q. You said that they did not resolve the living condition. Did
you mean that they raised the livestock, but did not share it
with the people?
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. And can you tell the Court why the commune chief who was there
before you arrived did not provide pork or beef or chicken to the
people?
A. Based on my observation, their solution to the problem was
limited, as only very little meat was given in the soup, because
the soup mainly consisted of vegetables. And that's what I saw
and that's what I learned from people in the various units. When
I asked them <in each cooperative>, they said that they did not
have enough food to eat.
Q. So, upon your arrival to be overall in charge of the various
communes that were worked with; namely Leay Bour, Srae Ronoung
and Nhaeng Nhang, what was the feedback from the people? Did the
people tell you that they had sufficient food to eat or food
shortage remained? That is, the general feedback from the people
when you went there to resolve this issue.
A. I did not receive any feedback while I was in Nhaeng Nhang
commune. And in Leay Bour commune, there was quite a severe
shortage, because that was a former battlefield, and for that
reason, I tried to resolve the issue <from time to time> by
working <on> the dry season farming and to organize units, to
engage in plantation, to produce cassava, <and yam> so <they>
could be used to mix with rice.
And while I was in Srae Ronoung commune in 1978, I again resolved
the living condition of the people there. In fact, there was food
storage. At economic section of that commune, <there were foods
available there> but they did not distribute it to the people.
But by the time I went there, I distributed the food to the
people. That's why they liked me and they told me that Ta Khun,
who was the former commune chief, <was very cruel>, and wherever
<he> went, people <in the cooperative> would just try to get out
of his way.
Q. Now I'd like to move to another subject. While you were in
Leay Bour commune, can you tell the exact time <from the
beginning to the end> when you were a member of that Commune
Committee <with Ta Hounh>?
A. I was in Leay Bour commune probably from mid-1976 to
late-1977. And in May 1978, I was transferred to take charge of
Srae Ronoung commune. And further on in late-'78, I was
transferred to be in charge of Angk Ta Saom commune, and I was
there for only two months before the regime fell.
Q. Were you aware of delegations from the upper echelon or from
the Centre to visit your area, in particular to visit Leay Bour
commune <while you were working there>?
A. While I was working there, after I was assigned by Ta Mok to
build a huge cooperative hall, Ta Hounh, the commune chief was
transferred to the North Zone and Ta <Ke> replaced him. There was
a Chinese delegation, <Chen Yonggui>, who came to visit that
cooperative, and Ta San was in charge of receiving that
delegation.
Q. Were you aware of visits by other delegations?
A. No, I was not.
Q. In relation to document E1/253/1, which was a transcript of
the hearing dated 27 January 2015, at about 14.03.46 seconds, a
civil party who testified before this Chamber spoke about your
presence and you were referred to as Ta Nov, because that civil
party did not know your full name. The civil party also stated
that <you were in charge of military and you had certain
positon>-- and let me quote:
Question: "You referred to Ta Nov in paragraph 25 of your
statement and do you know his full name and what was his
position?"
Answer: "His name was Ta Nov. He worked at the commune office
with Ta Hounh, but I do not know his full name. I only knew he
was known as Ta Nov. Everybody was afraid when he or she saw Ta
Nov. We had to work quickly because we were afraid of him as he
was rather cruel or strict." End of quote.
And also to add another extract -- a little bit above what I just
read to you -- <just two sentences above> in response to the
question:
"You also mentioned to the name of Ta Hounh. It was in fact Ta
Hounh. Do you know which position he held at the time?"
Answer: "His name was Ta Hounh and he was the commune chief who
was superior of Ta Nov, and Ta Nov was in charge of the commune
military." End of quote.
Can you tell the Court again whether you were in charge of the
military at the commune while you were a member of Ta Hounh?
A. While I was Ta Hounh's member, I was not in charge of the
military. It was Sout (phonetic) who was in charge of the
military affair, and I was merely a member of the Commune
Committee. <And I had fear, so when I saw old grandfather, I
always called them "Lok Ta".> Of course, people could make
various interpretation based on their observations. Some <>of us
were liked by other people; some were afraid of us, et cetera.
Q. Thank you very much. Could you clarify for the Court about the
<fear of the people>? <Did you have any reaction or explanation
regarding the activity or the treatment -- that you were acting
on people, which made them afraid of you>?
A. I always had a big voice <in an announcement> and I was normal
with people. However, during the meeting, I spoke very loudly and
I had big voice. That is why some people were afraid of me. What
I said was the truth, and I had loud voice, as I said.
Q. Thank you. Did you ever punish or reprimand people which could
show that you were cruel, that is why people were afraid of you
while you were working in Leay Bour <commune>?
A. I never punished or never reprimanded anyone. I had a loud
voice and I always encouraged people to work hard so that we
could solve our livelihood. Actually, as I said, I had loud
voice, and when I used the loudspeaker, my voice would even be
louder and people perhaps were afraid of me because of my voice.
Q. Thank you very much. When you were questioned by Mr. Koppe,
you stated that when you were in charge of the commune - when you
were head of the commune, you never arrested people. But when the
question dealt with the arrest, you said the arrests happened at
night time, during that time it was very quiet. Did you recall
your statement? And I would like to ask a question in relation to
this matter. Concerning the arrests at night-time, did it happen
when you were head of the commune <or before you became the
commune chief>?
A. I told the Court already the arrests happened during Ta Khun
reign. I secretly asked people and I was told that the people
were arrested at night-time while Ta Khun was in charge. When I
was transferred to Srae Ronoung, there was no arrest of people
for re-education.
Q. Please clarify your answer, Mr. Witness. You said that you
never arrested anyone for re-education. Did you want to say that
there were no arrests at all of people for re-education while you
were working in the Commune Committee in Srae Ronoung?
A. In Srae Ronoung commune, there were no arrests while I was in
the Commune Committee. When I was at Tuol <Kruos> digging the
canals, I knew that <> one or two <people> disappeared. At that
time, the unit of the district and sectors were in charge of that
area <in Tuol Kruos at Ou Saray commune>, and we were there to
dig canals, and the worksite was far away from Srae Ronoung.
Q. Concerning Srae Ronoung, did you know whom were <>arrested <in
which you were not related or it was not your order or you did
not join the arrest? However, were you aware of any arrest> while
you were working in Commune Committee?
A. I told the Court already, before there were arrests, but when
I was transferred to be in charge of that area, there were no
arrests.
Q. Thank you very much. I understand it well now. Could you again
clarify for me why was there difference between the way you
supervised Srae Ronoung commune and the way other people
supervised Srae Ronoung commune?
A. It depends on one's mind, because we have different minds in
the way we supervise. Some chiefs -- perhaps they were absolute
-- <and they followed "The Great Leap Forward">. And for me, I
was kind, I was gentle. So the methods that we supervised people
were different. In Srae Ronoung commune, I was in charge of
general tasks, so it was me who deal and engage in general tasks.
So, as I said, it depends on those who supervise and it depends
on their minds.
Q. Thank you very much. In relation to your testimony which you
have just stated now, you said that it depends on people's hearts
or people's mind. I would like to ask you whether there was a
policy from the upper echelon in relation to the administration
of the commune or did the communes have the authority <or
discretion> to supervise the commune on their own will?
A. There was order from the Centre to Zone to Sector to the
District, but some communes perhaps they did not follow the order
on some occasion, because the commune was close to the people and
if we followed whatever ordered from the top, the situation would
be confused. And for some matters, we would deal the matter
faithfully. And as I said, <many> commune chiefs <>were absolute,
so <we, as a leader, needed to have clear strategy to surpervise
the people>.
Q. Thank you. In relation to your answer just now, you said there
was an order from the Centre. What kind of order was it? Could
you give me an example in relation to such an order?
A. The order from the top required us to supervise our commune,
our cooperatives. We were asked to strive to deal with the
situation of the people, particularly in food supplies, and we
were asked to produce good yields, <three tons of rice> so that
we could solve the livelihood of the people <by what so called
the year 15>. And we were also asked and required to increase the
population among people. Some communes which could not deal with
all these matters, they were accused of reluctant to follow the
order of the Party. <As for me, I had fear and> I was working
very hard <day and night. I also had meal with people>. And at
that time, there was the plan set for people as well when they
had to visit their families <who were separated because> we were
afraid at that time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Counsel. It is now convenient time for a short
break. The Chamber will have a short break from now on until 3
o'clock.
Court officer, please facilitate a proper room for this witness
and for the duty counsel, and also for the reserve witness. And
please have this witness and his duty counsel back to the
courtroom before 3 p.m.
The Court is now <in recess>.
(Court recesses from 1444H to 1502H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Court is now back in session, and again,
I'd like to hand the floor to Khieu Samphan defence to continue
putting question to this witness. You have the floor.
BY MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Thank you, Mr. President.
Q. And Mr. Nov, before the break, we spoke about the policies of
the Communist Party of Kampuchea, and that you spoke about
instruction or guideline of providing enough food supply to the
people. And now, I'd like to ask you some questions regarding the
different stands of the cadres -- that is, those who were at the
base, <especially in your commune> as in your case. And you spoke
briefly about that. Can you also tell the Court about the
administration or the stands of the cadres at each district
level? And did you observe any difference from one district to
another in terms of management or administration?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. I cannot tell you that, in particular in dealing with the
details of this matter in each district.
Q. If you were to compare the situation in various districts or
in various communes that you worked, in particular the three
communes that you worked. Of course, you worked with cadres at
the district level. Did you work with the same cadres or did you
work with different sets of cadres at the district level?
A. There were different or various people at the district level;
namely and initially, there was Ta Keav (phonetic) and then there
was Ta Chim. And still later on, there was Ta Kit and Ta San who
was transferred from 108. And to my recollection, <>these were
the individuals that I worked with at the district level.
Q. Did you understand their position <from one cadre to another
cadre> in terms of the plan implementation, for instance? If you
don't understand, allow me to refresh it. Here, I refer to the
implementation of the CPK policies <as you mentioned earlier>.
A. I cannot make any conclusion on that. However, from my
observation concerning their leadership, Ta Chim and Ta San were
rather strict; <people listened to them>, and they were more
specific on the technical issues <because they were former
teachers, so they were firm>. However, besides that they were
kind of friendly and outgoing.
Q. Also concerning the CPK policies, did you experience or were
you aware of any instruction that you deemed was an inappropriate
policy that was imposed on the commune level and that you had to
implement it <regarding your responsibility as commune
committee>?
A. I cannot make any conclusion on that as I was not an expert in
making such an assessment.
Q. In relation to some individuals in your commune -- that is,
for instance, <you worked in commune committee> at the Srae
Ronoung commune, and that as you stated there was no arrest or
people were not sent for study session, and you said that some
cadres were very strict in the plan implementation. And my
question is the following: Were they strict <because> they <were>
fully compliant with the implementation of the CPK policies <or
they did not do so>-- that is, on trying to work hard to find
food for the people?
A. It was my understanding that everybody had a different working
style. Some people were absolute with the CPK principles, and
that was in conjunction with their personal working style. And
sometimes what they did was in excess of the requirement of such
a policy, <so it depended on the mind of that individual>.
Q. I have a last question to put to you. I actually asked you a
question about the delegation visits, and you said that there was
a Chinese delegation who came to visit once. And while you were a
member of the Leay Bour Commune Committee, did you ever see Pol
Pot accompanied any delegation for the visit of Leay Bour commune
<or any cooperative>?
A. I never saw Pol Pot coming to visit <the commune>. During the
one delegation visit, I heard Ta San spoke about Ieng Sary.
Though I did not know or know the physical appearance of Ieng
Sary. I only heard that Ta San talked about it.
Q. What about Khieu Samphan? <Did> you see Khieu Samphan come to
visit your cooperative or Leay Bour commune with a delegation,
for instance?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please observe the microphone.
MR. NUT NOV:
A. I only heard the name of Mr. Khieu Samphan but I never met him
and I never saw him.
BY MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Q. Did Khieu Samphan ever visit Leay Bour commune or cooperative
during the time that you were a member of the Leay Bour Commune
Committee?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. No, he did not.
MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Mr. President, I don't have any question for this witness and I'd
like to cede the floor to my colleague.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Mr. Vercken, you may proceed.
QUESTIONING BY MR. VERCKEN:
Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon, I am Mr. Khieu
Samphan's International Co-Lawyer, and I have a few <quick>
questions to ask you to complete today's work. A few moments ago,
you stated that the Party <called <on>> you to increase the
population and then to feed <that <increased> population>. And
<subsequently> you also talked about <people, cadres rather,> who
had "absolute power" <according to> the term that you used in
French.
Q. And my question is, these people who were exercising absolute
power, were they following the Party line in terms of the
<instructions> to increase the population and to nourish <that
population> or were they <acting> outside the Party line?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. Those who did, in fact, they adhere to the Party line. <They
were absolute with the Party.>
Q. Why do you say that their power was absolute? What exactly do
you mean when you say that?
A. As I stated, those people whom I say were absolute means that
they would carry out the full instruction imposed by the upper
echelon.
Q. What I don't really understand <however>, sir, is that if you
take it that the Party line was to increase the population and to
nourish it properly, then <ultimately such> absolute power <would
have been something positive>; is that <then> what you <mean by
that>?
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. Mr. Witness, I would like to come back to when you took up
politics, so to speak. When you were interviewed in 2009 by the
investigators from the OCIJ, you said that you were appointed as
a group head by the Khmer Rouge when they reached your region
which they took possession of, and you were then appointed as the
head of the group -- I think it was a mutual assistance group.
I'd like you to tell us why you were chosen. Was it because you
already were involved in politics, <with, perhaps, an ideological
leaning similar to that of the Khmer Rouge?> or was there another
reason for which you were chosen to lead that group?
A. At that time, I was appointed a group leader. In fact, before
that, I did not participate in any politics of the Khmer Rouge.
However, at that time, 12 families were chosen -- that is, those
who had the ability to read or to write. And in that case, those
people were selected to be group leaders for the mutual
assistance groups.
Q. <Would you consider it fair -- or indeed accurate to say that
these> mutual assistance groups <were, in a way,> the ancestors
of the cooperatives?
A. Yes, the mutual assistance groups <existed> before the
establishment of the cooperatives. At that time, young people
became soldiers, and those who were behind <were elderly people,>
the mutual assistance group <was organized for them> and we still
had the right to own our property and land. <They had not
collected those properties yet and there was the mutual
assistance group.>
Q. So the Khmer Rouge made you the head of the group without any
particular reason. You were chosen without really understanding
why they had selected you; is that the case?
A. After the coup d'état to topple Prince Sihanouk, in my area
that I lived, the Khmer Rouge came to take control. There were no
longer any Lon Nol soldiers in the area. For that reason, in
fact, I was actually forced to be <the leader of the> groups. And
as I was afraid of them, I just did what I was asked to do.
Q. Thank you very much. So just to be absolutely clear, you don't
know why you were chosen to be head of that group; is that
correct?
A. Yes, that is true. I did not know. And when they arrived, they
just appointed me to be in that position.
Q. Is it true that one of the duties of the mutual assistance
groups was to distribute food among the population?
A. The mutual assistance group would share the produce <of rice>
that we jointly made, but we ate privately -- that is, only with
our family members. And people were put into three different
categories -- that is, depending on their strength to work. For
example, for the first unit or the first group, it means the full
force, and the second one would be with the half force and the
third group would be the weaker one. And the produce would be
shared according to this level of strength.
Q. And did you get more food when you were strong or when you
were weak?
A. Yes, that is true because the full strength group will receive
more rice yield. So <> the rice yield would be distributed based
on the actual strength of the groups.
Q. When you were interviewed by the Investigating Judges in 2009,
you referred to difficulties in sharing out the <fruits of the>
harvest among these mutual assistance groups, you said that this
system was not particularly <egalitarian>. Can you tell us why
this system <of sharing which you just briefly touched upon>
wasn't very egalitarian?
A. As I stated, those who were stronger, even if the numbers of
the group was less would receive more yield than those who had
less strength, although their number was more than the first
group. And even if in certain cases, some individuals who were at
full strength receive more yields, but they had their family
members who were younger children or who with weak strength, for
that reason, they could not have sufficient food for their family
members.
Q. <Were solutions researched> to solve these problems? And if
<so>, what were the <solutions, according to what you observed,
that were implemented concerning this distribution> inequality?
A. It seemed there was no solution to the problem as, at that
time, the war was still ongoing <with Lon Nol>.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, it seems that your line of question is out of the scope
of the facts put before this Chamber for discussion. Please try
to put questions related to the facts within the scope of this
trial as well as the temporal jurisdiction of 17 April 1975 to 6
January 1979. Thank you.
BY MR. VERCKEN:
That's exactly what I was going to do with my next question.
Q. Mr. Witness, can the establishment of the cooperatives be
understood as being designed to provide a solution to this
difficulty in equal distribution of produce that you encountered
in the mutual assistance groups?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. On the issue of the establishment of cooperatives, I did not
have a deep understanding of it, as it was organised by the upper
echelon, and that people <who> had <children> joining <the army
and they were elderly parents in the rear battlefield, so the>
communal dining hall <was organized for them>, so we would eat
jointly <and there were evacuated people from the city>, and then
we would be in equal status <in each family>. While we were
working <in> the mutual assistance groups, the sharing was not
even, as some families would have more food to eat while others
did not <because there were a lot of elderly people in their
family and they could not find more food>. And because we were
Buddhist practitioners, we had to see this point. And some people
could not even go and find fish because they were in the elderly
stage of their age.
Q. Is it true to say that once eating <became a> communal
<activity>, the food was distributed more fairly?
A. Then I saw that people had an equal chance to join the
communal eating. <They ate food equally.>
Q. So, in terms of distributing meals, it was better; is that
true?
A. If we were to compare the food that we ate -- that is,
privately and commonly, people had different views. Some said
that <>they could eat more while they ate privately. But for
those who had more family members, prefer the common eating. <So,
I cannot make a conclusion which one was better.>
Q. All right. <I shall> now turn to another subject which
<concerns> the secret agents in the commune, that is how it was
translated for us anyway, "secret agents" --> and the arrests
that were made. In your written record of interview of 2009 <this
term "secret agents" is used as> -- or sometimes <used to define
what were "security men"> but there's also the term "secret
agents". <Anyway, it's a rather surprising turn of phrase. Be>
that as it may, <I would like for you to tell> us who <were> the
<arrest letters sent to> when there were letters. Were these
letters directly <addressed> to the secret agents themselves as
<I believe> you yourself said in <your WRI>?
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. And who were the letters from -- which authority sent <these>
arrest letters?
A. I did not see that letter. However, it was possible that the
letter could be sent from the district chief or from the
security. And this is purely my personal conclusion as I did not
see it personally.
Q. <Okay, precisely what> surprises me is that in your <first WRI
from> 2009, E3/5521, in <answer to> question 42, you were asked
how you are aware of all of these things since you <hadn't> seen
the actual letters, and you say - <I shall quote you directly
sir, answer 42>: "I knew because the <secret agents drafted
reports for> the commune." End of quote. And so my question is:
Why didn't the secret agent report to those who sent them the
letters rather than reporting to the commune, which was not
behind the original initiative?
A. The commune militia reported to the commune and also, they
made a copy and reported to the security. And that is in relation
to the security situation or matter that happened within the
commune.
Q. And security, that was the district, was it?
A. The security would be in charge of this matter. I did not know
whether they were the sector or the district. <But I just knew it
was in Krang Ta Chan.> Actually, the Tram Kak district was in
charge.
Q. <Very well sir>. Coming back once again to the question of
food, local cadres such as yourself <for example>, were you fed
in the same way as the rest of the <population? In the same way
as those> in the units, for example?
A. Local cadres and people were eating in the same cooperative.
We had the same food. During a special occasion, <such as
meeting>, perhaps we had surplus in relation to the food.
Q. And was that surplus reserved for the cadres?
A. Yes. The surplus was for those who were in the meeting, but
<>this did not happen very quite often.
Q. Did you ever hear of the existence of a black market <for>
food under the Khmer Rouge regime? Was there any trafficking of
food?
A. I never heard of it.
Q. You told this Chamber <but also in your> -- I will backtrack a
little, sir. <I'm being told that my> question on <the black
market perhaps> wasn't very clear; I'll ask it again <to be
sure>. During the Democratic Kampuchea regime from 1975 to 1979,
in the three communes in which you worked, did you ever hear of
the existence of some kind of trafficking or exchange <of> food?
<Was there any bartering of food for other commodities? Did
anything of that nature take place? Money was no longer
circulating at that time. Of that, we are aware, but was there an
alternative way to go about procuring food>?
A. I never heard of this matter.
Q. You explained to this Chamber as well as to the
Co-Investigating Judges' Investigators that you concealed part of
the surplus rice produced in your commune. And I would <like> to
ask you how you did it because you explained that <at the same
time> you had to issue reports on rice production in the
district. You said that you lied in those reports <that's true>
but <I imagine that> there must have been some kind of audit.
<Physically, how did you manage> to conceal <this> rice <that you
did not declare>?
A. As I told this morning, for example, we had the produce of
rice for a certain amount for 1,000 bags, I would report only 700
bags to the top, and the 300 would be kept in the barn or in the
warehouse. And <>the district never came to check and to verify,
we would keep those surplus so that people could have enough food
to eat. I was afraid that the upper echelon would know about the
surplus which I kept in the barn or in the warehouse. People in
my area, they were friendly <with me> and we kept <the rice yield
secretly and the district never came to check>, as I said, and I
would report only the amount that I said earlier.
Q. Yes, I understand <that fine> sir. But still in that first
<WRI, E3/5521 in answer to question 81>, you explain that the
district came to look for <the> rice after you declared the
quantities produced and that is why I wanted to ask this
question. If the districts came to look for rice in the
warehouses and you hid some rice <that wasn't declared in these
very warehouses as you have just told us>, it means that <either
the> districts <turned a blind eye to such practices or that they
were ignorant to them or that you indeed hid the rice elsewhere>.
Can you be more specific on how <that transpired>?
THE INTERPRETER:
The document was E3/5521.
MR. NUT NOV:
A. Later, the district and the sector came to collect the surplus
based on the report because they had a report and the report said
that certain amount could be provided <according to the number of
people per commune>. So the sector and the district came to
collect the certain amount of the rice that we kept in the
warehouse and search was not conducted at that time.
BY MR. VERCKEN:
Q. I just want to be sure that I have properly understood your
testimony. You're telling us that you were caught and <that in
the end> the sector <or> the district came to get the rice you
didn't declare; is that correct?
MR. NUT NOV:
A. <>I would like you to clarify your question once again because
I could not get it clearly.
Q. My question has to do with the practical method whereby you
concealed part of <your commune's> rice yield in order to improve
the living standards of your fellow inhabitants. You stated that
you sent <reports> to the district <and, in order to> conceal
part of the rice harvest, in these reports, you would declare a
yield that was lower than the real harvest. I asked you where you
kept that part of the rice yield that you did not declare. Where
did you keep that surplus? In fact, you stated that that surplus
was kept in the warehouse, but you also stated that the district
came to fetch the part that you declared. <It> appears to me
that, <when it> <came> to take the declared yield, the district
could observe that you were keeping a surplus <and then ask
questions about that surplus>. <That is why I am asking you how>
did you manage to conceal that surplus?
A. I would like to clarify on these points. The rice yield, as I
said, was kept in the warehouse in the respective cooperatives.
Actually, the district had <>the data in the report concerning
the rice yield to be provided to people <and to the sector>. So
the district would come to fetch only the rice yield as stated in
the report. The female units and the male unit would come to
collect <rice yield; for example, 200 tons of rice, from Srae
Ronoung. And the rest would be used to supply to the living
condition of people.>
Q. Very well. I fully understand your answer and I'll sum it up
as follows. Those who came to collect the declared quantity were
not concerned about <the surplus rice on the site> is that
correct?
A. They did not concern about that. They came to fetch only the
amount that they were asked to fetch <for each commune>.
Q. I have two more topics to broach with you <sir>. The first has
to do with the "Revolutionary Flag". What <can you tell us about
the> "Revolutionary Flag"? <What was it?> Did you receive it
often? Occasionally?
A. "Revolutionary Flag", I never saw it and I did not understand
why they had "Revolutionary Flag".
Q. <Although> you <did> not understand what its purpose was, you
<still understood> what it was, didn't you?
A. I did not know what it was either. I only knew that, <at that
time,> the flag was depicted with the three towers of Angkor Wat.
Q. I will make my question more specific, Mr. Witness, because <I
think there is> a mix up. When I talk of the "Revolutionary
Flag", I'm talking of the journal of the Khmer Rouge which bore
the title "Revolutionary Flag" <and I am not referring to the
national flag itself.> Did you know about <this journal>? Did you
read it? <What was it about?> Did you often receive it?
A. I never received the "Revolutionary Flag". I was not provided
with <>any copies. Perhaps the upper echelon received
"Revolutionary Flags". <As for me, I never read it.>
Q. My last question has to do with the subject on which questions
were put to you this morning. It has to do with commune
secretaries. This morning you explained that you yourself <were>
assisted by a commune secretary, and that in each commune, there
was a secretary. You stated that you yourself needed one because
you were on the worksite most of the time. <I would like to know
-- you explained <that among the tasks> of the commune
secretaries, <that drafting reports figured highly>. My question
is as follows: <at the end of the day when> you returned from
work on the worksites <on which you allegedly worked, according
to what you have told us,> did you have the time to <reread> all
those reports and to correct them before sending them to the
authorities who <were due> to receive them?
A. The reports <>were produced and drafted by the clerk. <They>
were never read or corrected by me. If it was said that the
report was correct, it would be sent to the district right away.
Q. Very well. But who cross-checked the reports to make sure they
were correct?
A. The drafter would do the verification.
Q. So, it is correct to say, sir, that the commune secretary <had
a certain degree of autonomy in terms of> the manner in which he
or she operated?
A. Yes, that is correct.
MR. VERCKEN:
I have no further questions, Mr. President. Thank you, Witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
