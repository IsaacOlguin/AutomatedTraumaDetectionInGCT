and I was sent to Sala Lekh Pram.  I spent overnight there before
I was taken by a truck to Phnom Penh, and I conducted training at
the technical school at Prek Thnaot.
Q. Angkar sent you to Sala Lekh Pram in Kampong Chhnang where you
trained.  Do you remember when exactly was it?
A. I don't remember.  I was so young at that time.  I could just
follow the others and I didn't remember the date.
Q. How old were you when you started at the technical school at
Prek Thnaot?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you please be reminded again that only respond to my
question when the light on the mic is on otherwise you are only
talking to yourself, and no one can listen to you.
When you received training at Prek Thnaot Technical School, how
old were you?
A. I was 11 years old.
Q. How long had you attended the trainings at Prek Thnaot school?
A. For about three months.
Q. After receiving such training at Prek Thnaot for that
duration, where were you sent to next?
A. After that, I was sent to work in a child unit somewhere near
Phnom Penh; I don't remember where it was.  I was made to carry
dirt or soil.
Q. You were taken to do farming, to build dykes, and to work
somewhere near Phnom Penh.  So how long were you working at that
new location?
A. I had worked for a certain period of time.  It's quite long
enough, but I don't remember when or how long it was before I was
taken to work at S-21.
Q. Do you remember when did you arrive at S-21?
A. I don't remember the month, but I know for sure that I was
sent there by 1978, and I worked there as a child medic to
distribute medicines to detainees through the adults.
Q. When you came to S-21, at the beginning what was actually the
name of the location?  Was it originally called S-21?
A. I was not told anything about the location and I only learned
of the name when I had spent some time working there already
because I was too young.  I only learned of the name after I had
worked there for quite some time already.
Q. You left S-21 you said, and when did you leave it?
A. There was gun fighting or the gun sounds and then we heard the
artillery and then we left.
Q. Let us move back a little bit to the time when you were
assigned by Angkar to work at S-21.  Could you please tell us
about your duties at that premises?
A. I worked as a child medic to distribute medicines to detainees
and I had to be in the company with the adults who worked as
medics too.
Q. Did you write and read back then?
A. No, I didn't.
Q. Do you write and read now?
A. Yes, I do.  I can read and write significantly now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judges of the Bench, would you wish to put questions to this
witness?
Judge Thou Mony, you take the floor.
BY JUDGE THOU MONY:
Q. Mr. Sek Dan, you stated that when you came to S-21 you were
assigned to distribute medicines to detainees with the accompany
of the adults.  During your work, before you started distributing
medicines, were you trained on medical matters?
A. I was not trained.  I was assigned to only distribute the
medicines and as advised by the adults, and I knew for sure that
at that time there were nothing but the rabbit pellets medicines.
Q. Did you have to distribute medicines into all buildings at
S-21?
A. I was assigned to distribute medicine to house number 3, or
Building 3, only.
Q. What about the other buildings?  Were you also asked to
distribute medicine to those buildings?
A. There were other groups.  Two persons were assigned to
distribute medicine to one building at that time.
Q. How many medics were there at S-21?
A. There were some adult medics and later on they had been
arrested.  For example, my chief of the team, Mr. Pao, was also
arrested.
Q. You said many medics when you came, so how many were many?
A. There were two chiefs of mine.
Q. Do you remember their names?
A. They were Pao and Yeun.
Q. How many were the child medics in your team?
A. There were four of us:  Thim, Mon and Hov.
Q. Among the child medics at S-21 were there female medics?
A. There were two male medics, Pao and Yeun.
Q. What about female medics?  Were there any of them?
A. No, there weren't.
Q. When you came to work at S-21 did you know who supervised
S-21?
A. The supervisor of S-21 was Duch.
Q. Did you know Duch clearly?
A. I did not know him that well.  I only occasionally saw him
from a distance.  I was quite young at the time and I did not
dare to look at his face.  He was the big boss.
Q. Besides Duch, did you know any other leaders or supervisors at
S-21?
A. Those leaders, subordinates to Duch, I did not know them.  I
only knew him.
Q. You went around dispensing the medicine to the sick people or
to the sick prisoners.  Can you tell us the situation of the
detention of those prisoners in the building where you went
around dispensing the medicine?  What was your observation
regarding their detention?
A. They had wounds and sores on their bodies, especially on their
backs.  They had their fingernails missing.  And for those
prisoners who protested, they would be tortured by the guards'
chief.  They were cuffed or chained for both the legs and the
hands.  And for those who did not protest, only one leg was
shackled.
Q. They were shackled and cuffed in the detention rooms.  How
many people were detained in one room?
A. On the upper floor in those common rooms a lot of prisoners
were detained.
Q. You went distributing the medicine to the sick prisoners.
What types of diseases or sickness did they have?
A. Most of the prisoners had diarrhoea or fever or headaches and
majority of them had wounds on their backs.  Some of them had
their fingernails or toenails missing.
Q. So it meant the prisoners whom you treated were sick due to
the tortures inflicted upon them.  Is this correct?
A. The majority of them, yes, they were tortured.  They did not
have common diseases.  They were sick because they were tortured.
Q. What types of medicines were given to the prisoners?
A. For diarrhoea they would be given the medicine for the
treatment of diarrhoea.  For those who had wounds, they would be
given the medicine for the treatment of the wounds, but most of
the medicines were rabbit pellets.
Q. For those who had wounds, did they have their wounds cleaned?
A. Yes, they had their wounds cleaned with the saline water in
order to make it recover quicker.  Sometimes the wound was not
yet recovered and they were taken out and disappeared.
Q. Let me go back a little.  When you came to work at S-21 did
you live inside the compound of S-21 or you lived outside?
A. I lived in a wooden house and all the child medics stayed
there.
Q. Where was that house located?
A. It was to the northeast of the building.  I did not know the
street number.  It was to the north of the main entrance to the
prison.
Q. What was the house made of?
A. On the ground floor it was a concrete and it was wooden on the
upper floor.
Q. So it means it was concrete on the ground floor and it was
wooden on the upper floor.  Is this correct?
A. That is correct.  It was concrete on the ground floor and
wooden on the upper floor.
Q. You said those people who had wounds were those who were
tortured, as they had wounds or sores on their backs and they had
broken fingernails or toenails.  Did you ever see the prisoners
being tortured?
A. I did not see the torture personally.  The interrogation team
was separate and the guards' team was separate and the child
medic team was also separate.  I only provided the treatments to
them in the building.
Q. For those people who were interrogated, where were they
interrogated?
A. They would be taken to various locations based on their own
team.  For the elder people, they would be taken to different
locations and I, the child medic, would only stay at the
building.
Q. How did you know that the wounds were the result of being
tortured?
A. Because at night I heard the screaming and I saw the sores and
the wounds.  So when I provided a treatment, I asked them how did
they get the wounds and the sores and they replied to me that
they were being interrogated.
Q. So you knew because you asked the prisoners by yourself.  Is
this correct?
A. I personally asked the prisoners the reason for them to have
the sores or the wounds on their bodies.  So when I cleansed the
wounds, I asked them the questions.
Q. You said you provided the treatments and went around
dispensing medicine to the prisoners.  Did you also provide a
treatment to the S-21 staff who were sick?
A. If they were sick and they asked for the medicine, I would
dispense the medicine to them, yes.
Q. The medicines dispensed to the prisoners who were sick and to
those who were the S-21 staff, were the medicines the same?
A. They were provided with the same medicines for the same kinds
of illnesses.
Q. Let me talk about the child medics whom you just described.
Can you tell us again the four names of the child medics; what
were their names?
A. Yes, they were Mon, Hou, Thim and I, myself, Dan.
Q. You said there was a medic named Mon.  Was the medic Mon male
or female?
A. Mon was male.  He was a child who stayed and worked with me.
There were four of us, the child medics.
Q. So Mon also came from the same village as yours; that is, from
Kampong Chhnang?
A. Yes, he came from Kampong Chhnang, from the same village.
Q. He was male?
A. Yes.
Q. When you worked at S-21, did you ever see prisoners being
walked or taken out for interrogations or being taken out
elsewhere?
A. Prisoners were taken to be interrogated during the daytime,
and I was wondering what happened to those old prisoners and why
the new prisoners came in and why sometimes the prisoners had
more wounds on their bodies.  And in the morning when I sometimes
went to provide the treatment, they were gone.
Q. So some prisoners disappeared, and did you know from the time
the prisoners arrived until the time you provided the treatment
and until later on they disappeared, how long had they stayed
before they disappeared?
A. Some stayed there longer, for a month or two months or three
months, depending on the allegations on them or on their network.
I was not really sure on this matter.
Q. Did you know that within the S-21 compound -- that is, within
the compound of the school -- was the interrogation location
located inside the compound?
A. In S-21 Office, there was no interrogation room.  They were
taken out to be interrogated; they were not interrogated inside
the compound.
Q. At the detention facility where you dispensed the medicines to
the prisoners, were there any female prisoners?
A. Most of the prisoners were male.  I did not see any female
prisoners.
Q. Did you ever see any foreign prisoners, for example,
westerners or Vietnamese prisoners?
A. I did not see any foreign prisoners as they might be housed
separately in different buildings, I think Building 1 or 2, and
as I only worked in Building 3 and there were no foreign
prisoners there.
Q. What was the food ration given to the prisoners?
A. Only one bowl of gruel was given to each prisoner and those
who worked inside the prison were asked to distribute the food to
the prisoners.
Q. During the time that you worked over there, did you know if
prisoners were taken to have their blood drawn?
A. I did not see any prisoners taken away to have their blood
drawn.
Q. What about the medical experiments, were there any medical
experiments conducted on prisoners at S-21?
A. I was a child medic, I did not know this.  Maybe the adult
medics knew about this.
Q. You said there were adult medics and, later on, they were
arrested and taken away.  Did you know the reasons for the
arrest?
A. For the adult medics, they had made some mistakes.  For
example, there was a reaction to the medicines that was injected
or the tablets that were given to the prisoners, and they were
accused of being the enemy.
Q. Did you know who ordered for the arrest of those adult medics?
A. I would say that would only be Duch who ordered the arrest of
those adult medics.  They were arrested at night and next morning
they all disappeared.
Q. In S-21 Office, you worked there and until when did you leave?
A. I stayed there until the day I fled when there was gunfire.
Q. So it means you worked at S-21 until the 6 or 7 of January
'79.  Is that correct?
A. That is correct.  We fled on the 6th or the 7th and we
separated from the rest.  We were child medics, we left first and
the older people they stayed behind and they left later.
Q. So you stayed and worked at S-21 for almost a year, did you
ever attend any political training session?
A. Regarding any major political training session, no, I did not
attend any.
Q. What about smaller group meetings, did you attend?
A. For small group meetings or for three monthly meeting, yes, I
used to attend those meetings for criticism and self-criticisms.
Q. What was the content of the meetings?
A. They talk about hygiene, about working hours, and strict
working discipline.
Q. During the time that you provided treatment to the prisoners
did you see any prisoners who were sick and died in the detention
facility?
A. There were prisoners who were sick and died and, yes, I did
see them.
Q. During the time that you worked there how many prisoners died
due to illnesses?
A. During the time that I worked there, there were many of them,
probably up to hundreds.
Q. What happened to the bodies of those prisoners who died of
their illnesses?
A. We, the child medics and the medics were asked to carry those
bodies and buried them in the vicinity of the compound.
Q. Did you know the locations where the bodies were buried?
A. They were buried to the west of the building and also at the
surrounding vicinity of the compound.  That was for only
individual prisoner who died.
JUDGE THOU MONY:
Thank you, Mr. President; I do not have any questions for this
witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judges of the Bench, do you have any questions?  Judge
Cartwright, you may put your questions to the witness.
JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:
Q. Sek Dan, did you know what was in the medications that you
gave to the prisoners or to the staff?
A. Those medicines were locally produced; they were known as
rabbit pellet medicine.  They were black in colour.
Q.   Thank you.  And the rabbit pellet medicine, was that
medicine that was commonly used in Cambodia before the time of
the regime?
A. They were only produced after 1975.
Q. Do you know what was in that rabbit pellet medicine?
A. The rabbit pellet medicine, I did not know the substance to
make the medicines; they were only produced and distributed to us
for the dispensing to the prisoners.
JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:
Yes, thank you, President, I have no other questions of this
witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Lavergne, you can proceed with your questions.
BY JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Q. Hello, Mr. Dan, could you tell us how many different kinds of
medicine were available to you in the pharmacy?  How many
different kinds of medicine were there?
A. The types of the medicines that are dispensed to the prisoners
they were those medicines for the treatment of the wounds, the
diarrhoea and the headache.
Q. All of this medicine was it always rabbit pellets or were
there different kinds of medicines, other than the rabbit
pellets?
A. There were some other medicines too and delivered in different
forms except from the rabbit pellet medicine.
Q. Was this medicine that had been made in Cambodia or did this
medicine come from outside of Cambodia?
A. From what I understood I also actually tested the medicine
because sometime when I was hungry I also ate those medicines and
some of them had a sweet taste and some of them had a bitter
taste.  I think they were made locally.
Q. Did this medicine have any effects and did it really cure
people or did they have no effect whatsoever?
A. Those medicines could provide some treatments, some of them
were effective and some were not.  I actually ate a handful of
those medicines and it did not have any effect on me; I ate those
medicines because I was so hungry.
Q. You said that you noticed many injuries.  Could you describe
this a bit more in detail, what kind of injuries did you notice
among the prisoners and where were these injuries located, on
which part of the body?
A. The wounds and the sores that I had, like I said, mostly they
were on the backs and on the arms and the legs of the prisoners.
Q. Did you see any burn marks, any scars from burning, any kind
of lesions that might have resulted from the usage of electric
shocks for example?
A. Regarding the lesion, yes, I saw them and I actually asked a
prisoner who had lesion on their body.  There were bruises and
there were some wounds with fresh blood.  There were all kinds of
wounds and sores.
Q. Did you notice lesions by the ears, for example -- next to the
ears?
A. I saw some lesions on the ears and some of the ears of the
prisoners were torn, and I saw this when I provided the
treatment.
Q. Did any prisoners have lesions next to their genitals?
A. I did not see it because they wore pants.  Actually, they wore
shorts and some of them were topless.
Q. Did you gather any confessions from the prisoners regarding
the different forms of violence that they had been subjected?
Did they ever confide in you and say that they had been beaten?
Did they tell you that they had received electric shocks?  Did
you hear about the usage of pliers as a torture instrument?
A. I did not dare ask them in details.  I was afraid that I would
be seen by the guard and, if so, I would be dead.
Q. You were not allowed to ask any questions?  You could not ask
them where they were feeling pain, in which part of the body they
were feeling pain, and know why they were feeling this pain?
A. I used to ask them to what's wrong with them, to what illness
they had, and then after they replied then I just provided the
medicine to them.  I did not ask many questions to each prisoner
because I was afraid that I would be accused.
Q. Fear.  Was fear something that was there on a permanent basis?
You said that you had seen adults being arrested.  Can you tell
us if you were aware of any cases of suicide among the medical
personnel?
A. They were too fearful, like Yeun who hanged himself to death.
He was the chief of my unit, my team; the new chief.
THE INTERPRETER:
The interpreter apologizes, but the question was not audible.  If
the Judge could please repeat?
BY JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Q. Do you remember why he was hanged?
A. I knew it because he was the chief of my team and he feared
his death, like what happened to Pao, the former chief, because
Pao had been arrested for the same allegation and that he made a
mistake by injecting some kind of injection into the detainee to
lead to their death.  That's why he was so fearful and he
committed suicide.
Q. A while ago, you talked about your participation in
self-criticism sessions.  What happened when during these
sessions it was said that one of you was not doing his or her
work properly?  What were the consequences of these sessions and
these criticisms?
A. At my medic unit, we were asked to attend such a session to
only be instructed how the sanitation would be applied, and if we
did not follow the rules then we would be removed.
Q. When you said you were set aside, what does that mean?  Does
it mean that you were arrested?
A. Removal means being taken away.
Q. And what happened to those who were removed, did you see them
again?
A. People who had been taken away would disappear.
Q. What were you told concerning the prisoners?  Were you told
not to talk to them too much?  What were you told?  Were you told
to heal them?  Did you heal prisoners or did you keep them alive
or, at least, try to keep them alive?
A. The medicine would be given to them to make them alive for the
period until they would have been interrogated.  That's all.
Q. So what were the orders that you received; what were you told?
Was it just to keep them alive until they were interrogated; was
that the instruction received?
A. I did not receive such orders, but normally after such
treatment then the people I gave the medicine to disappeared, so
I realized for sure that these people disappeared gradually.  And
when the old people disappeared, the newcomers kept coming.
Q. Did you see the accused here present in this courtroom from
the start?  Have you seen him since or did you see him since?  Do
you recognize him today?
A. I now see him in the courtroom.
Q. In response to a question put by Judge Thou Mony, you said
that you never dared to look him in the face.  Does he still
frighten you today?
A. I am now quite mature.  I get older now and since living in
this current society, I am not fearful of him any longer.
Q. You left your family when you were 14 years old.  Is that
correct?
A. I left my family to live in Phnom Penh when I was 11 years
old.
Q. Eleven years old.  Did your family agree to this?  Did you
have a choice or was this a situation where you were forced?
A. It was not the terms like "force" used at that time.  It was
about assignment and we had to accept the assignment.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
I have no further questions for this witness.  I'd like to thank
the witness.  However, I'd like to know whether the accused
agrees that the witness here present was a member of the S-21
medical services.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The accused, please respond to Judge Lavergne's question.
THE ACCUSED:
Your Honours, in the history of S-21, I requested the teenagers
from Kampong Chhnang to work at S-21.  There were about 40 of
them.  Having looked and heard the educational background of Sek
Dan and his memory, I can accept that he was the child sent from
Kampong Chhnang, and his memory is rather low and I would like to
give you an example in his testimony just now.
He said that he is now 48 years old, in response to Your Honour's
question, so was that the year 1961 that he was born?  But with
Judge Thou Mony he said he came to S-21 when he was 11 years old,
and then he was confirmed by Judge Lavergne and he said that he
was 11 years old back then.  So if he was 11 years old when he
was working at S 21 at the first place, then he would have been
born in the year of 1964.  I do accept that his educational
background is low, so is his memory, but then if he gives this
testimony differently regarding his birth.
He talked about Comrade Pao, who was the chief of medics at S-21.
It is true that Pao was the chief of the medical service at S-21,
and Pao was arrested in mid-1976 or early 1977.  So by way of
saying that Sek Dan came to S-21 at '78, it would not be correct
because at that time there were Comrades Rin and Try who were
very close to my supervision and asked him to take the blood to
Hospital 98.
And this testimony makes me suspicious that Sek Dan may not have
been the staff of S-21 and he said that he only know me at S-21
and not Mam Nai.  At least he should have known Peng because Peng
was very famous at that time at the location.
So in this conclusion, with this kind of testimony I feel that I
am very suspicious that Sek Dan may not have been the staff
member under my supervision at S-21, but I would like to request
that there should be further documents to support the list of
staff members at S-21 to make sure I can accept that Dan was the
former staff member at S-21, and the prosecutor can assist us
with this.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would like to now give the floor to the prosecutors to proceed
with questions to the witness.  The prosecutors have 15 minutes
for such purpose.  The floor is yours.
MR. TAN SENARONG:
Thank you, Mr. President.
QUESTIONING BY THE CO-PROSECUTORS
BY MR. TAN SENARONG:
Q. Good morning, Mr. Sek Dan.  You indicated before the Chamber
briefly already that you attended trainings at the technical
school at Prek Thnaot.  What were the trainings about at that
time?
A. We were trained to crawl to fire the guns and to dissemble the
guns.
Q. Thank you.  Before the Co-Investigating Judges on the July
2008, with ERN number 00163815, D28/16, you said that during the
trainings there were people who complained that they did not have
enough to eat and there were too much training.  And later on he
was accused of the counter-revolutionary enemy and was arrested
and disappeared.
So could you tell the Court whether you remember any names of
those people who were arrested during the trainings with you?
A. There were people from other units who were arrested, not the
people in my unit.
Q. Thank you.  In the same interview on the 16th of January 2008,
the same ERN number, you said that there were about 100 children
who were assigned separately to work at S-21.  Do you remember
having seen any female children who worked with you, or were
there any female children who came from the same home town like
you?
A. There were two children from my home town -- Son, Path, who
were bigger than me or who were older than me back then.
Q. Were there any female children?
A. No, there weren't.  There were only male children.
Q. Thank you.  In the same interview you indicated that the child
medics survived and the adult medics died or killed, so do you
remember where those adult medics were from?
A. I have no idea where they were from because I saw them working
there but I did not know where they came from.
Q. Thank you.  In the same statement but on , you
said you saw Vietnamese soldiers with the military uniforms and
civilian clothes was being taken in and you believed that these
Vietnamese detainees were subjected to torture too.  Do you stand
by the statement now?
A. I did say so and I did see the people with military uniforms
but I don't know whether they were Cambodian or Vietnamese.
Q. Thank you.  Did you ever witness any tortures being inflicted
onto those Vietnamese people?
A. The Vietnamese prisoners were not put into the building I was
assigned to work in.
Q. You said the other colleagues told you about blood drawing.
Who were they, the people who told you about these incidents?
A. They were my colleagues, the same child medics who worked with
me who shared this information with me, but I was suspicious of
how blood would have been drawn back then.
Q. Thank you.
MR. TAN SENARONG:
With the President's leave, could ERN number 00181396 be put up
on the screen?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The AV Unit, could you please put this document 00181396 B48/2 on
the screen as requested by the prosecutor?
BY MR. TAN SENARONG:
Q. Mr. Sek Dan, the picture, the photo, right in front of you
here is the location of S-21; the buildings A, B, E, C and D.
And in Khmer we have already -- so could you please indicate in
which building you were assigned to work in?  So these buildings
are now facing east, so behind these buildings then it is the
best direction.  So could you please indicate in which building
exactly you worked in?
A. I worked in building house number 3, Building C.
Q. Thank you.  In which building that you said Pao hanged himself
to death?
A. Not Pao.  Actually, Yeun hanged himself to death in Building
D.
Q. In this same photo, can you also remember -- because there is
an entrance which is in the shape of "T" letter, so can you tell
us in which location the medics could stay, because there was a
red-tile roof building so can you please indicate or point to any
particular house the medics would have been working in?
If you look at this red-tiled roof house it is located almost
right opposite the entrance.  So could you please indicate that
building which is right in front of this red-tiled roof building?
A. I don't think I understand much of this photo.
Q. If you look at this building, the red roof building, there is
an entry.  Could you please tell us where would have been the
house, the medics -- the child medics stayed in?
A. I think it would have been this house which is right in front
of the entry because there were some (recording malfunction).
Q. You said that you noted the ambulance, the white ambulance,
which was parked at that time whether it was to collect blood or
not.  So could you please tell the Court whether you could
remember any sign from that ambulance to identify it belonged to
S-21 or other hospital in Phnom Penh back then?
A. I saw a white van, but I don't know whether it was the
ambulance that belonged to S-21 or to other hospital, but there
was an ambulance.
Q. Thank you.  If I show you now the map with street numbers then
could you tell us in which road that you saw such events or such
an incident, and that you stated also that the child medics'
house located on one of the streets, Street 320?
So I would like to give you the photo and could you please
indicate that particular location?
A. I think I don't remember the street numbers because I forget a
lot.  I knew that I lived at the corner of that street near the
compound of S-21, but I maybe not be able to indicate the street
numbers.
MR. TAN SENARONG:
With the President and the Chamber's leave, by the end of my
question, could Mr. Sek Dan be instructed to highlight the
location of the medics' house in which he worked in during that
time, please?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please wait.  Have you received any response already from the
witness in relation to the building one of the staff members of
S-21 hung himself, so that for the good record and transcript
because so far we have not obtained any concrete response yet,
and how can we identify those locations?
And in response to your next question in relation to Building C,
the place where he was assigned to work, I think you should not
even need to ask him to indicate or draw any kind of mark on that
Building C because Building C is quite popular and well known,
and that the witness already indicated that he worked at Building
C.
So what you would like the witness to identify next is to locate
the place where the medics would have been living and that the
building where the staff member hung himself.
Have you received this response yet?
MR. TAN SENARONG:
Thank you, Mr. President.
I would like Mr. Sek Dan to locate the location where he would be
distributing medicines to detainees, and his response is already
clear and recorded but we would like the witness to also
identify, or to confirm whether this is actually the building he
once worked in.
And for the good record, historical record for the new
generation, it is of course for our purpose to ask him to locate
this building because people would later on know that this
Building C would have been the place where he worked to
distribute the medicine.  And that of course Building D was the
location in which the chief of the medics hung himself.
MR. SEK DAN:
Well, I would like to clarify a little bit that he hung himself
not right inside the building but at the outside of the compound
in one of the houses.  I don't remember those houses.
BY MR. TAN SENARONG:
Q. Can you please confirm in which buildings here, which houses
as you can see in this photo, that --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Co-Prosecutor, could you please produce another hard copy of
the photo because even the Chamber itself finds it difficult to
follow you, let alone the public or the witness.
BY MR. TAN SENARONG:
Q. When you indicate, can you mark it on the sketch and you can
write which building -- A, B or C, for instance -- and please
also make your speech to the Chamber once you've marked it on the
sketch.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The counsel for the witness, you may proceed.
MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Because the witness cannot understand
the sketch is it possible for the national Co-Prosecutor to have
other alternative photos to show to the witness in order to make
him understand better -- that is, the location as specified in
the photo -- or maybe the Co-Prosecutor can come close to the
witness to show him?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The national Co-Prosecutor, can you make clearer questions to the
witness and please also bear in mind the limited knowledge of the
witness and try to simplify your question so that with his
limited knowledge he can understand and inform the Chamber of
what he knows.  If your question is beyond his knowledge it is a
waste of time.
MR. TAN SENARONG:
We, the Co-Prosecutors, understand that.  With the President's
leave, if I can go and show the witness the location then I will
try to do so and explain to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can do it, but bear in mind that now you have five more
minutes in excess of your time allocation already.  Please be
specific and try only to pinpoint the actual content of what you
want to ask.
The Co-Prosecutor, you cannot discuss in private with the
witness.  You have to indicate and explain to the witness in
public so that the Chamber and the audience can understand what
you are trying to communicate to the witness.  Otherwise it might
be mistaken that you tried to lead the question into the point
that you want to get from your question.
MR. TAN SENARONG:
Thank you for your instruction, Mr. President.
BY MR. TAN SENARONG:
Q. Mr. Sek Dan, this is a sketch of the Tuol Sleng compound with
the buildings A, B, C, and D, and you said this is the location
where you went around dispensing the medicines.  That's the third
building; right?  Can you indicate the location of the medical
office?
A. It is over there.
Q. Please can you indicate it on the sketch?  You can either
circle it in order to show the location.  So that is the entrance
to the Tuol Sleng compound; right?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The defence counsel, you may proceed.
MR. ROUX:
It's a bit too late, Mr. President.  I just wanted to also have
Mr. Kar Savuth sitting next to the witness at the same time as
the Co-Prosecutor, since I do not understand Khmer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
First, the time allocated for the national Co-Prosecutor runs
out.  So secondly, the Chamber will take into consideration in
order to clarify the matter for the public to understand the
questions posed by any party, rather than it's a subjective
question and only the person who asks the questions can
understand the response.  So if the Chamber understands the
discussion or the explanation is to seek the truth, then it is
allowed.
Now it is time for a break.  The Chamber will take a 20-minute
break until five to 11, when we will resume and we will continue
to hear the testimony of this witness.
Court officer, can you provide necessary refreshments to this
witness and bring him back into the courtroom before the said
time.  The hearing is adjourned.
(Judges exit courtroom)
(Court recesses from 1036H to 1103H)
(Judges enter courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated.  The Court is now in session.
We continue hearing the testimony of Sek Dan, and it is now time
for the civil party lawyers to put questions to the witness.
The Chamber would like to know also how time is allocated among
the civil party lawyer groups.
MS. MOCH SOVANNARY:
Mr. President, Your Honours, we have already discussed and
reached an agreement, so my group, group 3, will use the entire
time allotted to put questions to this witness.
First, I would like to put questions, and my colleague would
follow with some remaining questions.
QUESTIONING BY CIVIL PARTY COUNSEL
BY MS. MOCH SOVANNARY:
Q. Good morning, Mr. Witness, I am Moch Sovannary.  I am here
representing civil party group 3.  I have a couple of questions
to be put to you and if you feel you are not certain whether you
understand my questions, please ask me to repeat them.  And I
would like to thank you in advance for responding to my
questions.
My question is, at one point-in-time, you were taken from your
home town to work and you stated in response to Judge Lavergne
that you were taken by the militia and that you assigned the task
afterwards.  Can you please tell the Court how you were taken
from the home town and were you given any moment to say farewell
to your family?
Do you understand my question?
A. I would like you to clarify it a little bit further.
Q. I would like you to just tell the Court how you were taken
from your home town and in which location were you at when you
were being taken from, and were you given an opportunity to say
goodbye to your parents?
A. I did not have any opportunity to say goodbye, I was just
taken away immediately.
Q. Thank you for your information.
Next, I would like to proceed with the next question in relation
to the arrest of your chief of the group named Pao.  Can you tell
us where was he detained?  Was he detained at Prey Sar or S-21,
or what happened to him?
A. He was arrested and detained at the prison, but I did not see
in which room he was detained because normally people who stayed
together when they were arrested we would not be allowed to see
where they would have been detained.
Q. Thank you.  So how did you know that the person was detained
at S-21?
A. When the person disappeared, and especially those who worked
in the compound would have been detained inside the prison, not
elsewhere.
Q. Next, you said that you observed that the injuries or wounds
on some detainees, and that in your interview to the
Co-Investigating Judges you indicated that you saw the injuries,
the nails missing, and others.
In the record of the interview, you also stated that some
detainees got their head split open -- or the wounds in the head,
so can you tell the Court how severe were the wounds sustained on
the heads of some detainees and how could detainees get such
wounds?
A. Could you please clarify your question?
Q. Actually, before the Co-Investigating Judges you said you saw
detainees with wounds and who were bleeding and their heads were
injured.  Could you tell us how these detainees get such
injuries?  Do you understand my question?
A. I'm afraid I will not respond to this question.
Q. I would like to proceed with the last question before I will
give the floor to my colleague to proceed with further questions.
In document D28/19 on page with ERN 00163851, you said you saw
the accused inside the political school; you saw him twice.  Do
you remember having said that?  If so, do say so in the Court.
If not, do also say you don't remember.
A. I saw him twice, but I don't really remember it.
Q. So you said you saw him twice but you are not sure where you
saw him.  Is that correct?
A. It is correct.
MS. MOCH SOVANNARY:
I have no further questions.  I would like my colleague to
proceed with the rest of the questions.
BY MS. TRUSSES-NAPROUS:
Q. Hello, Mr. Sek Dan.  I am Ms. Fabienne Trusses-Naprous.  I am
co-lawyer for civil party group number 3 and I would like to
thank you for your presence here.
You are now 48 years old.  Please tell us how you feel now, with
regard to your experience between 1975 and 1979; how do you feel
about that time of your life?  How do you see it from your
perspective today?
A. I thought back then that everyone would have been killed
except those people who worked at my location.
Q. I understand what you are saying but my question was, how do
you see things today as an adult now?  How do you feel about that
particular time of your life?
A. I don't think I understand the question very well.
Q. Do you still suffer from what you saw during that time?  Do
you have problems with regard to what you saw at the time?  Do
you have anxiety; do you have sleep loss?  Does it worry you?
A. Well, back then, I was so worried that one day I too would be
taken away to be killed because I wouldn't make any mistakes, for
example.
Q. I'd just like to return to a question that lawyer Moch
Sovannary put to you.  She talked about you meeting Duch on two
occasions.  Do you remember what he said when you met him on
those two occasions?
A. He lectured in the political sessions and I don't know much of
the lectures he was giving at that time.
MS. TRUSSES-NAPROUS:
I have no further questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Civil party lawyers, you still have 10 more minutes.  We don't
know whether you would like to proceed with other questions.  I
don't know whether other lawyers of the group would like to put
some questions to the witness.
Otherwise, the Chamber would like to now give the floor to the
defence counsel to put questions to the witness.
MR. KAR SAVUTH:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours, and the Chamber.
QUESTIONING BY DEFENCE COUNSEL
BY MR. KAR SAVUTH:
Q. Mr. Sek Dan, you said you were the child medic at S-21.  You
saw the ambulance with the hospital sign before the S-21
compound.
Do you remember what colour was the car?
A. It was a white car with a hospital symbol.
Q. Did you know that the car belonged to S-21 or did it belong to
other units instead?
A. I would not like to respond to this question.
Q. Two.  You said the medic house stored prahok underneath the
house.  Were you suspicious why the prahok was stored under the
medics' house, not at the kitchen?
A. I was suspicious why this kind of fermented fish, or prahok,
stored at that medic house other than the kitchen.
Q. Thank you.  Actually was the fermented fish just brought in
recently?
A. It was only brought in recently.
Q. Thank you.  When you distributed medicines to the detainees
did you ever see Duch use any tortures against any detainees?
A. I never saw him directly but he ordered such tortures because,
for example, he could have ordered Peng and other people to use
tortures.
Q. So you did not see him use torture directly and that you heard
of tortures used by Duch through other people.  Is that correct?
A. I would not want to respond to that question.
Q. You said the chief of the medics, the adult chief of medics,
were arrested and that only Duch who made such order of the
arrests.  What kind of evidence could you obtain to prove that
you knew that Duch ordered such arrests?
A. It is obvious that he was the chief of that location.
Q. So having earning the title as the chairperson then you can
presume that he could have ordered such arrests?  Is that
correct?
A. That's what I concluded because he was the chief, so no-one
else could carry out any order.
Q. So were you suspicious that other people on top of him would
have ordered such arrests?
A. I have no idea because I only learned that it was Duch who
made such orders.
MR. KAR SAVUTH:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to share the floor with
my co-colleague.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. François Roux, you take the floor.
MR. ROUX:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROUX:
Q. Thank you, witness.  I'd like to put a number of questions to
you so that you can help us shed light on a number of points.
In your statement made before the investigators of the
Co-Investigating Judges it is indicated that you were born in
1961 in Trapeang Krabau village.  Is that correct?
A. It's correct that I was born in Trapeang Krabau, Tuek Phos,
Kampong Chhnang.
Q. And you were born in 1961.  Is that correct?
A. It's correct.
Q. Mr. Sek Dan, if you were born in 1961, in 1975 you would not
be 11 years old as you have told this Court; you would be 14
years old instead.  Is that correct?
A. I'm not good at calculating it so I may not respond.
Q. In my country we say that the figures speak for themselves.
So if you do confirm that you were born in 1961, you would then
be
years old in 1975. 
          14   You said that in 1975 you were first designated to come to Phnom
Penh and that you went to the military school and that you spent
three months there.  Is that correct?
A. Yes, it's correct.
Q. And then you said to the investigators of the Co-Investigating
Judges that you went to farm rice and build dykes like the other
inhabitants.  Do you remember for how long you went to cultivate
rice and build the dyke after the three months you mentioned?
A. I don't remember how many months, although I worked at the
rice fields at different places.
Q. Can we work in stages?  Did you spend one year, say, working
in the rice farm?  Did you spend one entire season at the rice
farm or did you spend less than one season there?
A. I worked there for one season after another.
Q. So it can be said that you worked there for two seasons; would
that be correct?
A. I don't respond to this question.
Q. Witness, I recall that you may refuse to answer questions that
incriminate you but not other questions.  So I shall try to help
you.  If you stayed in the rice field for two rice seasons would
you agree with me if I were to say that you stayed at the rice
field for about a year?
A. I don't understand your question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The counsel for the witness, you can take the floor but before
giving the floor to the counsel I would like to -- we would like
to inform the witness that you can decline to respond to any
questions that you believe could self-incriminate you, for
example like have you ever killed anyone and this kind of
response, if you said yes, then it would implicate or would
incriminate you.
But here you are obliged to tell the truth, nothing but the
truth, something you witnessed, you still remember and you have
to tell the Court that you don't remember or you remember or not.
And you cannot just not to respond to the questions that are not
self-incriminating you.  Do you understand this?
WITNESS:
I don't quite understand that much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The counsel for the witness, could you please explain to the
witness in relation to his testimony?
MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Thank you, Mr. President.
I will need some time to talk with the witness.  I would like to
make small remark in relation to the memory of the witness.  The
witness has poor memory so may I suggest that people who put
questions shorten their questions so that the questions are
brief, precise, and that the witness find it easy to respond.
Otherwise, he will not respond to such questions.
So when he does not respond to question it appears that he
doesn't understand the question instead rather he did not want to
respond.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The President allows the counsel to consult the witness.
(Witness consults with counsel)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The defence counsel, Mr. Roux, you can continue your questioning
to the witness.
MR. ROUX:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROUX:
Q. So Mr. Dan, I'm just trying with your help, to understand the
chronology, the dates that you provided to us in your statement
and do you remember the statement that you provided to the
investigators of the Co-Investigating Judges, do you remember
that statement, Mr. Dan, Sek Dan?
A. I don't really recall it well.
Q. Okay.  Because in this statement you provided rather specific
dates, so I just want to check with you today to make sure if we
are right in considering these dates or if on the contrary you
are telling us that the dates that you provided to us do not
really correspond to reality.  This is what I want to check with
you.
Well, let me start again.  You therefore said that, after the
17th of April 1975 you came to Phnom Penh and that you spent
three months in the military school, and you also then said that
you went to harvest rice for two seasons.  Is that indeed what
you said?
A. That is correct.  That was my statement.
Q. And if we try to reconstruct the chronology of the different
events, this would therefore mean that you arrived in April 1975,
then you spent three months in a military school.  That is to say
May, June, and July of 1975.  Is that so?  And then two seasons,
that represents a little bit more than a year, so this would mean
that you arrived at S-21 in the middle of 1976, on the basis of
this calculation.  Does it therefore seem to you plausible that
you arrived at S-21 in the middle of 1976, as far as you can
recall?
A. It was 1978.  It was in early 1978.
Q. Indeed that's what you said to the investigators.  You said
indeed that you arrived in 1978.  But here, Mr. Sek Dan, if you
arrived in 1978 at S-21 you were not
years old; you were 17 
 
         11   years old.
It was just something that I was stating.  You are not obliged,
of course, to answer but it's very easy to calculate.  If you
were born in 1961 and if you arrived at S-21 in 1978 you were not
11 years old.
And do you know in what year Pao was killed?  Do you know in
which year Pao was killed?  You told us that the unit was led by
Pao and do you know in which year he was killed?
A. It was in the early of the year that I went to work at S-21
but I cannot recall the exact date when he was killed.
Q. In any case, as far as you can recall, when you arrived in the
medical unit Pao was still the head of the medical unit.  Is that
so?
A. That is correct.  He was the chief of the group and he was in
charge of the child medics.
Q. And you also spoke about Yeun and his former deputy who
followed up on him, and you said that Yeun hung himself.  So
therefore who took up after Yeun?
A. That was the time that we fled already.  So at that time,
because of the situation, nobody was yet appointed to replace
him.
Q. So you want to tell us that Yeun hung himself just before
January 1979 when the Vietnamese arrived?
A. That is correct.
Q. And above your leaders who was your direct superior -- above
your leaders?
A. There was nobody else in my group; that is, the medical group.
I only had a chief of the group.  At my location there was no
platoon or company.  The top one was the chief of the group.
Probably there would be companies or platoons in various other
units.
Q. And if I say the name Peng does that mean anything to you?
Does that ring a bell with you?
A. I heard the name Peng and I used to see him but Peng was not
in my unit.
Q. And who was he?  He was not part of your group, okay, but what
was his function?  Do you know what Peng was doing?
A. He was in a company in another unit.  He was in the guards
unit whose duty was to guard the prisoners.
[11.44.30
Q. Fine.  And have you ever heard about Hor?
A. I saw Ta Hor.  He had a crooked mouth.
Q. Fine.  But then what was Hor's position?  What was his role?
A. I did not know his position or his role.  I only saw him there
but I think he must had one of the senior roles working together
with Duch.
Q. You remember that when Judge Thou Mony questioned you to ask
you if you knew the other senior people, you said no.  So
therefore you do know in fact the other senior people.  So I'm
going to continue trying to refresh your memory.  If I speak to
you about Try, does that ring a bell?
A. I used to see Try I think for one or two months when I
arrived.  He was also in the medical unit with Pao.  That's all I
know about Try but I think he's already dead.
Q. So you saw him for only one or two months at the beginning of
1978.  Is that so?
A. That is correct.  What I have said is correct.
Q. I would like to tell you that some of the witnesses who spoke
before the Chamber specified that Try was there at S-21 until the
end, the very end, and that he fled at the same time as everyone
else.  But, however, you did not see him; that's what you're
saying?
A. At that time he was arrested, so I presumed he was dead.
Q. Can you tell us with whom you fled?  Who was with you when you
fled from S-21 in January 1979?
A. At that time all of us fled all together.  I fled with those
child medics who came from my village, so there were three of us
fleeing together.  First we fled together but after we were fired
upon we split and there were only three of us together, so I was
not with the main group any more.  There were only us, the three
of us, and the other two children they were a bit older and had
bigger build than me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The defence counsel, please be reminded that your time has
elapsed.
MR. ROUX:
Mr. President, I would like you to take into account the time
that the counsel spent with his witness, which should not be
included, so therefore I would like to be able to finish
questioning the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you think you actually need?  And the Chamber
will make a decision accordingly.  You are reminded that the
Chamber has already allocated the time for each party and
actually the Chamber has granted you seven extra minutes on top
of the time allocated to you, and then we will still need time
for the accused to make his observations to this witness
testimony, and also time is allocated for the witness to respond
to the observation by the accused if he has any.  And this
morning actually the accused made a preliminary observation
already.
MR. ROUX:
I need three minutes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are granted three additional minutes.
MR. ROUX:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROUX:
Q. Mr. Dan, can you just simply tell us with which senior leaders
you fled on the 7th of January 1979?  Who were the leaders who
were with you when you were fleeing?
A. There were many people, so I did not know whether any leaders
were fleeing at the same time with us, and I was scared too at
the time.  So I did not go and look at the buildings where I used
to work.  I was just fleeing, myself, along with a few other
people.  I was only concentrating on fleeing; that's all.
MR. ROUX:
I have no further questions.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber would like now to give opportunity to the accused to
make his observations regarding this witness testimony.
The accused, you are reminded that you can make your observations
within the testimony of this witness and you are not allowed to
make other observations in relation to testimonies of other
witnesses who have already provided their testimonies.
THE ACCUSED:
Mr. President, my observation to the Chamber at this time is that
this witness, Sek Dan, is a son of a peasant from a countryside.
He has limited memory and education and, taking into account all
these factors, it is likely that he was sent to S-21.  However,
the testimony provided by him has contradictory time lines; for
example, Pao.  Pao did not live in 1978.  He died before that.
And the reason is that Comrade Pao, when Hor had diarrhoea, Pao
gave Hor some medication and then Hor got seizures and I reported
this incident to Son Sen, because the medicine had arsenic
substance in it.  And then Son Sen ordered me to arrest Pao and
he was arrested and smashed, and I did not want to talk about the
other chief before Pao but Pao died before that time.
So the contradiction in his testimony leads me to believe that he
doesn't seem to be a staff of S-21, so that is my first
observation.  And for the second observation, it's that he knew
three other people from Kampong Chhnang -- that is, Mon, Thim,
whose names I cannot recall -- and he also talked about Comrade
Yeun who hanged himself to death.  I was the Chairman of S-21.  I
never heard of any S-21 staff who committed suicide by hanging
himself.  And when I was the deputy, yes, one person, one staff
died due to the electrocution and I reported that incident to my
superior.
And regarding the ambulance which arrived at the entrance of the
prison -- and I think that street is 113 -- there would be no
vehicle ever dare to enter the entrance or at the street attached
to the entrance of S-21.  All the vehicles would only stop at
point A, which I marked on a sketch, except the vehicle of Son
Sen which arrived at the entrance where Hor and I waited to greet
him.
That was the only vehicle authorized to enter it.  So all these
points make me believe that he could not grasp the actual
situation of S-21.
So it is my impression that, in general, his testimony is based
on the situation, and when he talks about the general situation
of the prisoners he talks about the rabbit pellet medicines and
about the medicines that that he ate.  So, in general, it seems
that his testimony is acceptable but, based on the points that I
just raised, it made me suspicious of his testimony.  And that is
all.
Judge Lavergne, you may proceed.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
I would just like to know if the accused has any documents which
would allow us to determine the date when Hor would have been the
victim of this reaction to this medicine, and also to establish
the date when Pao would have been executed?
THE ACCUSED:
Your Honour, Pao, who was arrested at S-21, I could not recall it
exactly because I cannot recall his surname.  The documents that
can be found are only his confession.  I think his confession is
still at S-21 and, based on that document, then we can know the
exact date of his arrest, Your Honour.
BY MR. PRESIDENT:
Q. Mr. Sek Dan, do you have any reasons to tell the Chamber that
you are actually a child medic working at S-21, that you
dispensed the medicines, that you cleansed the wounds of the
prisoners at S-21, besides what you have provided in your
testimony to the Chamber this morning?  This is in response to
the observations made by the accused that he doubts that you were
a medical staff at S-21.
A. I really worked there and the people who came with me to work
there could be the proof.
Q. Who were they -- or who are they?
A.  Mean learned already that I was the child medic.
Q. What is that person's full name?
A. I don't remember his full name, but he worked there.
Q. What did Mean  do at S-21?  Please wait until you see the red
light otherwise your response cannot be communicated.  And,
please, for the good record, wait until you see the red light.
You said that you know that Mean could shed some light in
relation to your existence at S-21.  So what did he do at S-21?
A. He was a guard.  He knows me as Dan, the child medic.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Sek Dan, for your attendance before the
ECCC.
We note how very difficult this has been for you because you have
been questioned from several parties to the proceedings, and that
the facts at issue were something more than 30 years ago and
that, at that time, you were very young and your educational
background was very limited too.
This makes your memory is rather poor, and the Chamber noted that
you had been working your best to fulfil your duty as a witness
to shed light in relation to the facts to the Chamber.
The Chamber has no further questions to put to you and you are
now allowed to go back to your residence.  And the Court official
is now instructed to take Mr. Sek Dan to meet with the WESU so
that the unit can take him back to his residence.
(Witness exits courtroom)
The Court finds it now convenient to take an adjournment for
lunch, so we will adjourn and we will resume at 1.30 p.m.
By then, we are going to hear another witness, KW-21.  So please,
the parties to the proceedings and the public, be informed.
The detention facility security personnel are now instructed to
take the accused back to the detention facility.
THE GREFFIER:
All rise.
(Judges exit courtroom)
(Court recesses from 1204H to 1332H)
(Judges enter courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated.  The Court is now in session.  We're going to
hear another witness, Witness KW-21.
We note that Mr. François Roux is on his feet.
MR. ROUX:
Thank you, Mr. President.
Before having the witness come into the courtroom I would like,
on behalf of the defence, to express the strongest reservations
regarding the fact that we do not have any French translation of
this witness's statement which he provided to the investigators
of the Co-Investigating Judges, Index D22/13.
We have the English version and it is a document dated from
October 24th 2007, and a year and a half later we still do not
have a French translation of this document.  I find this
completely abnormal and therefore I am asking the Chamber to
please ask the administration to make sure that such situations
do not happen again.  Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court officer is now instructed to call Witness KW-21 into
the courtroom.
(Witness enters courtroom)
QUESTIONING BY THE BENCH
BY MR. PRESIDENT:
Q. Mr. Witness, what is your name?
A. I'm Lach Mean.
Q. Do you use other names?
A. No, I don't.
Q. How old are you this year?
A. I'm 52 years old.
Q. What do you do for a living?
A. I am a farmer.
Q. According to the reports of the Greffiers, as of this morning
it indicates that you have no blood relation with any parties to
the proceedings and that you have already taken an oath.  Is that
correct?
A. Yes, it is, Your Honour
Q. The witness, could you please be reminded that before you
could respond to any questions of mine and other parties to the
proceedings, could you please wait until you see the red light is
on before you speak, in order for the transcribers and for the
other parties to hear your words in the translated or interpreted
language.  Do you understand this?
A. Yes, I do.  I'm sorry, I was about to make another mistake.
Q. Now, we would like to inform you of the rights and obligation
as a witness.  As a witness you may decline to answer any
questions that you are afraid that your testimony could
self-incriminate you.  So you have the right not to incriminate
yourself and as a witness you shall only tell the Court the
truth, nothing but the truth, and you are not allowed to make
your assumption in this Court.  Do you understand?
A. Yes, I do, Your Honour.
Q. Mr. Lach Mean, can you please briefly tell us your life story,
starting from 1970 to the 17th of April 1975; where did you live,
what did you do?  Once again, please be reminded that the Court
is now interested to hear first the activities of yours from 1970
to 1975.
A. From 1970 to 1975; first, in 1970 I lived and worked with my
parents and later on I was ordained as a monk and in 1972 or 1973
I was still a monk and later on I was assigned to stand by to
carry the wounded at the commune and then I was recruited as the
commune militia.
In 1974 and late 1974 I worked at the local military unit, worked
as the combatant and I had worked in this unit until 1975.  Later
on, after 1975, after the war was over I was sent to Boeng Tumpun
to raise pigs and to collect morning glory, and in the same year
I was sent to attend study sessions at the military technical
schools at Ta Khmau School.
After having been tempered for one month or two months I was then
sent to live and work at Ta Khmau in a unit, I don't remember the
name of that unit; I was assigned to gather detainees and also
was asked to pour water or to water the plants, vegetables.
I worked there briefly, about a few months and then I was
assigned to work at the location near Central Market, called PJ.
At this PJ prison I worked for almost one year, probably, or
maybe more than one year, I don't remember quite well.
At that time I was asked to guard detainees who were put in each
house or rooms and maybe early 1976 or seven or eight -- I'm
sorry, I don't remember this quite well -- the location of that
prison was relocated to S-21 which is the Tuol Sleng Prison.
So this is my brief life history from 1970 to 1975, and I left
Phnom Penh in 1979 of course.
Q. You indicated that from 1970 to 1973 you lived with your
parents and you were ordained as a monk in Thlok Vien location,
so in which province was Thlok Vien located?
A. I was a monk in Thlok Vien Commune.  It was called Kampong
Tralach Leu District, now it is named Sameakki Meanchey District,
Kampong Chhnang Province.
Q. You say that after you left the monkhood you were made to
carry the wounded in the battlefields and also to help transport
food and supplies and later on you worked as the local military.
So in which district did you work in at that time?
A. The military unit at that time was called just District
Military Unit, I don't remember the name exactly.
Q. Was it in Kampong Tralach District or in, Sameakki Meanchey,
as what you said?
A.  At that time it was the Kampong Tralach Leu or Dâb Pi
District.
Q. Can you also please tell the Court about the duties you were
assigned with at the prison you claimed you worked in at Ta
Khmau?  Can you also tell the Court about the condition or the --
especially how detainees were treated?
A. At that time, the detainees detained at Ta Khmau prison, to my
observation, they were the detainees who had already been
interrogated and who were put to work to water vegetables or to
work with the woodworks.
Q. Back then, do you still remember what kind of detainees were
there?  Were they the former soldiers of Lon Nol's regime or were
they the cadres of the revolutionary, or were they officials from
the former regime?
A. I don't know for sure what kind of detainees were they because
it was not part of my business to know what kind of detainees
they were.  I was asked to only guard them and make sure that I
did not allow any detainee to escape.  That was my primary task
already.
Q. You said you were guarding the detainees who were made to
water vegetables.  In which location were you working; was it a
school compound or was it a new prison compound?
A. At that location, it was the psychiatric hospital left -- the
remnant from the former regime.
Q. How many detainees were put in that psychiatric hospital that
turned prison, especially during the time when you had been
working there?
A. There were about 100, more or less; about 100 detainees.
Q. Before you left that prison, the Ta Khmau prison, so there
were about 100 detainees as you indicated.  So before you left
the location, did you know where these detainees were taken to or
what happened to them?
A. I did not know because I was sent straight to work at the PJ
prison and I did not know where those people would have been
taken to.
Q. You indicated briefly about your work.  You were assigned to
work at the PJ prison and you also witnessed the condition of the
detainees detained there.  Could you please tell the Court, to
the best of your recollection, about the condition of detainees
at the PJ prison?
A. At the PJ prison, I was guarding the detainees in each room.
Detainees would be shackled by their legs and I was asked to only
guard them.
Q. At the PJ prison -- and that you claimed that you were
assigned to guard the detainees -- can you give us the
approximate number of the detainees who had been detained back
then in those rooms?
A. There were about 10 or more people in that house.  I was on
guard.  I don't know how many other prisoners would be detained
in other houses.
Q. Do you also remember back then the name of the location at the
outset?  You called it the PJ prison, but back then what was it
named?
A. I read the letter in Khmer, which was the police headquarters
or department.
Q. Had you ever learned of the Dam Pheng prison?
A. I had heard of it.  That prison was named Dam Pheng prison.
Q. So when the person referred to that location as Dam Pheng
prison, it was the PJ prison.  Is that correct?
A. Yes, it is correct, Your Honour.
Q. Who was the chairman of the prison when you first came to work
at that location, or do you still remember the superiors and
other subordinates at that time?
A. I know the superiors including Duch, Hor and Pauch, who was
the chief of my unit, the defence unit.
Q. Do you ever know the person named In Lorn, alias Nat?
A. I had not learned or heard of that person's name, so I'm not
quite sure that I know this person, so I may say that I don't
know.
Q. At that location, had you learned of any detainees being
tortured while you were being on guard?
A. Normally, interrogation sessions would be done in a separate
location that the guards could never know what would happen
during the sessions.
Q. What about the people at that location?  Did you also observe
that detainees would gradually disappear?
A. There was no-one disappeared at the location where I was on
guard.
Q. You stated that you are not sure you remember the exact date
when that prison, the PJ prison, was transferred or relocated to
the current location.
So can you tell the Court whether, at the beginning when this
location was relocated to the new location, it was the Tuol Sleng
Prison or was it moved to another location before it was later on
located to S-21?  Could you please shed more light on this?
A. I think the new location was this S-21 location after it had
been relocated from PJ prison.
Q. At that time what was the actual official name of that office
during the time when you worked at that prison; the new prison
after the PJ?  Now everyone knows that it is the genocidal museum
of Tuol Sleng but at that time I don't know whether you remember
there was any new name for that location officially.
A. It was named the S-21 Office, no other names.
Q. Please be reminded that the S-21 museum is just the new name,
because they want to maintain the name of S-21 for the good
record, good historical record.  The name "museum" only was taken
or was used recently.  Could you please tell us again whether
back then the name of the office -- what was the name of the
office?
A. It was, Your Honour, the Office of S-21.
Q. What kind of work were you assigned to do when you first came
to work at S-21?
A. I was asked to guard the cells, the buildings, and we took
turn to guard the detainees.  So there were groups of guards and
then there were shifts, and later on I was assigned to work with
a typewriter to record documents.  And then I was asked to learn
how to interrogate detainees in late 1978.  After three months of
such training then the Vietnamese approached Cambodia.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judges of the Bench, do you have questions for this witness?
Judge Ya Sokhan, you may proceed with your questions.
JUDGE YA SOKHAN:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY JUDGE YA SOKHAN:
Q. When you were transferred to S-21 did you know who was the
Chairman and who was in the committee of S-21?
A. I was transferred to S-21.  Regarding the committee, I knew
Duch and Hor, and Hor was the chief of my guard unit.
Q. Did you know Nun Huy, alias Huy Sre?
A. I knew Huy Sre.  He occasionally came to S-21.  He was in
charge of the unit at Prey Sar at the rice fields.
Q. Was Huy Sre also a member of the committee of S-21?
A. From what I knew, Huy was a member of the S-21 committee.
Q. Did you know at S-21 how many units there were and what are
they?
A. I do not know.  In S-21 there was a rice field section besides
the S-21 compound itself.
Q. You were assigned to work at S-21.  Which unit did you belong
to and who was your unit chief?
A. My unit chief while I was at the guard unit was Seng.
Q. In your guard unit, how many members?
A. The chief of the guard unit was Seng.  I worked under him and
later on I was transferred to the interrogation unit and I worked
under the supervision of Kak, who taught me how to interrogate.
Q. Can you recall the names of those people who worked in the
guard unit?
A. While I was in the guard unit I cannot recall the names of
people who worked there.  I can recall a few names including Yem
Yean, alias Chrech; Rei, Pheap, Ches, Soeur; that's all.
Q. You worked as a guard.  Were you assigned to stand guard
outside or inside the compound of S-21?
A. I was assigned to guard the cells and the rooms, sometimes on
the first or the second floor of the middle building or the
building to the north.  I was guarding those common rooms.
Q. So you were the inside guard.  Is that correct?
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. So you were assigned to work as a guard.  Were you taught how
to guard and, if so, who taught you?
A. At that time Seng was the unit chief.  He taught me how to
guard and not to allow the prisoners to escape or to commit
suicide.
Q. Did you know, at S-21, how many buildings there were?
A. There were three large buildings and each building had three
floors, and there was a front office.
Q. Can you recall exactly which building were you assigned to
guard and on which floor?
A. Yes, I remember.  I was assigned to guard the middle building
on the first and second floor.  Also, I was assigned to guard the
north building, the second floor of that north building, and
there were common rooms in that building.
Q. At night, where did you stay?
A. At night, I stayed at a house outside the compound.
Q. Where did you have your meals?
A. We had our meals outside the compound at the economic section.
Q. Was it a common dining hall or was it only specially made for
the staff of S-21?
A. We had our meals at our own separate unit.  For example, the
guard unit would have our meals within our guard unit.
Q. Did you ever see the accused having meals at that location?
A. Are you referring to the accused in this Chamber?
Q. Did Duch ever have meals at that location at the time?
A. At that time, yes, he had his meals with the interrogation
unit.  Occasionally, I saw him having meals there.
Q. So he did not have meals together with the guard unit?
A. He did not join the guard unit for lunch or for meals.
Q. You were assigned to guard inside.  What was the working
hours?
A. It started from 5 p.m.  I apologize, it started from 6 p.m.
until 12 midnight and then there was another shift.
Q. During the working hours, were you allowed to carry any weapon
and, if so, what weapon?
A. At that time, we were not allowed to carry any weapon.  We
patrolled on foot and we were not allowed to rest, so we
patrolled constantly up and down the building.
Q. During the time that you guarded inside, did you ever see
prisoners being taken to be detained in the building?
A. Yes, I saw prisoners being taken to be detained in the room
while I was guarding.
Q. Were the prisoners walked, and did they do anything to the
prisoners?  Or if the prisoners were blindfolded or cuffed, and
what clothes were the prisoners wearing?
A. At that time, the prisoners were walked, they were handcuffed,
they wore shorts and they were blindfolded.  So once they were
put inside the rooms then they removed the blindfold.
Q. Did you really take the prisoners inside the room or it was
done by another group?
A. Another group took the prisoners to be put inside the room.  I
was only standing guard.
Q. Did you ever see female prisoners or children walked and
detained?
A. Yes, there were female prisoners, but I did not see any
children.
Q. The female prisoners who were walked, were they also
blindfolded and handcuffed like the male prisoners?
A. I did not see female prisoners being walked.  I only saw them
detained at the front office.  I did not see them being walked
into another room.
Q. The children who were walked to be detained in the rooms, was
it done on a daily basis?
A. Not on a daily basis; it was irregular.  Sometimes it happened
on a daily basis, sometimes it happened every week or fortnight.
That's based on my observation while I was standing guard.
Q. Did you ever see prisoners being walked in large groups to be
detained?
A. At that time, yes.  People in large group were put in the
four-by-four truck and they were disembarked and they were walked
and detained in a large room.
Q. While you worked as a guard inside, did you ever see prisoners
being taken out?
A. The prisoners who were taken out, they were put into a truck.
They were brought out from the common rooms and they were put
into a large, covered truck and taken away.  That's what I saw.
Q. Based on your estimation, during the time that you worked as a
guard inside, how many trucks, from your own witness -- how many
trucks of the prisoners were taken out?
A. I cannot recall.
Q. Can you make a rough estimate?
A. I cannot provide any estimate because once in a while I saw
what happened, and if it happened during the night then I could
not say, and sometimes I did not see when the prisoners were
taken out.  So it is difficult for me to provide any rough
estimate.
Q. You said your unit chief was Seng.  Is this correct?
A. Yes, Seng was my unit chief.
Q. During the time you worked as a guard inside, were you ever
assigned to make arrest of people outside at various departments
or offices or at the various zones?
A. No, I was not.  I was not allowed to go outside.
Q. Did you know which group was assigned to make outside arrests
and brought the prisoners into S-21?
A. Regarding the arrest outside I had no knowledge of this.  I
heard it was the duty of the messengers group, but I did not know
anything about this group.
Q. Did you ever see any foreigners arrested and brought to S-21?
A. At that time, I saw two or three foreigners being brought.
They were being brought to be interrogated and I think there were
two or three of them.
Q. Did you see any Vietnamese prisoners of war being arrested and
detained at S-21, or any Vietnamese civilians?
A. For Vietnamese people, yes, I saw them in large number; there
were truckloads of them.  That was towards the end of 1978.
There were two or three truckloads of them.
Q. Can you recall from your estimate, how many people all
together?
A. I can provide any appropriate any estimate; it's roughly 100
or 100 plus or up to 200 or even more but I cannot say for sure,
but I saw them in large numbers.
Q. For the female prisoners, were there many of them and what
about the children?
A.  For the female prisoners where I was working as a guard,
there were only a few of them, probably four or five or 10.  So I
would say less than 10 when I saw it, but I didn't know later on
whether the number increased or decreased.
Q. Did you know if any S-21 staff were arrested?
A. For the S-21 staff, some of them disappeared on a continuous
basis, but I didn't know whether they were arrested or not but I
believe -- and it is my conclusion -- that those people who
disappeared were arrested.
Q. Did you think those people, the S-21 staff, were arrested and
they were covered so that the other staff would not see them or
identify them?
A. I did not see this personally, however, it is my conclusion
that for the staff who were arrested they would be covered, so
that the other staff would not identify them.  That's why they
were covered with blankets.
Q. Did you see them covered with blankets?
A. Yes, I saw them being walked while covered with blankets, and
staff disappeared.  For example, if a person disappeared then
next day or so then I saw a person being walked, covered with
blanket.
Q. In your group anybody was arrested?
A. My group chief disappeared and some other people also
disappeared constantly.
Q. What were their names?
A. The chief of the interrogation unit, Kak disappeared, Heng,
Norn also disappeared.
Q. Did you know who issued the orders for their arrest?
A. Regarding the order, I would not know.
Q. Did you know the name Peng?
A. No, I do not know this name.
Q. Did you know that Nun Huy was arrested?
A. No, I did not know about his arrest.
Q. Were there any arrest of the Prey Sar staff and sent to S-21?
A. For the staff at Prey Sar, I did not know if any of them was
arrested or not.
Q. You worked as a guard inside.  When people were brought to be
detained, were they put into separate categories?  For example,
important buildings (sic) will be detained in a particular
building and less important prisoners will be detained in another
separate building?
A. For important prisoners, I didn't know where they would be
detained but, in the individual's cells, prisoners were detained
there and the interrogation unit would take them from those cells
to be interrogated.
Q. Were you ever assigned to guard in the common room?
A. Yes, I used to guard in the common room, in the north building
on the second floor.
Q. For the common rooms, what types of prisoners were detained?
A. For the common rooms, prisoners will be detained and shackled
in a long row of metal bar, sometimes both of the ankles were
shackled, sometimes only one ankle was shackled.
Q. For one row, how many prisoners were put and shackled?
A. For one row, I think the metal bar was a pretty long, probably
five metres long, so there could be between 15 to 20 prisoners in
each row.
Q. Were they shackled or were they handcuffed?
A. Their ankles were shackled to the metal bar.
Q. You mean both ankles or just one ankle?
A. As I said, sometimes both ankles were shackled, sometimes only
one, depending on the number of the prisoners.  If there were
more, then only one ankle would be shackled.
Q. What clothes did the prisoners wear?
A. In the common room, they wore shorts and they had
short-sleeved shirts.
Q. Did they all have shirts?
A. Yes, all of them in the common room.
Q. Were those prisoners allowed only to lie down or they could
sit up or stand?
A. They were allowed to lie down or sit up.  If they wanted to
stand, they were allowed to stand only for a short time and they
had to sit up or lie down.
Q. Did they have to seek permission from the guard if they wanted
to sit up or stand?
A. To sit up, they did not need to ask permission from the guard,
but if they wanted to stand they had to ask permission from the
guard.
Q. In the common rooms, were any female prisoners and children
detained?
A. There were no female prisoners or children detained in the
common rooms.  Only male prisoners were detained.
Q. Were you ever assigned to guard the rooms where female
prisoners were detained?
A. For the female prisoners, I was never assigned to guard any
room where the female prisoners were detained.  I only saw them
while I walked across or past them.
Q. What about the foreigners or westerners, where were they
detained?
A. I saw them being walked to the south building.
Q. Did you see those westerners or foreigners being detained?
A. I did not see them being detained.
Q. What about the Vietnamese prisoners of war, which building
were they detained in?
A. Most of them were detained in the north building in the common
rooms.
Q. Were they stripped of the clothes and only shorts were allowed
to wear?
A. Most of them wore shorts and majority of them were topless.
Q. What about the S-21 staff who were arrested, where were they
detained?
A. For the S-21 staff, they were also detained in the south
building.
Q. Did you guard at that location?
A. No, I didn't.  I did not even go into the south building.
Q. How did you know that staff members who were detainees were
detained there?
A. At that time, I saw them being walked while they're covered
with blankets into that south building.
Q. Was food given -- or what was the food ration?  How many meals
a day was each detainee given?
A. There were rice with soup, the soup mixed with fermented fish.
I don't remember in details, but normally it was a kind of common
soup to be mixed with rice.
Q. Were you on guard outside the detainees' room or cells?
A. I did not guard outside but I worked inside the rooms.  I
worked from one room to another.
Q. So when detainees were offered the rice, did you witness it?
A. Yes, I saw it.  I saw that the rice and soup were mixed
already and the person would be carrying that meal and that the
detainees would be given a bowl of that rice with soup.
Q. Was it rice or gruel?
A. At that time, it was thick gruel but, later on, I have no idea
what would be in the meal; maybe some rice or maybe some soup.
Q. So how many meals a day would any detainee be offered, and how
much?  I mean, the quantity of the meal.
A. Each was given a bowl or a mug.
Q. Was it a military kind of mug used back then?
A. It was more like a water bowl with handles, so the food would
be put inside that bowl.
Q. So can you estimate to what extent could that bowl be filled
with rice or gruel?
A. For people who ate less it would be enough for a meal, but
people who ate more it would not be sufficient for a meal.
Q. How many times were detainees offered meals?
A. Two times; in the morning at 10.30 and in the late afternoon
at about 5 p.m.
Q. How many days or how many times a week was detainee allowed to
have a wash?
A. I never saw any detainee being washed or allowed to have a
wash but, in the common room, detainees would be washed but not
in the individual cells.
Q. How were detainees washed in that room?
A. They would be hosed down from the water hose and, at the same
time, the detainee would be washed while the floor would be
cleaned.
Q. Were detainees allowed to change their clothes when they got
wet or were they not?
A. No, they weren't.  They did not have any clothes to change.
Q. When detainees would like to relieve themselves, how did they
do that?
A. There was an ammunition box given to the detainees in that big
or common room.  There were about three boxes and the boxes would
be left outside and detainees would have to call the guards if
they would like to relieve themselves.
Q. So who would discard the human waste?
A. For the human waste a detainee would be allowed to ask to
collect and to be discarded at the toilets.
Q. Were you sure or are you sure that one detainee would be
allowed to leave the room to discard the human waste?
A. I am sure.  I saw it.
Q. Did you see these incidents in the common room, and in which
building was it -- in which room also?
A. It was at the north building on the second floor.
Q. Do you remember who actually ordered a detainee that his cuff
or shackle removed and that he had to discard the waste?
A. If it fell on any group duty then it was the person in charge
of the group who ordered the detainee to have them discarded.
Q. So when detainees got sick or wounded did they receive any
treatment?  If so, how?
A. There were medics who regularly paid a visit to treat the
detainees.
Q. During the time that you guarded inside the compound how long
had you worked as the guard?
A. I started to work as the guard ever since I had been relocated
from the PJ prison until late 1978 or early 1979 because in late
'78 I was asked to work with the typewriter and typing documents.
Q. When you studied how to use typewriter were you assigned to
work at the administration of S-21 or were you assigned to work
elsewhere?
A. I worked for the interrogation unit.
Q. Who taught you how to interrogate a detainee?
A. It was Kak who taught me how to interrogate detainees and I
was asked to bring in a detainee and then he asked me to
interrogate him and he was watching.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated.  The Chamber is now back in session.
We continue to hear the testimony of this witness.
I would like now to give the floor again to Judge Ya Sokhan to
continue his questions to the witness.
JUDGE YA SOKHAN:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY JUDGE YA SOKHAN:
Q. The teaching of how to interrogate prisoners, where was it
held and how many people attended the training?
A. For interrogation training, it was done, it was held at the
interrogation location.  It was done one-on-one.  It means I was
sitting while the person was interrogating the prisoner.
Q. Did you study interrogation techniques from this accused?
A. I did not study it with him; I studied the interrogation
techniques with Kak, who was the unit chief.
Q. Did you know who transferred you to the interrogation team and
who assigned Kak to teach you how to interrogate?
A. Regarding the transfer or the assignment, I did not know.  I
was only told that I would be assigned to work under Kak to
interrogate prisoners.
Q. When you studied interrogation techniques from Kak, did Kak
tell you the method of how to interrogate regarding the CIA, the
KGB or the Vietnamese spies?
A. For the interrogation technique study, yes, the words CIA, KGB
or the Labour Party, those terms were taught.
Q. What did they teach you regarding the CIA?
A. For CIA, we were taught that they were the secret agents of
America and that's how we were taught at the time.
Q. What about the KGB?
A. KGB was the federal federation of -- from the Russian agents.
Q. What about the Vietnamese Labor Party?  What type of agent was
it?
A. Regarding the Vietnamese Labor Party they were the Vietnamese
agents.
Q. Did you know who actually determined if a person is an enemy?
A. Regarding this role I did not know who would make such a
decision but we were taught that whoever was arrested and brought
to that location they were the enemy.  They were either the CIA,
KGB, or the Vietnamese spies.
Q. When Kak taught you how to interrogate were there any lessons
or any books which were used as samples?
A. Regarding the study of the interrogation techniques, there was
no book or any sample.  It was hands-on practice.  That is, I sit
and watch him interrogating the prisoners.
Q. The first question that you were taught for asking the
prisoners, what was it?
A. The first question to ask is the biography of the prisoner and
later on to questions, the reasons for their arrest by the Party.
Q. What questions were you taught to ask next?
A. After questioning about the reasons that they were arrested by
Angkar then it depended on the responses of the prisoners, if
they confessed or not.  If they said they did not confess then we
would stress on that point.
Q. Were you asked to ask the questions to the prisoner to
implicate anybody?
A. Regarding whether we were asked to ask the prisoners to
implicate anybody, no.  It depended on the responses of the
prisoners.
Q. The purpose of interrogating a prisoner, what was the actual
purpose for the interrogation?
A. The purpose of the interrogation was to extract the response
from the prisoner who was a traitor and then their network.
Q. Did you know who was the chief of the interrogation unit and
how many teams were there in the interrogation unit?
A. I did not know who was the chief of the interrogation unit.
However, Hor and Pon and Chan, they were the senior cadres in the
interrogation unit.  I did not know how many teams there were in
the interrogation unit.  I only knew my team.  I did not know
about the rest of the teams within the interrogation unit.
Q. What team were you in, in the interrogation unit, and who was
your team chairman?
A. First I was with Norn.  He was the Interrogation team chief
and later on Heng and after that I was with Nan.  I was with Nan
until Phnom Penh fell.
Q. Were interrogators assigned to various teams based on the
types of the prisoners; for example, the most important prisoners
or the female prisoners?
A. There were different teams assigned to different types of
prisoners.  Chan and Hor, for example, they were in charge of
interrogating important prisoners or those foreigners or
westerners or the female cadres.  My team would only interrogate
ordinary prisoners or less important prisoners.
Q. In the interrogation unit were there any assignments of the
teams; for example, the hot team, the cold team, or the chewing
team?
A. Regarding the hot, cold, or chewing teams, I did not know
about them.  I was new and I was still studying interrogation
techniques so I did not know the details of the interrogation
unit yet.
Q. Were there such various teams, for example, hot, cold, and
chewing within the interrogation unit?
A. As I just responded, I did not know whether there was such
teams.
Q. Nan, who you said was your team chief, did you know which team
that he belonged to?
A. I did not know if he belonged to any particular team.  I only
knew that he was part of the interrogation unit.
Q. Where were the prisoners taken to be interrogated and where
were the foreigners; where were they interrogated?
A. The prisoners were being taken to be interrogated at the
location in the front office and they would be interrogated by
different interrogators.
Q. Do you mean at the front office, the building just at the
front of the S-21 compound?
A. Yes, it was at the front of the S-21 compound.  It was outside
the barbed wire fence but inside the zinc fence.
Q. Did you ever see the accused interrogate any prisoner?
A. I never saw him interrogate any prisoner.
Q. When you were interrogating a prisoner, did the accused ever
come in and join or observe while you were interrogating?
A. The accused never come into the room while I was
interrogating.  I only saw him or met him while I was at the
dining hall or at the political training school.
Q. Who made a decision for you to interrogate any particular
prisoners, and was the order done in writing or it's done
verbally?
A. The order for me to interrogate a prisoner was given to me in
writing by my team chief from Kak or from Norn or Heng at various
times.  So I was given that letter and then I would go and take
that prisoner to be interrogated.
Q. Who wrote on that letter or who authorized it?
A. I did not know whose writing was on that letter.  I only
looked at the name on that letter, then I would go and take that
prisoner for the interrogation.
Q. In the annotation on that piece of paper, did you see any
signature?
A. Yes, there was a signature from my team chief.
Q. Did your team chief have the authority to sign on that
document, on the paper?
A. I did not know but I was given that piece of document, so I
went to take the prisoner based on a name in that document.
Q. You talk about a signature.  Whose signature was that; the
signature of the person who annotated or authorized a prisoner to
be interviewed or to be interrogated?
A. The letter was given to me by my team chief and there was,
actually, no name of the person who wrote or annotated on that
letter.
Q. You said you got that written letter, so whom did you give
that letter to?
A. After I got the letter with the name of the prisoner for the
interrogation, then I would give the letter to the guard who
guarded inside the room.  Then the guard would bring the prisoner
out for me, to be interrogated.
Q. If that letter was not yet given to the registrar or the
record-keeper, how could you know that which room the prisoner
was detained?
A. I did not know which room the prisoner was detained but when I
was given the letter, the letter also contained the name of the
person and the room where the prisoner was detained.
Q. Did you ever take that letter to Suos Thy, who was in charge
of the record-keeping, and later on Suos Thy would annotate on
the paper the room and the building of such a prisoner?
A. I did not know the process.  I was given a piece of paper with
the name of the prisoner, the serial number of the prisoner and
the room number where the prisoner was detained, and the building
number.
Q. When you got the letter, whom did you hand the letter in, and
after you received the prisoner what happened next?
A. When I received the letter, I went there and there was a book
on the table.  I recorded the name of the prisoner, the room
number, and then I would write my name and I sign it that I take
this prisoner to be interrogated.  And then the guard would take
the prisoner and bring him to me.
Q. When the guard brought the prisoner to you, what state was the
prisoner in?  Was the prisoner blindfolded and handcuffed?
A. When the prisoner was brought to me, the prisoner was
handcuffed and blindfolded.
Q. The prisoner who was walked to the interrogation location, did
you walk the prisoner or the guard walked the prisoner?
A. I, myself, walked the prisoner from the detention room into
the interrogation room where I would interrogate that person.
Q. How far was it from that detention room and your interrogation
room?
A. It was like 20 to 30 metres away from the barbed wire fence.
So it was outside the barbed wire fence.
Q. After you brought the prisoner to the interrogation room, what
happened next?
A. After the prisoner was taken to the interrogation room, he
would be shackled, then I would remove the tie, the hand tie, and
the blindfold.
Q. How many people involved in the interrogation?
A. Only one interrogator per room.  For example, if I was
interrogating a prisoner I would be alone.  And after I finished
interrogating the person then Hor would come and inquire about
the result of the interrogation; whether the prisoner responded
or not.
Q. How was the confession of the prisoner recorded?
A. The confession was handwritten or typed or photocopied.
Q. When you finished interrogating a prisoner, whom did you have
to report to?
A. After an interrogation completed I would give the documents to
the team chief, Kak or Norn or Seng or Nan.
Q. Did you ever report the completion of your interrogations
directly to the accused?
A. I never reported directly to him.  It had to go through the
network.
Q. Who decided if an interrogation was complete?
A. The decision whether it was complete or not depending on the
confession of the prisoner.
Q. If the person whom you had to report to say that interrogation
was not yet complete, was there any annotation from that person
back to you?
A. I never received any annotation or documents asking me to
continue the interrogation.  If the accused, for example -- Duch
-- had any query regarding any interrogation he would use his
telephone to make inquiries to the interrogators themselves.
Q. So it means that after you reported the confession of the
prisoners to the upper echelon, and if it was unclear, did the
accused himself ever call you directly to make further
interrogation?
A. Yes, it happened.  He used to telephone me that the
interrogation of this particular prisoner was not yet complete or
not yet appropriate.
Q. Did he telephone you directly?
A. Yes, he telephoned me directly.
Q. Could you recognize his voice at the time?
A. Yes, I recognized his voice very clearly.
Q. After being interrogated where would detainees be sent to?
Where they kept in S 21?
A. I don't know about this because I was asked to interrogate
detainees, then I would only know to that limit.  And when I was
asked to stand guard then I knew only I had to guard the
detainees.
Q. Did you ever interrogate female detainees?
A. No, I didn't.
Q. Were all the detainees interrogated or were there any
exceptions?
A. When I was still on guard or worked as a guard, there were
some detainees who left alone without being interrogated and who
later on disappeared or removed.
Q. Who interrogated the Vietnamese prisoners of war?
A. Regarding the prisoners of wars, I had no idea.  I learned
that the bodyguards of Pon or Chan would take those people to Pon
or Chan to have them interrogated.
Q. What about the westerners who were detained there?
A. I don't know anything else about the other foreigners.  I only
learned that Pon and Chan's bodyguards would take them to be
interrogated.
Q. Can you tell the Court how much time was needed to interrogate
each detainee?
A. It was not a regular time set.  Sometimes to interrogate a
detainee would take like one week or so.  Some detainees did not
read or write or they did not want to respond to interrogation,
so it would take longer in such incidents.
Q. Do you still remember how many detainees had you interrogated
until the day you left S-21?
A. Personally I interrogated very few of them, three or four,
because I had just been trained and I was on training, and when I
was under supervision of Kak when I was taught to interrogate,
there were about 10 people who I interrogated under his watch.
Q. Do you remember the names of the detainees you interrogated?
A. It has been long, long time ago.  I'm afraid I don't remember
any of them.
Q. You were allowed to question or to interrogate detainees.
Were you allowed, or can I conclude that interrogators were
allowed to torture detainees or you had to seek permission first
before you could do so?
A. Violence against any detainees would not be allowed to
ordinary interrogators like me.  We could insult the detainees or
threaten them but we could not physically abuse them.
Q. Who instructed you to do that?
A. It was the chief of the unit or the group, Kak, Norn and Nan
would do that.
Q. In cases, for example, when detainees did not fully give the
full confession and tortures were subjected, so who would order
such tortures practices?
A. Regarding those detainees who did not respond or not
completely respond to the interrogation, it was Hor who
personally paid a visit to us and ordered us to grab a branch of
tree.
Q. So Hor asked you to pick the branch of the guava trees to beat
the detainees.  Is that correct?
A. Yes, it is correct, Your Honour.  Hor did ask me to pick the
stick to beat detainees.
Q. Were you ever instructed by Duch to use tortures against any
detainees?
A. Duch never ever instructed or ordered me to use tortures or
violence against any detainee but during the study session we
would be instructed of how we could do in the interrogation
session, but not in the interrogation session itself that Duch
came.
Q. So did Duch teach at that location?
A. Duch taught us but he did not instruct us to use tortures, but
he did want us to play politics, to make sure that we obtained
confessions, and we were asked to refrain from leading the
enemies to give their confession, but I was not told to use
tortures by him.  Most often it was Hor who accompanied me in the
interrogation sessions and who inflicted torture onto the
detainees.
Q. What kind of tortures were used at S-21 toward detainees?
A. When I was on training to interrogate detainees with Kak, Kak
would torture the detainees with a branch of the guava tree and
that he used a kind of device to hurt the ears of the detainee,
and that's what I saw.
Q. Did you ever see or were you ever instructed to use plastic
bag or to pull out nails from the detainees?
A. Regarding the plastic bag being covered on any detainee or
water would be dropped into the nostrils of detainees; I don't
think I remember having seen or having been instructed regarding
this matter.
Q. Had you ever seen any instruments of tortures, including the
frame in which the detainee would be hoisted to the air and
plunged into the water jar?
A. I did not ever see this kind of practice.
Q. Did you ever see any kind of violence or tortures being
inflicted onto any female detainee?
A. Detainees were taken to be interrogated elsewhere and it was
far from being seen.
Q. Did you ever see any children who would accompany their
parents, and where would they be taken to?
A. I have no idea or I don't remember having seen any children
being brought along with their parents.
Q. Had you ever seen any tortures being used on the westerners?
A. No, I didn't, because I never witnessed any interrogation
session of those people.
Q. What about the Vietnamese prisoners of war?  Did you ever
witness such tortures be inflicted onto them?
A. No, I didn't.
Q. Do you know, when tortures when used during interrogation
session, what was the purpose of using such torture?
A. During the interrogation of course we would like to obtain
confession.  We want to know the networks, the strings or
associates of the detainee.
Q. Did you ever witness any tortures received by the staff
members of S-21?
A. I never saw any member of the staff at S-21 be interrogated.
We never even saw their face because they would be covered in
blankets, let alone having seen them being tortured.
Q. So who walked the staff members of S-21 while they were being
covered by blankets?
A. They were the bodyguards of Chan and Pon and Hor who would be
walking them.
Q. You said when staff members of S-21 were covered with blankets
and walked by the bodyguards of Chan or Hor or Pon, so where
would they be taken to be interrogated?
A. They were taken to be interrogated in the front of the
building which was to the south of the place where I worked.
There was a street crossing and to the other side of the road,
and there were some houses along that road where those detainees
would be interrogated.
Q. Did you ever see any detainee's blood was being drawn?
A. No, I didn't.
Q. Had you ever heard from your colleagues?
A. No, I hadn't, because friends did not share this with me.
Q. Did you ever see any detainees who were cut for the anatomy
purposes?
A. No, I didn't.
Q. Did you ever see any detainees being released after they were
interrogated?
A. No, I didn't.  I never knew of it or I never witnessed it.
Q. If you never saw any release of such detainees, did you know
what happened to them later on?
A. I have no idea because after the interrogations they would be
removed and placed in insulated trucks, and I did not know where
they would be sent to.  That's all what I learned about it.
Q. Did you ever note that detainees would be killed at S-21 too?
A. I never saw them being killed at S-21 or I never knew that
they would be killed there.
Q. Do you know Choeung Ek?
A. When I worked at the military technical schools, I was
assigned to build -- or to dig canals there, so I knew it back
then.  Now, it is the place where the remains of the people who
were executed there are kept and I paid the last visit to that
location.
Q. During the time when you had worked at that location, did you
learn from your friends that detainees would be taken there to be
exterminated?
A. I didn't know where they would be taken to.
Q. According to your accounts of the event, you had worked at
S-21 for a significant period of time.  Do you remember how many
medics were there at the compound?
A. There were about four to five of them.  They were assigned to
treat detainees.
Q. Do you remember some of their names, and who was the last
medic standing at S-21?
A. I only know medic Soeung who left Phnom Peng with me and we
met at a later date.  I only know this person very well.
Q. Were there any female medics at S-21?
A. There were no female detainees because I observed there were
only male medics.
Q. Were there any male or child medics?
A. I did not see child medics.  There were teenagers who were
medics.
Q. Do you remember those medics?
A. As I told already, I remember only Soeung, or I still remember
another one, Yan.  So two of them and I don't know the rest.  And
we worked in a different unit, that's why we did not know one
another.
Q. Did you know medic, Sek Dan?
A. I know him.
Q. What was the role of Sek Dan back then at S-21?
A. He was perhaps a medic.  I only recognized his face.  I did
not remember what kind of work he performed at S-21 because I did
not pay great attention to his work and performance.
Q. Do you remember that you saw this person at S-21?
A. I know Sek Dan very well because we were in the same training,
and I did not only know what he worked as at S-21.  That's all;
but I know him.
JUDGE YA SOKHAN:
I have no further questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judges of the Bench, would you wish to put further questions to
the witness?
Judge Lavergne, you take the floor.
BY JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Q. Yes, good evening, Mr. Mean.
Could you please tell us if in the rooms where you were
interrogating, if there were specific instructions that were
displayed on the walls?
A. I don't remember having seen any such instruction but I may
not wish to respond to that question.  I'm sorry.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Maybe, Mr. President, in order to make this question a bit more
understandable, it might be possible to display on the screen the
document indexed ERN in Khmer, 00181448?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The AV Unit is instructed to put this document as read out by
Judge Lavergne on the screen.
(Microphone not activated)
MR. PRESIDENT
Mr. Sek Dan, would you please look at these writings in the
document, it shows that these writing was written on the
whiteboard and placed in the interrogation room, so as the
interrogator did you ever see such regulations during the time
when you last interrogated the detainees?
Once again, did you ever see any kind of writing on the
whiteboard; for example:
"Santebal Security Police Regulations.  One, you must answer
according to my questions.  Do not turn them away.  Two, do not
try to hide the facts by making pretexts of this and that.  You
are strictly prohibited to contest me."
And so on and so forth until point number 9.
Have you ever or did you ever see such regulations written on the
board in the room where you interrogated detainees?
A. At that time there was no such board with such regulations
being written on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The AV Unit is now instructed to remove this view from the
screen.
BY JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Q. So if you did not see those instructions were these
instructions given to you orally?  In the training that you
followed did you have to deal with these kinds of instructions?
A. I was only instructed while I was interrogating detainees, so
it was the instruction on the job and that there was no such
written regulations being placed in the interrogation room, and I
had to only learn from the other interrogators how detainees
would be interrogated.
Q. Well, regarding the techniques, earlier on you spoke about a
machine that was placed behind the ears.  What was the purpose of
this machine and what was its effect?
A. Regarding the shocking with electricity, it was like using a
dynamo of a bicycle to produce the electricity to shock the
prisoner.
Q. Did you know among the S-21 staff a certain Kok Sros?
A. I myself did not know Kok Sros.  I did not hear such a name.
Q. So you never met him, neither in Ta Khmau or neither at the PJ
nor at S-21?
A. No, I never met this person.  I did not know him.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Well, I have no further questions to put to this witness but I
would like to know what is the accused's stance, and if he
recognizes the witness, and if he recognizes this witness as
having been part of the S-21 staff and having taken part in
interrogations.
THE ACCUSED:
Your Honour, regarding this witness, I am hesitated to confirm.
Firstly, the reasons for me to believe that he was a former S-21
staff, there were many reasons.  I would like to inform the
Chamber that I had a sentimental feeling towards the Kampong
Tralach Leu people because I also married a woman from Kampong
Tralach Leu and I also recruited a lot of combatants from Kampong
Tralach Leu.  This witness would fit into the criterion for me to
select and recruit.
In the entire testimony regarding the S-21 location in Phnom Penh
it sounds plausible if we only consider the evidence which does
not provide any inculpatory evidence against me.  However, I have
a firm position that for anyone who is not an S-21 staff, to
involve that person, to involve him in S-21.  Because as we all
know, S-21 is a criminal mechanism.  Secondly, I did not want
anyone who was not under my direct subordination to be part of
this mechanism.
So I would like to raise my observations and my suspicions
regarding certain points in his testimony.  I did not want any
militia districts to be part of my staff.  I only want youths who
did not actually involve in any unit or group yet to be recruited
to be part of my staff, and this person, this Lach Mean, caused
me hesitation to decide what type of person he was; whether he
actually came to work at S-21.  I am still uncertain on this
matter.  And a second issue, he talked about his role to guard
the prisoners in Ta Khmau, and what he said was contradictory to
the situation at Ta Khmau at the time.
The third point, talking about the police in Phnom Penh, which
was called PJ, and the Khmer Rouge would say the PS, I only the
one who used those terminology with the Co-Investigating Judges
and before this Chamber.  That is the headquarters, the police
headquarters in Phnom Penh, and I think it was inappropriate for
him to use such exact terminology or phrase to refer to the PJ
location.
Finally, he talked about me telephoned him to provide
instructions.  This is very strange.  When he interrogated a
person named Pen Samorn and I tried to research, based on the
list of S-21, but I could not find such a name, and the
combination of all these points make me hesitated to confirm my
position, and I will try to look through the list again to find
his name; that is, the name of the interrogators at S-21.
Or if he can recall the names of the prisoners whom he
interrogated and that he provided his signature on those
confessions that would provide documentary evidence to prove his
position, and this is my observation, Your Honour.
BY MR. PRESIDENT:
Q. Mr. Lach Mean, your testimony and the responses to Judge Ya
Sokhan regarding the common dining hall used by the S-21 staff,
was there only one location of a dining hall or were there many?
A. Regarding the dining hall at S-21, there were two.  One was
for the guard unit and one was for the interrogation unit.  For
the economic section and for the prisoners they had their own
separate unit location.
Q. The dining hall for the guard unit, where was it located or
which street was it located?  Can you elaborate further regarding
the common dining hall or the kitchen for the guard unit and the
interrogation unit?
A. The dining hall for the guard unit originally was behind the
fence of the genocidal museum, and for the interrogation unit it
was to the right of the museum.  It was along the street to the
right, leading towards the main road.  So as I said, the kitchen
hall for the guard unit it was toward the back and to the west.
Q. So they were a distance apart?  How far was it from the two
locations?  That is the dining hall for the guard unit and for
the interrogation unit.
A. When I was with the guard unit the dining hall was far.  I
think it was like 200 metres away.  Later on, I think towards
late 1978, then the guard unit was relocated, so one was to the
west, one was to the north of the street and one to the south of
the street.  The interrogation unit's dining hall was to the
south of the street.
Q. Comparing the location of the present Tuol Sleng location,
where was the dining hall for the S-21 staff and cadres?
A. It was to the south of the museum.  It was at the corner, at
the south corner.
Q. Did you recognize or know the location where the prisoners
were brought in and handed over to another group in order to
receive them?
A. The location where the prisoners were received were usually at
the front of the main entrance.  Most of the time prisoners were
transported and they were dropped at the main entrance of the
compound.
Q. You also said regarding the interrogation location which was
at the outside of the barbed wire fence but it was inside the
zinc fence.  The question is the zinc fence to the east of the
compound, where was it located?
A. The zinc fence which was used to surround the location at the
junction of all the streets and it was 100 metres from the barbed
wire fence.
Q. To the east did they have it popped or installed near the
sewage canal along that street?  Did you know that?
A. Towards the east one street was not fenced but the smaller
streets were erected with a zinc fence along the sewage canal;
that is, immediately to the west of the sewage canal.
Q. So it means that the fence was installed but there was enough
path for people to walk through?
A. The path was quite large.  It almost filled a street.
Q. To the south where was the zinc fence erected?
A. To the south the zinc fence was erected along the street.
Q. Can you specify further to the south which location where the
zinc fence was erected?
A. It was erected at the street adjacent to Tuol Tumpoung.
Q. What about to the north?  So to the north of the S-21 where
was the zinc fence erected?
A. I was not sure where the zinc fence was erected to the north
because at that time I did not go into that area.  I would say
the zinc fence was erected 100 metres away from the barbed wire
fence.
Q. When you was assigned to work at Ta Khmau, at the PJ, and
later on at the Security Office of S-21 did you ever have any
permission to leave those locations in order to travel outside;
for example, to visit your home village?
A. I was never allowed to leave S-21 unit.  I was like a prisoner
there.  The staff working there were never allowed to leave
because the work there was secretive and we were instructed not
to leave outside, otherwise we would break the secrecy of the
nature of the work.  So we actually never left outside the
parameter of the zinc fence.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Lach Mean.  Today you have been put questions
by the Chamber and other parties have not yet questioned you, so
the Chamber needs you to be here again tomorrow morning to
