PROCEEDINGS
(Court opens at 0901H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Court is now in session.
Today, the Chamber hears testimony of a witness, 2-TCW-920,
through a video link from Battambang province. We also have a
reserve witness<, Nuon Trech,> whom we heard yesterday.
And today, the witness is a reserved witness.
Ms. Se Kolvuthy, please report the attendance of the parties and
other individuals to today's proceedings.
THE GREFFIER:
Mr. President, for today's proceedings, all parties to this case
are present.
And Marie Guiraud, the International Lead Co-Lawyer for civil
parties, will be absent for the first session today for personal
reasons.
Mr. Nuon Chea is present in the holding cell downstairs. He has
waived his rights to be present in the courtroom. The waiver has
been delivered to the greffier.
The witness who is to testify today, that is, 2-TCW-920, confirms
that, to his best knowledge, he has no relationship, by blood or
by law, to any of the two accused, that is, Nuon Chea and Khieu
Samphan, or any of the civil parties admitted in this case.
The witness took an oath on the 5th of December 2016, and he is
testifying via video link from Battambang. He also has Mr. Mam
Rithea as his duty counsel.
We also have a reserve witness<, Nuon Trech,> waiting to be
called by the Chamber. It has been informed that the video link
is established and the witness is ready to testify.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. The Chamber now decides on the request by Nuon Chea.
The Chamber has received a waiver from Nuon Chea, dated 6
December 2016, which states that, due to his health, that is,
headache, back pain, he cannot sit or concentrate for long. In
order to effectively participate in future hearings, he requests
to waive his right to be present at the 6 December 2016 hearing.
Having seen the medical report of Nuon Chea by the duty doctor
for the accused at the ECCC, dated 6 December 2016, which notes
that, today, Nuon Chea has a lower back pain and feels dizzy when
he sits for long and recommends that the Chamber shall grant him
his request so that he can follow the proceedings remotely from
the holding cell downstairs.
Based on the above information and pursuant to Rule 81.5 of the
ECCC Internal Rules, the Chamber grants Nuon Chea his request to
follow today's proceedings remotely from the holding cell
downstairs via an audio-visual means.
The Chamber instructs the AV Unit personnel to link the
proceedings to the room downstairs so that Nuon Chea can follow.
That applies for the whole day.
And before we begin hearing testimony of witness 2-TCW-920, the
Chamber notes that this witness has been interviewed in an
ongoing investigation in another case, and the International
Co-Investigating Judge put this witness in Group A in his
memorandum, that is, E319/35, and requests that pseudonym shall
be used for this witness in order to protect the confidentiality
of the investigation.
The Chamber deems this limited measure is legally appropriate in
this case, and this instruction shall take into account the
balance between the need for public hearings and the integrity of
the investigation.
The Chamber reminds the parties that they shall adhere strictly
to the instructions in document E319/7 for the use of documents,
which have been disclosed from other cases.
<In response to the request of the witness,> the Chamber, through
WESU, provides a duty counsel to this witness during his
testimony, and the counsel is Mam Rithea.
QUESTIONING BY MR. PRESIDENT:
Q. Good morning, Mr. Witness.
Again, good morning, Mr. Witness.
2-TCW-920:
A. Yes.
Q. Witness, are you ready to testify?
A. Yes, I am ready.
Q. Thank you.
And per the request by the International Co-Investigating Judge,
throughout the proceedings to hear your testimony, you'd only be
referred to by pseudonym, that is, 2-TCW-920. And generally,
parties will refer to you as "witness".
And the Chamber will not allow parties, including Judges of the
Bench, to refer to your full name in this public proceeding.
And because the witness is <old>, although he can read, the
Chamber requests Mam Rithea to assist the witness. And if that is
the case, please, you should only whisper to the witness.
And Mr. Mam Rithea, the greffier <> prepared a document for the
witness to view, that is, E3/9473 at Khmer, ERN 00945416;
English, 00976956; and French, 00967262.
Please show the document to the witness so that he can read the
highlighted portion in orange, specifically, that is your full
names, nationality, date of birth, place of birth, occupation,
the names of your parents, your wife and the number of your
children, whether the information is correct.
And after you read it, please simply say it is correct or not
correct.
A. It is correct.
Q. Thank you.
And Mr. Witness, the greffier made an oral report that you are
not related, by blood or by law, to any of the two accused, that
is, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, or any of the civil parties
admitted in this case. Is the report correct?
A. Yes, it is correct.
Q. Have you taken an oath according to your belief and religion?
A. Yes.
Q. Mr. Witness, have you taken an oath according to your religion
before you appeared to testify before us?
A. I have.
Q. Thank you.
And the Chamber would like to inform you of your rights and
obligations as a witness.
Your rights: As a witness in the proceedings before the Chamber,
you may refuse to respond to any question or to make any comment,
which may incriminate you, that is, your right against
self-incrimination.
Your obligations: As a witness in the proceedings before the
Chamber, you must respond to any questions by the Bench or
relevant parties, except where your response or comments to those
questions may incriminate you. And as a witness, you must tell
the truth that you have known, heard, seen, remembered,
experienced or observed directly about an event or occurrence
relevant to the questions that the Bench or parties pose to you.
And Mr. Witness, have you been interviewed by investigators from
the Office of the Co-Investigating Judges of the ECCC?
<A. Yes, I have. I can follow it.>
Q. Witness, have you been interviewed by investigators from this
Khmer Rouge Tribunal?
2-TCW-920:
A. Yes.
Q. And before you appear before us, have you read or have it read
out to you, that is, regarding your written record of your
interview with investigators in order to refresh your memory?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. And to your recollection, does the written record of your
statement conform to what you told the investigators?
A. Yes, I have read it in full.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And because the witness is old, that is, he is 93 years old, and
it is also difficult to hear him when he speaks, so parties
please make sure that your questions are short and precise so
that the witness can answer your questions.
(Short pause)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And pursuant to Rule 91bis of the ECCC, the Chamber grants the
floor first to the Co-Prosecutors before other parties. And the
combined time for the Co-Prosecutors and the Lead Co-Lawyers are
two Court sessions.
QUESTIONING BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Good morning, Mr. President. Good morning, Your Honours. Good
morning to all parties.
Q. Good morning, Witness. My name is Vincent de Wilde, and I'm
going to put a few questions to you on behalf of the
Co-Prosecutors.
If you do not understand one of my questions, please ask me to
repeat that question. And I will also ask you to provide me with
concise answers. If I need more detail, I will put other
questions to you, so try to answer as precisely as possible to
the questions that are put to you.
And I am aware of the fact that the <events> are old and it's not
very easy to remember <everything>, so if you do not remember
something, simply tell us that you do not remember.
So I have a few topics to discuss, first your general personal
history before the capture of Phnom Penh and, in particular, what
you did in the 1950s and 1960s with Ros Nhim and Ta Nuon Chea,
and then I will have a few questions regarding your duties after
17 April 1975. And I will focus then on the arrests that took
place in the Northwest Zone before and after the arrest of Ros
Nhim.
So first, regarding the 1950s and 1960s, could you tell us when,
exactly, you joined the revolution and for which leader did you
work?
2-TCW-1065:
A. I joined the revolution in <1960>, and in fact, it was '66.
Q. You mentioned, rather, the 1950s in your various statements,
so are you sure that you're not mixing up 1966 with 1956? In
particular, I'm referring to WRI E3/9473 at answer 2.
You said that you were with the Khmer Issarak until 1954 and then
you joined the Khmer Rouge in 1956, thanks to sponsoring <from>Ta
Phat. <P-H-A-T>.
A. <In> the fifties, I was with the Issarak movement, and at
around '66, I joined the Khmer Rouge.
Q. So did you work with Ros Nhim and Nuon Chea and, if yes, when?
A. That happened a long time ago <that I worked with Ros Nhim and
Nuon Chea>. I was assigned as a courier between Battambang and
Phnom Penh.
Q. How did you fulfil your duties? Who appointed you as a
messenger between Phnom Penh and Battambang?
A. At that time, it was Ta Ros Nhim.
Q. And in Phnom Penh, to whom would you deliver messages?
A. Nuon Chea was in Phnom Penh.
Q. Fine. So as of which year did you work as a messenger between
Nuon Chea and Ros Nhim, and up until which period?
A. I worked as a messenger since 1966.
Q. Well, I know that it might be hard for you to remember the
dates, but in your WRI, E3/9473, this is what you said at answer
2:
"In 1960, Ta Nuon Chea appointed me messenger for Ta Nhim. I had
to carry his letters from Battambang <province> to Phnom Penh to
give them to Nuon Chea. In 1966, I fled to hide in Samlout
district." End of quote -- "because I was <unmasked>."
So does that correspond to your memories, that this -- that you
were a messenger between 1960 and 1966 when you were a messenger
between Ros Nhim and Nuon Chea?
A. After the information was leaked, <they searched for me for
the arrest, so> I fled to the forest.
Q. So when you worked as a messenger between Nuon Chea and Ros
Nhim or, rather, when you worked as a messenger for Ros Nhim
delivering messages to Nuon Chea, did both of these leaders trust
you?
A. Yes, they trusted me. That's why I was assigned as a messenger
to carry messages back and forth. So when they knew that I could
work for them, they allowed me to work. But in 1966, I went into
hiding in Samlout.
Q. So you enjoyed Ros Nhim and Nuon Chea's trust between 1960 and
1966. But later, during the DK regime, that is to say, between
'75 and '79, did both of these leaders still trust you?
A. Yes, they trusted me.
Q. Can you tell us what Nuon Chea's role was in the 1960s within
the Party?
A. After they trusted me, later on, I was enrolled as a Party
member.
Q. What was Nuon Chea's role in the Party back then? Was he one
of the main leaders?
A. Nuon Chea was in Phnom Penh.
Q. Do you know if he had any position within the Standing
Committee of the Party?
A. I only knew that he worked in Phnom Penh, and I worked for Ros
Nhim. He sent me to carry messages back and forth.
Q. Back then, within the Party, who was of a higher rank than the
other; was it Nuon Chea who held the highest rank, or was it Ros
Nhim?
<A. Nuon Chea held a higher rank -->
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, please hold on.
And Counsel Koppe, you have the floor.
MR. KOPPE:
I object to the formulation of this question. There is a third
alternative, that they were both equally ranking, since both were
members of the Standing Committee.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Well, then, I will rephrase the question, but first I'll put
another question to the witness.
Q. Witness, did you see, yourself, Nuon Chea and Ros Nhim
together, whether in Phnom Penh or in Battambang?
2-TCW-920:
A. Nuon Chea was in Phnom Penh, while Ros Nhim was in Battambang.
Q. Did one or the other travel to go meet the <other>? Did Ros
Nhim go to Phnom Penh to meet Nuon Chea, or did Nuon Chea go to
Battambang to meet Ros Nhim while you were a messenger?
A. They <rarely> met each other<.> I was sent as a messenger to
carry messages. Ros Nhim was the one who <grasped the situation
of> the people on the ground <in villages, communes, and Samlout
district>, while Nuon Chea was in Phnom Penh.
Q. Fine. Well, I'm not going to dwell on this, but I think that
you said in some of your statements that Nuon Chea came to see Ta
Kao or Ta Sambat, that is to say, the other names for Ros Nhim in
a place called Ponlei at Srae Chas. That is something you said in
E3/9084, and you said this before the interviewers at DC-Cam. In
French, it's at . The English draft, whose translation is
<rather> poor, is on . And in Khmer it's at ERN 00057650.
Witness, do you remember having said that Nuon Chea came to see
Ros Nhim in Srae Chas in a place called Ponlei?
A. <Nuon Chea sometimes> came from Phnom Penh and disembarked the
train at <Phsar Ou Dambang (phonetic) train station in> Samlout
<district to meet Ros Nhim there>. That was the upper part of
that area.
Q. Very well. When you saw Nuon Chea arrive, you also talk of the
presence of Ros Nhim. Who respected the one more than the other?
Did they consider one another as equals, or the one considered
himself superior to the other in the hierarchy?
A. Ros Nhim respected Nuon Chea, and Nuon Chea was higher in
rank.
Q. What did you know of Siev, S-I-E-V, and Heng, H-E-N-G, in the
communist movement and of his ties with Nuon Chea?
<A. Nuon Chea was a person from Voat Kor. Ros Nhim was
(unintelligible).>
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Witness, could you please repeat your answer? I have not heard
what you said regarding Siev Heng.
2-TCW-920:
A. <Nuon Chea was -->
JUDGE FENZ:
There is no translation.
(Short pause)
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is <also> very difficult to understand what he said in Khmer,
and it's very difficult for interpreters, I believe, to interpret
his messages.
AV Unit, could you please increase the volume because the
testimony given by this witness is very difficult to understand,
so please coordinate with the staff members over there so that
the witness could be a bit closer to the mic or the sound is
better.
(Short pause)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Co-Prosecutor, you may now resume your questioning, and
please repeat your last question.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Thank you, Mr. President.
Q. Witness, I had just put a question to you regarding Siev Heng.
I asked you what you knew about him within the revolutionary
movement as well as <regarding> his ties with Nuon Chea.
Can you please repeat your answer?
2-TCW-920:
A. <Siev Heng was also a person from Voat Kor. His native
birthplace is where Nuon Chea came from, that was Voat Kor.>
Nuon Chea came to <hide himself in> Phnom Penh, and Ros Nhim was
stationed in Battambang. And I carried messages to Phnom Penh
and, also, I brought messages and letters from Phnom Penh to
Battambang.
MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Very well. We did not receive the interpretation of what you
said on Siev Heng, but let me read out to you what you told
DC-Cam, document E3/9084,  in French. And the English
draft, it's on , and in Khmer 00057640.
I'll perhaps first read before <the> defence counsel can speak;
otherwise, we will not be able to make progress.
This is what you said, witness, "Siev Heng" --
MR. KONG SAM ONN:
It's not the objection I wish to put. The Co-Prosecutor said that
he did not get the -- get the interpretation. <I want to confirm
what the witness just said. He said that> Siev Heng and <Nuon
Chea came from Voat Kor. Ros Nhim on the other hand stationed in
Battambang. This is what the witness said>.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Thank you.
Q. Now, Witness, this is what you had stated before:
"Siev Heng was a junior uncle of Nuon Chea. However, Siev Heng
died. He betrayed those close to him in 1962. He betrayed his
supporters and killed them. Later on, it was considered that Siev
Heng was a traitor. At the time of the coup d'état, Siev was
paralyzed and no longer left Voat Kor. Then, in 1975, the war had
ended and he was <pulled away> and executed. He was not spared."
End of quote.
You state that Siev Heng was executed in 1975. Do you know who
ordered his execution?
2-TCW-920:
A. I do not know <who ordered it. But> they worked together,
<whoever> betrayed, <he or she must be dead>.
Q. <Could> this supposed treason by Siev Heng in 1962 <have
contributed> -- within the Party -- to a certain culture of
<distrust> and paranoia?
A. They no longer trusted one another, and there was an order to
smash them.
Q. You stated a while ago that after you had served as a
messenger up to 1966, you went into hiding.
When did you join the revolutionary ranks again? Did you again
join the revolution before the capture of Phnom Penh on the 17th
of April 1975?
A. I went into the forest, and I still had the communication with
other people. <I was searched for the arrest, so I fled into the
forest. However, I did not quit the work,> I was on a constant
communication.
Q. Prior to the fall of Phnom Penh on the 17th of April 1975, did
you join the revolutionary ranks again in a more active manner?
Did you come out of hiding <or forgo your role as> a normal
citizen?
A. After I came out of the forest, I became a chairman of the
schools association. Schools were to be created <for children> in
Ou Dambang Muoy commune.
Q. After the 17th of April 1975, did you hold any duty posts,
particularly in your commune, Ou Dambang Muoy?
A. <In 1975,> I was part of the commune at Ou Dambang Muoy. We
won the victory against Lon Nol's group.
Q. Now, you stated before DC-Cam, E3/9084,  in French, 48
in English, and Khmer 00057670 -- the question that was put to
you was as follows, and it was asked by Dany:
"After the capture of Phnom Penh in 1975, were you immediately
appointed chief of the Ou Dambang cooperative?"
And your answer was: "Yes. Truly, at the beginning, Ou Dambang
commune initially was part of <Sector> Number 4." End of quote.
And then you explained that it subsequently became part of
<Sector> 3.
Is it correct that you were chief of the Ou Dambang cooperative?
A. I was the chairman of a cooperative in Ou Dambang, Sector 3.
Q. Now, I have <two> or <three> questions on the structure of
power in the Northwest Zone.
Who were the leaders in the Northwest Zone? Who were the members
of the Zone Committee?
A. Ros was in charge of that <Sector 3>.
Q. Very well. You also made mention of Ta Kheu (phonetic) on
several occasions as well as Ta Phat (phonetic). Ta Kheu
(phonetic) was deputy secretary, and Ta Phat (phonetic) was <a>
member. Is that correct? Can you confirm that?
A. Ta Phat (phonetic) assigned me a duty so that I could be --
take care -- I could take care of <> Ou Dambang <Cooperative>.
Q. Now, who were the leaders of <Sector> Number 3 as you knew
them?
A. He died already.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Deputy Co-Prosecutor, could you repeat your question? Perhaps
the witness may not have recalled your question.
<2-TCW-920:>
A. Bong Heng Khieu (phonetic) and Bong Ros Nhim.
<Part of the land in> Sangkae <district was annexed> to Sector 3,
and Ros Nhim <was> in charge of Sector Number 3. <It was no long
named Sangkae district, it was instead named Sector 3. Within
this sector, there were> seven communes: <Voat Kor commune>, Ou
<Mal commune,> Chrey <commune>, Phnum Sampov commune, and these
communes were placed under the responsibility of Sector Number 3.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Did you ever hear of leaders at the level of Sector 3, Ta
Chham, C-H-H-A-M, and in Phnom Sampov district, Ta Hoeun
(phonetic)?
In any case, you mentioned their names in your WRI, E3/9473 in
answer number 9.
Do you recall Ta Chham and Ta Hoeun (phonetic)?
2-TCW-920:
A. Ta Chham and Ta Hoeun, they were removed at the later stage
because they conducted an opposing activity. Ta Chham and Ta
Hoeun were removed.
Q. Witness, after the 17th of April 1975 in the Northwest Zone,
what became of the former Lon Nol soldiers or senior officials of
the Lon Nol regime? Were they sought <out>?
A. That issue did not happen at my location. <> At Ou Dambang, I
protected everyone there as long as they could adjust themselves
to the -- as long as they could live together with us<,
regardless of their previous background. On the other hand, other
areas to the east part, particularly in Sector 4,> killings
occurred. Nothing happened at my location <regardless of their
previous backgrounds>. Although they were colonels or had five
strokes on their shoulders, they could survive.
Q. Apart from your area, I have indeed understood that you
protected certain persons.
Outside of your area, was there any systematic search for former
soldiers, ranked officers and former <officials> of Lon Nol and,
if yes, who issued instructions that the search be conducted?
A. Those who worked and live with me could live there very safely
<regardless of their previous ranks.>They could live there
peacefully <as long as they did not oppose us. We let them live.
However, I did not know what happened in other> locations.
Q. In answer number 2 of the WRI, E3/9473, and at the end of the
answer, you said that:
"Ta Chham was a very cruel man. As a matter of fact, after 1975,
soldiers of the Lon Nol government had hidden in the jungle, and
Ta Chham went out in a vehicle in order to <hunt> them down and
capture them." End of quote.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please hold on, Mr. Witness.
You may now proceed, Koppe.
MR. KOPPE:
Yes. The Prosecution continuously forgets the very last sentence,
which says, "But I never saw him kill anyone."
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Witness, when Ta Chham went out in a vehicle in order to
<hunt> down and capture soldiers of the Lon Nol government, did
he act alone or do you know whether he was obeying instructions
from the upper echelon?
2-TCW-920:
A. He wanted to conduct the arrests. He was chasing those people
who went <to hide in> the forest, particularly those who opposed
the plan. <That included Ta Chham.>
Q. There is another passage <which also mentions that,> in the
same WRI, that is, E3/9473, question and answer 27 and 28. And
you said you had to give an account as head of the Ou Dambang
Muoy commune to Ta Hoeng, and this was the question, <number 27>,
that was put to you:
"Apart from the yield of rice paddy fields, what else did you
have to account for?"
Your answer was as follows: "I had to give an account of the
number of people existing in the commune, behavioural problems
among the inhabitants and the existence of enemies in the
village."
Question 28: "Who did you <refer> to when you talk of the
enemies?"
Answer: "The enemies were the officials and government soldiers
of the former regime. They asked us to say whether they had
strange activities or not. I, for my part, reported that those
people <all supported> the Party, all of them." End of quote.
Now, you say in <this> passage that the enemies were the
officials and soldiers of the government of the former regime.
During meetings with you, did Ros Nhim talk about those enemies,
that is, the former soldiers and officials of the Lon Nol
government?
A. <For my side,> as long as they could get along with my people
in my location, although they held higher <or lower ranks>, they
could live peacefully. <Whoever came to live at my location, we
let them live.>
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness does not really understand your question, Deputy
Co-Prosecutor, and the staff member of WESU is Ly Nimol <who
facilitates the video link>.
Are you there?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Mr. President, I am here at the -- in the room.
MR. PRESIDENT:
<Ly Nimol,> please try to help the witness with the questions put
to him. Please try to make him understand the questions <put by
the parties. Please simplify the question so that he can
understand the main content of the question>. Otherwise, he
cannot give his answer correctly.
Do you understand that?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Yes, I understand that, Mr. President. I will try to make him
understand the -- understand the question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
<Thank you,> Mr. Co-Prosecutor, you may now resume your
questioning.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Thank you.
Q. Once more, I will not dwell on the situation that was
prevalent in your Ou Dambang Muoy cooperative, but rather on what
Ros Nhim may have said regarding the enemies, <or whom he
described as enemies --> government soldiers and senior officials
of the former regime as the enemy? My question is whether you
heard Ros Nhim talk about this during meetings and conversations
with you.
Did he talk about the enemies?
MS LY NIMOL:
The question is that when you met Ros Nhim, did Ros Nhim say that
other officials were enemies. Did he say that?
2-TCW-920:
No. He <told> those people <to adjust their living with us, obey
us and follow us, and not to oppose us, so he let them> live
peacefully. <Several regimes had passed that we killed each
other. If we continued the killing, there would be no one left.
But> at some locations, they killed each other, but not at my
location. In the areas to the east, Sector Number 4, they killed
people. <This resulted from the retaliation of the old regime
when> people <were forced to build forts or posts there. Then the
regime changed, so> they executed each other. <But, there was no
such thing in my location.>
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is that, did you hear anything that Ros Nhim said in
the meetings, particularly about the fact that measures needed to
<single out revolutionary> enemies, <in particular>, those who
were former Lon Nol soldiers and Lon Nol officials? <And the
measure of smashing these enemies?> Did Ros Nhim ever talk about
that?
2-TCW-920:
No, he did not say anything like that. He said that as long as
they could accommodate themselves and live with us peaceful --
live with us, they could live peacefully. <People held different
positions in different regimes. If we were busy to consider this
person held this position, that person held that position, there
would be endless killing. Then, no one would be left alive.>
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Mr. Co-Prosecutor, you may now resume your questioning.
I have recalled and reminded parties that questions should be
short and simple. Please, do not give your prior description
before the questions put to the witness <that caused him the
confusion>.
Keep the questions short and simple.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Witness, regarding the enemies of the regime, <could any>
person in the Northwest Zone who did not follow the discipline or
the policies of Angkar in terms of collectivization, for example
-- could they be considered as enemies?
2-TCW-920:
A. As long as they could conduct themselves and not to oppose us,
then they would be considered as ordinary civilians. And here,
I'm speaking only about my area.
MS. LY NIMOL:
The question is -- do you understand the question?
2-TCW-920:
Later on, the northwest people were accused of being traitors by
the southwest, that is, when the southwest group arrived. <The
northwest people were removed and replaced by the southwest.>
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Fine. My question was more general; it was not focused on
those who accepted the discipline or the orders of Angkar, I was
focusing on people who opposed Angkar, whether it'd be in your
sector, or <more> generally speaking, in other sectors of the
Northwest Zone.
What would happen to those who would oppose and reject Angkar's
orders and discipline?
2-TCW-920:
A. I cannot say about other areas, but I can only say about my
area.
MS. LY NIMOL:
In your area if people didn't obey the discipline, were measures
taken against them, that is, in your area?
2-TCW-920:
A. No. Even for the former Lon Nol soldiers, as long as they
followed us, they would be safe. As long as they did not oppose
us, we would protect them<, so they could survive>.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. I would like to turn to <a few> very specific cases. What
happened to Ta Hoeun (phonetic) under the DK regime? And who was
in charge of his situation?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Do you understand the question? Do you recall Ta Hoeun?
2-TCW-920:
A. Ta Hoeun was a district committee.
MS. LY NIMOL:
And what happened to Ta Hoeun during the regime?
2-TCW-920:
A. Later on, Ta Hoeun was removed. He <was> not <allowed to> work
there anymore.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Witness, do you know if he was withdrawn, as you said, before
the arrest of Ros Nhim or after that?
2-TCW-920:
A. He was removed -- he was removed before <> Ros Nhim.
Q. What was Hoeun (phonetic) accused of by Ros Nhim?
A. His activities were suspicious and that happened because of
the mistrust of one another and, for that reason, he was removed.
Q. Do you know where Ros Nhim sent Hoeun (phonetic) to?
A. Ta Hoeun was removed and I did not know where he was sent to;
he simply disappeared.
Q. At answer 10 of your WRI, E3/9473, you said, "Ros Nhim
arrested Ta Hoeun (phonetic) at the beginning of 1978, <without a
doubt>." And you said that, "After the visit of the Chinese
delegation, Nhim arrested Hoeun (phonetic) after having accused
him of being a CIA agent, and before sending him to Phnom Penh."
End of quote.
So, back then, did you know that Hoeun (phonetic) had been sent
to Phnom Penh?
A. Ta Hoeun was removed and then he disappeared. I did not know
where he was sent to.
Q. Did you ever hear during meetings Ros Nhim or other cadres say
that Ta Hoeun (phonetic) had betrayed the revolution?
A. I did not hear that; I only knew that he was removed and
disappeared.
Q. Earlier, you also spoke about Ta Chham, C-H-H-A-M, who was the
leader of Sector 3. What happened to Ta Chham under the DK
regime? Did he disappear as well?
A. Later on, Ta Chham was removed and disappeared as well and I
did not know where he was sent to.
Q. Was Ta Chham arrested before or after Ros Nhim was arrested?
A. Ta Chham was arrested before Ros Nhim; he disappeared and I
did not know where he went to.
Q. Can you tell us if Ta Chham also acted as a leader in the
Kamping Puoy dam construction?
A. Regarding Kamping Puoy dam, people were <selected> from
various cooperatives.
MS. LY NIMOL:
Did Ta Chham have his supervisory role in that area?
2-TCW-920:
A. No, because people were selected from various communes to
build that dam. <People were selected from seven communes as a
mobile force to build that dam.>
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. I have another question regarding a <person> named Ta Ngon,
N-G-O-N. Did you know this Ta Ngon, who, apparently, had some
leadership position in the zone army?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Do you recall Ta Ngon who was a military at the zone level?
2-TCW-920:
A. I do not recall any person by this name, Ta Ngon.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. I'm not speaking about Ta Moun (phonetic); I'm speaking about
Ta Ngon, N-G-O-N in French. Maybe <also> N-G-O-A-N. I'm going to
read what you said to DC-Cam, so it's document E3/9084, <in>
French <on> pages 40-41; and the English draft, ; and in
Khmer, 00057676 to 677.
"Ta Ngon, N-G-O-N, well, I knew him, but he had climbed the
ranks. He became a division leader. Ta Ngon had two female
messengers, young girls, who were in charge of massaging him.
That's all that I knew. I said to myself that Ta Ngon was not
going to come out alive. He was not going to survive. His
lifestyle led him to betrayal and they called in Ta Ngon and they
<sent him to> the firing squad. He could not escape that."
Question: "Was it Ta Nhim <who shot him>?"
And you answered: "Yes. Ta Nhim <shot him. There> was no point
sparing him even if he was a division commander."
Question: "So therefore, he died in 1975?"
Answer: "Yes, he died in 1975."
And later on you specified that it was rather towards the end of
1975.
So, regarding this Ta Ngon, why did you say to DC-Cam that it was
not worth it to spare him? Was it because he <had acted> at odds
with the Party discipline or was it for any other reason?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Do you recall Ta Ngon?
2-TCW-920:
A. Which Ngon? I don't remember this person; I do not know Ta
Ngon.
MR. KOPPE:
Maybe it's a translation issue, but I heard the Prosecution say
that he was a division commander. And in English, he's been
described as a unit chief. So I don't know maybe in French it's
different, but in English, it says "unit chief". That is very
much more low ranking than a division commander, which is the
highest military position.
MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Well, in any case, I believe that the English draft was not
translated by a professional translator, so I don't believe that
we can rely on the English translation because it's only a draft,
but of course, this needs to be confirmed. But I am going to move
ahead.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Deputy Co-Prosecutor, please give me the exact Khmer ERN number
<to make this clear.>
MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Yes, 00057676; that's where, I believe, his position is
described. And the rest of the quote continues on to the
following page.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What about the national staff; could you please verify the Khmer
ERN? Because I cannot locate it.
MR. PICH ANG:
Mr. President, it's in document E3/9084; ERN is at 00057676. The
name, Ta Ngon, was mentioned and that he rose to become <a>
divisional commander.
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
It is now convenient time for a short break and the Chamber will
take a break now and resume at 25 to 11.00 to continue the
proceeding.
And Mr. Witness, it is now recess time and we will resume at 25
to 11.00 to continue our proceedings.
And Ly Nimol, please assist the witness and have him returned to
the same location at 25 to 11.00.
The Court is now in recess.
(Court recesses from 1018H to 1036H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Court is now back in session.
And Mr. Witness, are you ready?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Are you ready?
2-TCW-920:
I am ready.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
And I'd like to hand the floor again to the International Deputy
Co-Prosecutor to put further questions to the witness.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Thank you, Mr. President.
Q. A while ago, Witness, we talked of the arrest of Hoeun
(phonetic), Chham and also <Ngon, whom> you didn't recall any
more.
Before those high-ranking cadres were arrested did Ros Nhim carry
out his own investigations?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Before somebody was arrested, did Ros Nhim undertake any
investigation?
2-TCW-920:
He would see who did right or who did wrong, and if somebody did
wrong, the person would be removed.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
I did not hear the witness' answer, Mr. President.
Q. So my question was whether Ros <Nhim> carried out his own
investigations before arresting cadres such as Ta Chham, Ta Hoeun
(phonetic), Ta Ngon, and others.
MS. GUISSE:
I do not know whether you have a problem in your ear sets, but we
-- there is a hum in the ear sets, and we didn't hear the
witness' answer.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
My equipment didn't have any battery, so I'm going to have to ask
my colleague what the witness said.
Q. Witness, do you know whether Ros Nhim sometimes received
orders <or> instructions from the upper echelon with a view to
arresting cadres?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Did you know that Ros Nhim received instructions or orders from
upper level for arresting someone?
<2-TCW-920:>
<A. No -->
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please hold on, Witness.
And Defence Counsel Koppe, you have the floor.
MR. KOPPE:
Yes, Mr. President. I keep objecting to this kind of question.
Ros Nhim was upper echelon, so either it has to be very concrete
as to who was ordering him, if at all it was possible for Ros
Nhim to be ordered.
JUDGE FENZ:
It would appear, counsel, we have had the debate yesterday, the
same discussion yesterday.
MR. KOPPE:
But what does "upper echelon" mean when it comes to Ros Nhim? I
don't know.
JUDGE FENZ:
Well, why don't we wait for the answer?
MR. KOPPE:
Yes, but --
JUDGE FENZ:
We can plead later. I know we come close to pleadings, but --
MR. KOPPE:
Upper echelon is not --
JUDGE FENZ:
-- not yet.
MR. KOPPE:
There's upper echelon, there's -- it's not like -- it's not a
person. I mean, there needs to be a person who's ordering. It's
not like it's a machine or something. What is the "upper echelon"
here?
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Witness, do you know whether Ros Nhim sometimes received
orders or instructions from Phnom Penh and, in particular, from
Pol Pot or Nuon Chea, for the purpose of arresting cadres in his
zone?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Do you understand the question, Mr. Witness?
2-TCW-920:
A. He supervised that area, and if somebody did not do <well>,
the person would be removed.
MS. LY NIMOL:
Did you know if Ros Nhim received an order from Pol Pot or Nuon
Chea for the purpose of arresting someone?
2-TCW-920:
I did not have a full grasp regarding this matter.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Witness, did you know, <or were you> able to learn <under> the
regime, whether the cadres who were arrested were prompted to
denounce other cadres?
2-TCW-920:
A. I did not know about that. Probably no, there was no such
cases.
Q. I do not know whether you recall what you said earlier. I'll
read out to you an <excerpt, and there are a few,> it is DC-Cam
statement E3/10762, pages <14 to> 15 in <English>, and in Khmer,
00923746 and 47. There is no French translation. I'll quote it in
English:
"And to my thinking, the purges were the result of the
implications by torture inflicted, interrogations which were
supposed to be expeditious. For example, I'm arrested and you are
traitor, but I have to get you involved through my implication."
Then a little further down:
"I would just put all the names of my colleagues to survive the
torture. When torture is severely inflicted, we just implicate
others, and such implications would become perceived as true. For
this reason, so many people were killed. As in the case of the
arrest of the zone chief, you can see how many people he
implicated through his confession.
"For example, I'm an innocent person, but when I'm implicated, I
will eventually become his affiliate."
And then at page English, 010668800 - 6800; Khmer, 00923747; you
also said the following. I quote:
"I believed, and it was true, that it was a process carried out
in Phnom Penh at that time, which killed tens of thousands of
people through the arrests of the whole link or affiliates,
including the innocent. Believe me, it was true." End of quote.
Did you learn at the time that, indeed, <if> such a process of
torture followed by denunciations occurred in Phnom Penh?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, please hold on.
And Counsel Koppe, you have the floor.
MR. KOPPE:
The witness has been read something back, which is an opinion,
which he was thinking. Witnesses can only testify as to what they
know, what they saw, what they personally experienced, so to put
back before him a quote of -- from his own testimony implicating
what he was thinking must have happened is asking for
speculation.
JUDGE FENZ:
Sorry, counsel. It's something he, himself, said at the time. We
have frequently confronted witnesses or civil parties what they
have said previously. Where is this suddenly coming from?
MR. KOPPE:
Well, then don't bother giving the instructions to the witnesses
any more that he can only testify as to what he saw, experienced,
heard, etc. Then forget about that instruction as well.
JUDGE FENZ:
No, sorry, counsel. We have -- as I said, we have heard frequent
-- this is the practice for two years, which we have allowed for
everybody, and you have done it plenty of times.
Having said that, nobody hinders us to clarify with the witness
if this is an opinion, if this is something he had experienced
himself, and we will then deal with this in the verdict.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
My question, <Your Honour>, was that whether he knew at that time
<that> there was a process of torture <and> denunciations in
place in Phnom Penh at the time.
He can say <whether> he knows about that, or not.
Q. Witness, did you know whether, between 1975 and 1979, people
were brought to Phnom Penh, tortured and <whether> those persons
implicated other persons, entire networks, for instance?
Was that something you were aware of at the time or, from what I
have read, that was something you only got to know subsequently,
after 1979?
2-TCW-920:
A. I did not know about that.
MS. LY NIMOL:
The question is: Between '75 to '79, were tortures inflicted upon
those who were brought to Phnom Penh, <> so that they could <get
the> confession; were they tortured?
2-TCW-920:
A. I did not know anything about that. <That is far beyond my
knowledge.>
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, please hold on and Counsel Kong Sam Onn, you have the
floor.
MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Thank you, Mr. President. The witness actually answered the
question, so please, the facilitator should not intervene <while
the witness is giving his answer;> and she should only intervene
when <> the question <is out of line, and when the question
appears unintelligible>. So please, Mr. President, give
instruction to her.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Thank you, Mr. President. I am afraid that with all these
interruptions, <I'm taking> up too much time, coupled with the
technical difficulties. I'll try to press on.
Q. I'll have you react to what you told DC-Cam. It is a very
short statement in document E3/9084, on  in French, 97 in
English, and I believe that in Khmer, it is 00057713. And this is
what you stated regarding persons who were arrested and I quote:
"If someone were arrested, that necessarily meant that the person
had betrayed; that person, therefore, had to be executed. I was
not in agreement <with that> because I knew <the person could
have been pushed to> speak by <being beaten> or <having their
nails pulled out>. No one could endure such torture. You were
obliged to confess according to what they were expecting of you."
End of quote.
When you stated that when someone was arrested that necessarily
meant that the person had betrayed and that person, therefore,
had to be executed.
My question to you is as follows: When Angkar arrested someone,
was Angkar always assumed to be always right?
2-TCW-920:
A. People would be monitored and if they were found out, then --
if they were found out as traitors, they would be arrested.
However, there was no arbitrary arrest; they had to be monitored.
And before someone was accused <or arrested>, the person would be
monitored, that is, in term of his activities.
Q. A while ago, we talked of some cadres <from> Sector 3, who had
been arrested and who disappeared; can you tell us whether the
leaders of Sector 1 were also arrested by Ros Nhim?
A. No, there was none.
Q. When you were interviewed by DC-Cam; document E3/9084 on page
44 in French, 60 in English, and in Khmer, 00057680, you
mentioned that <Ta> Say (phonetic) was the chief of Sector 1. And
after him <they brought in the one who was there earlier. Dany
asked you> the following: "Ta Vanh?", <V-A-N-H>, and your answer
was, "Ta Vanh, and then the people of the Southwest Zone
arrived". End of quote.
Now, did you know a certain Ta Vanh and do you know whether he
survived the regime?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Is Ta Vanh alive; did he survive the Khmer Rouge regime?
2-TCW-920:
A. Which Ta Vanh and in which sector he was in? I do not recall
the person.
MR. PRESIDENT:
<International> Deputy Co-Prosecutor, you should put the first
question to him, whether he knows Ta Vanh<. In case, he knows Ta
Vanh, you can> go to the <next question. We noted this morning
that you put such questions but you did not first ask about the
familiarity of the person in questions>, then <> it's going to
cause other problems.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Precisely, I believe that he <remembered, at least> at the time
when he was interviewed by DC-Cam <because> he <himself> was the
one who mentioned his name.
Q. Witness, I'm talking of Sector 1; did you know Ta Vanh,
V-A-N-H, Secretary of Sector 1? Can <you> tell us what happened
to him?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Ta Vanh was secretary of Sector 1; do you recall <this>?
2-TCW-920:
A. No, I do not recall him. <There was only Sector 3. At my side,
we were assigned> to Sector 3 <at the commune office.>
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. The question was not whether you went to Sector 3. All I did
was to read out to you a statement you gave to DC-Cam in which
you mentioned the name of Ta Vanh, who had replaced Ta Say
(phonetic) as <head> of Sector 1. Do you recall that?
2-TCW-920:
A. No, I do not recall that. I forget about it.
Q. For the record <I will mention> two documents, E3/2285, which
is an S-21 list titled "Names of Prisoners Smashed on the 18th of
October 1977" and the page in English is 00873644; in Khmer,
00009307; and there is no French version. We find number 122;
that is the name of Chea Huon, H-U-O-N, alias Vanh, V-A-N-H,
secretary of Sector 1, who entered S-21 on the 20th of June 1977
and executed on the 18th of October 1977.
Witness, do you remember the leaders of Sector 2 and do you know
whether some of them <may have been> arrested at the time when
Ros Nhim was the chief of the Northwest Zone?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Do you understand the question, Mr. Witness?
2-TCW-920:
A. I do not recall that. I forget about it and, at that time, I
did not have any work relationship with them; I only worked in my
area leading people to work <> in the rice fields. <We did not
mind others' affairs.>
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Very well, you state that you have forgotten. So to refresh
your memory and to see whether you recall that, does the name
Ren, R-E-N; his full name Srae Oeun (phonetic) alias Ren, ring a
bell to you?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Do you know <Srey> Oeun (phonetic) alias Ren? <Do you know this
name?>
2-TCW-920:
A. No, I do not know this person because I <had no supervisory
role over that person. I only minded my own work>.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Well, fine. Closer to you, I'm going to read out certain names
of people -- of cadres in Sector 3, where you were working. Did
you ever heard about a so-<called> Kou; K-O-U, that is, who was
the deputy secretary of Sector 3?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Kou, the deputy secretary of Sector 3, are you familiar with this
person?
2-TCW-902:
A. No, I did not.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
A. Do you know a <so-called> Hea, H-E-A or H-E-A-R; who was the
secretary of Phnum Sampov district, at one point in time?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Hea, the name is Hea; did you hear of the name Hea, who was the
secretary of Phnum Sampov?
2-TCW-920:
A. I have never met him and I have never heard of that name.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Did you ever hear the name of Chan Oeun, who was the secretary
of Mongkol Borei district?
2-TCW-920:
A. No, I did not. I was trying my best to perform my tasks at my
location, not the tasks at other location in charge by other
people.
Q. Well, I'm not going to continue with this list, but for the
record, we have on the case file the confessions of Kou, who was
the deputy secretary of Region 3; E3/7372, Hea's confessions,
district secretary of Phnum Sampov; E3/7359, as well as the
confessions; E3/7353, of Chan Oeun, who was the district
secretary in Mongkol Borei district. All of their three
confessions date back to the beginning of 1978; that is to say,
before the arrest of Ros Nhim.
Witness, do you know if leaders in Sector
were arrested by Ros  
          4   Nhim because of the situation in that sector?
MS LY NIMOL:
Do you hear the question? <Please repeat the question.>
2-TCW-920:
A. I do not have any ideas about that issue since I was working
at my location<. As for other locations, I did not grasp the
situation>.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. I'm aware of that, Witness, but I simply would like to read
out what you said to DC-Cam; that is statement E3/9084, regarding
the leaders of Sector 4. In Khmer, it's at , <in
French> on  and in English, in the draft, on .
So listen carefully to what you said previously, and I quote:
"In the regional committee of Sector 4, there was Ta Vouch,
V-O-U-C-H; Ta Suy, S-U-Y; and, later, when they arrested Suy,
only Vouch remained as well as Heang, H-E-A-N-G. Later on, they
arrested Vouch and Heang; it was really a mess." End of quote.
So do you remember the so-<called>Ta Suy in Sector 4, as well as
Ta Heang?
2-TCW-920:
A. I can recall the name Suy, but I did not see <the person. They
looked for these two persons for the arrest>. I do not know where
their whereabouts; we separated from one another. Ta <Suy> was
from the same location where I was from<, that was Srok Leu
(phonetic) or upper district>.
Q. In the same statement, E3/9084; in French on ;
English, in the draft, ; and in Khmer, 00057692; you said
that you reported to <Ta Nhim --> Ros Nhim that the people in
Sector 4 were dying of hunger and I quote:
"Afterwards, then he knew and so he went to investigate the
situation. That was the reality in the field. Later on, the
sector <and commune> chiefs were arrested <one after another."
Then it says:> "He started by arresting Suy, S-U-Y, who
disappeared before everyone else. He arrested Suy and then he
arrested the people in Sector 4: Ta Vouch and Ta Heang. After the
arrests, they arrested Vong, V-O-N-G. He was able to resist
arrest for a few months, but then he was arrested in the end."
End of quote.
This is what you stated a few years ago, about 10 years ago, to
DC-Cam; do you remember that; do you remember that Ros Nhim
arrested Suy and then arrested a whole series of cadres <from>
Sector 4?
A. I cannot recall the statement that I gave to the DC-Cam. I was
located in my area and I never went to other locations under
those people's responsibilities. <I did not go and monitor the
situation at those locations.>
Q. For the record, we have on list E3/2285, at English, page
00873637; Khmer, 00009304; so this is an S-21 list entitled, "The
Name of the Prisoners who were Smashed on 18 October 1977".
So, these are the people who also entered S-21 in July 1977 and
at number 34 on this list, we can see Suy, S-U-Y. His full name
was Sun Kun alias Suy; he was the deputy secretary of Sector 4.
And we also see Heang, H-E-A-N-G, who was mentioned by the
witness before DC-Cam, who was the secretary of Sector 4 who
entered S-21 on
March 1978. This is document E3/1942; English, 
          13   00183855; French, 00870455; and Khmer, 00040024.
So, Witness, please bear with me. In Sector 5, did you know the
secretary of Sector 5 who was called Hoeng, H-O-E-N-G?
<A. Who was in Sector 5?>
MS. LY NIMOL:
Hoeng, in Sector number 5 -- Hoeng, Sector number 5, do you
recall that person?
2-TCW-920:
A. <> Hoeng was gone; I do not know where he went. I know a
Hoeng; he <ran away>.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEAL:
Q. Did you know his deputy? You said to DC-Cam that this person
was called Chhnang, C-H-H-N-A-N-G.
A. Chhnang, the child of Ros?
Q. Yes, indeed, Ros Nhim's child; was his name Chhnang and what
was his position in Sector
<alongside> Hoeng? 
           5   MS. LY NIMOL:
Chhnang worked at Sector Number 5; was he <> the deputy chief <or
what>?
2-TCW-920:
A. Chhnang was the child of Ros Nhim.
MS. LY NIMOL:
He worked at Sector 5; what was his position?
2-TCW-920:
A. That person was the child of So Phim and So Phim and Ros Nhim
were in-law.
MS. LY NIMOL:
What was his position, Chhnang's position?
2-TCW-920:
A. <That time,> he was quite young. <He was not assigned to do
anything yet.> Chhnang got married with the child of So Phim and
the two: Ros Nhim and So Phim were in-laws.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Fine. With the leave of the President, I'd like the person from
WESU not to put questions to the witness that I did not put to
him, <if you can,> but thanks, anyway, for the information.
Q. Do you know, Witness, what happened to the chief of Region 5,
Ta Hoeng; was he among the people who were arrested by Ros Nhim?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I <too> do not really understand. Now, you want to ask me to tell
the staff member there to stop intervene while you -- while you
are asking questions, so could you please clarify this for me?
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
No, no, Mr. President. That's not what I was talking about. It's
just that, <just> before, the staff person from WESU asked for
the age of Ros Nhim's son and if he was married etc.; these are
questions that I did not put to the witness, so I would like her
not to put additional questions to the questions that I am
putting to the witness.
Q. But I simply would like to put my question again to the
witness, with your leave; that is to say, what happened to Ta
Hoeng; that is to say, the leader of <Sector> 5, was he among the
people who were arrested by Ros Nhim?
MR. KOPPE:
Mr. President, the question has been asked already a few times in
this forum, but I'm objecting now anyway. Why would any of the
(inaudible) members be arrested by Ros Nhim? They could be
arrested by any -- by anyone, if we don't know, so I think the
question should be formulated neutrally: Was he -- was he
arrested and if yes, by whom?
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Well, let me rephrase the question, Witness. So was Ta Hoeng
arrested when Ros Nhim was the secretary of the Northwest Zone?
(Short pause)
<MR. MAM RITHEA:>
<The witness cannot get the question. He requests the question be
asked again.>
MR. PRESIDENT:
Deputy Co-Prosecutor, could you put the question again?
Nimol, please assist the witness. Try to make the witness
understand the question, but do not add other questions to the
one put by the Co-Prosecutor and you can take note of the
question asked, so that the question is exactly what the party
asks.
Co-Prosecutor, could you repeat your last question?
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. In Sector 5, was Ta Hoeng arrested when Ros Nhim was the chief
of the Northwest Zone?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Did Ros Nhim arrest Ta -- could you repeat the question, Mr.
Co-Prosecutor, because I could not get it?
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Of course, my question was very simple in fact. We were
speaking about Sector 5 and about its chief, Ta Hoeng; was Ta
Hoeng, H-O-E-N-G, arrested when Ros Nhim was still the secretary
of the Northwest Zone?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Was Ta Hoeng arrested?
2-TCW-920:
A. <That time, Ta Ros Nhim was still in the Northwest and he
removed> Hoeng < >.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Well, we see on the case file, among other documents, the
confessions of Men Chun alias Hoeng, who was the secretary of
Sector 5, and this is at E3/2474 and at E3/1558.
And now, I'd like to turn witness to the arrest of Ros Nhim; what
do you know about the arrest of Ros Nhim?
2-TCW-920:
A. Ros Nhim was arrested by the southwest. Southwest arrested Ros
Nhim because it was said that Ros Nhim joined hands with the
"Yuon", so the southwest arrested him.
Q. When you're speaking about the southwest, could you speak
about specific people who then had some kind of position in the
Northwest Zone?
A. The southwest arrived after Ta Mok and Ta Tith. In fact, these
people came and arrested former people in the northwest.
Q. (Microphone not activated)
<MS. GUISSE:>
Your mic is not activated.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Thank you.
Q. So you said that Ros Nhim was arrested because he was accused
of being an ally of the "Yuon", so did you attend meetings <or
did> Southwest Zone cadres <tell> you -- provide you with details
regarding this alliance with the "Yuon" or this betrayal?
2-TCW-920:
A. The southwest conducted the arrests and Ros Nhim was arrested
by those people. They accused the <northwest> people <of being
dishonest>.
MS. LY NIMOL:
The question, in fact, is about the meetings, whether or not you
attended a meeting where there was a discussion about <traitors
who joined hands with the Vietnamese?>
2-TCW-920:
A. No, I did not attend any meetings. <I was a lower-rank
person.> I was <tasked to> focus on my work.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. So based on what you might have been told, was Ros Nhim
surprised to be arrested?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Did Ros Nhim feel surprised when people came to arrest him?
2-TCW-920:
A. South -- the Southwest came to arrest Ros Nhim and he brought
to a place where Ros Nhim confessed that he betrayed Angkar. <The
southwest people came to arrest the northwest people.>
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Do you know if -- when he was arrested or on the days<, weeks,
or months> that preceded that arrest, do you know if Ros Nhim
tried to resist the cadres who had come from the Southwest Zone?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Before Ros Nhim was arrested.
2-TCW-920
A. The northwest people were accused of betraying Angkar, so
those people were removed and Ros Nhim was removed and sent to
<Phnom Penh. After the allegation,> Ros Nhim was removed,
together with his family and children <to Phnom Penh to be
executed. His wife lived in Khsach Pouy.>
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. How did you react when you learned that Ros Nhim had been
arrested in Battambang?
2-TCW-920:
A. I did not have any reaction. I was under his command and I did
not know the accusation made by the upper echelon against him.
Q. In your DC-Cam statement, E3/9084, at the draft page in
English, ; pages 22 and 23 in French; and in Khmer,
00057656; it's very short, and you said the following:
"When he died, I regretted it. They killed their own; in fact,
all of the cadres back then died. No one survived."
So why did you regret Ros Nhim, when he was arrested?
A. I regretted it because I did not know how could he betray
Angkar. They accused one another. The southwest accused the
northwest <of betraying> Angkar and they arrested those people.
Then I was removed to be stationed at <Snoeng>. First, I was
placed in Ou Dambang; then I was removed to <Snoeng>.
Q. In all of your dealings with Ros Nhim, back then during the DK
period, were you <ever> able to perceive, at one point in time,
something that might have led you to think that Ros Nhim wasn't
loyal to the CPK?
A. The southwest accused that Ros Nhim betrayed.
MS. LY NIMOL:
Witness, did you observe, personally, that Ros Nhim betrayed
Angkar?
2-TCW-920:
A. <I observed that> he did not commit any mistakes and the
southwest, in fact, accused the northwest of betrayal; those
southwest people came to arrest the northwest people. So in fact,
we arrested each other.
MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. President. I am aware that my time is running out
and the civil parties will need five to 10 minutes and I still
have a few questions to put, so I'd like to know if I could
continue until a quarter to 12.00 <this morning>?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, time is not added for you and if the Co-Lead Lawyers for
civil party have questions, they can now have the floor.
MR. PICH ANG:
Mr. President, I would like to give my time to the Deputy
Co-Prosecutor.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you may now proceed, Co-Prosecutor.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Well, I'm going to try to finish as quickly as possible and I
will speak about the purges in the Northwest Zone after the
arrest of Ros Nhim because we have enough elements on the case
file.
So I'd like to get back to what Nuon Chea said regarding Ros
Nhim's death because he said that he did not regret it, <like
you,> and this appears <in the book> E3/4202. This is Gina Chon
and Thet Sambath's book, which is called, "Behind the Killing
Fields"; in English, 00757530; in French, 00849433; and Khmer,
00858336. And I'm going to quote in English because that is the
original language of the book.
"Among the accused were Vorn Vet, Koy Thuon, and Northwest Zone
secretary, Ros Nhim. After decades of living as brothers fighting
against a common enemy, they were now deemed traitors. 'We never
accused any top leader without evidence and witnesses,' Nuon Chea
said."
And Nuon Chea continues: "We knew clearly about their betrayal
and plans to topple the regime and kill innocent people in the
provinces without the Centre's orders and knowledge. Pol Pot had
evidence and witnesses, so he decided to arrest them. I have no
regrets because when I read the confessions, it was very clear
what they were doing."
Next page in English, same ERN, ; French, 00849434;
Khmer, 00858337; I quote:
"Nuon Chea does not deny that these Party members were killed in
purges ordered by the leadership and reiterates that they were
traitors and needed to be smashed."
In fact - quote: "Most of the leaders in the Centre were on
Vietnam's puppet strings." End of quote.
And then  in English; French, 00849435 to 36; Khmer,
00858340; I quote:
"Nuon Chea said he was not particularly disturbed when his former
comrades and friends were executed. 'The Party decided to kill
them because they were betraying the Party and the nation. I was
not scared or sad when they were killed. They had done wrong and
betrayed us, so they received the kind of treatment they
deserved. We were friends, but friendship and political work are
separate'." End of quote of Nuon Chea.
"Nuon Chea went on to explain the difficulties of rooting out
enemies which consumed the Khmer Rouge leadership." End of quote.
I have two questions and then I'll stop there.
Nuon Chea stated that he had read the confessions of those
leaders. He talks of Vorn Vet, Koy Thuon, and Ros Nhim and
according to him, those confessions were clear.
Witness, do you know why the leaders of Democratic Kampuchea
believed in the contents of the confessions of prisoners?
MS. LY NIMOL:
The question is why leaders -- why did the leaders believe in the
prisoners' confessions? <Do you understand this question?>
2-TCW-920:
A. <It depended on those who suppressed and> mistreated him and
forced him to confess. I do not believe that he betrayed. <We
accused each other. Likewise,> the southwest accused that the
northwest betrayed Angkar <by joining hands with others>, so the
southwest <was cleaner and> came to control the northwest. We --
in fact, this was a double-cross by Khmer people. They mistreated
each other. I<, myself was accused of betraying, and> was removed
and reassigned to <Snoeng>. I was under surveillance and they
found nothing about me.
BY MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
Q. Last question: Nuon Chea stated that those leaders had
received the treatment they deserved. Did Ros Nhim -- that you
knew very well in the 1960s and subsequently during Democratic
Kampuchea -- did Ros Nhim deserve the treatment that was meted
out to him, in your opinion, or according to you?
MS. LY NIMOL:
Witness, did you think it was appropriate to do such things
against Ros Nhim?
2-TCW-920:
A. <As I said, that was factional.> The southwest came and
accused northwest <of> betraying; <that the northwest joined
hands with "Yuon". This> happened to our Khmer nation. The
southwest came to purge the northwest<, including Ros Nhim, who
was from the northwest. When> the southwest<, like Ta Mok,> came
<later,> it <appeared> that they were good people.
MR. DE WILDE D'ESTMAEL:
I have no further questions, Mr. President. I thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Deputy Co-Prosecutor.
I am grateful to you, Mr. Witness and I thank you also, Nimol.
The Chamber will take a -- the lunch break from now until 1.30.
Please wait, Witness and Nimol, and perhaps, the defence teams
may not have question.
You may now proceed, Counsel Koppe.
MR. KOPPE:
That was exactly the reason I was rising. I don't think I have
any questions for him. I don't think the Khieu Samphan team
either, so we might as well let him go now.
MS. GUISSE:
To be clear, we, the Khieu Samphan team, do not have any
<further> questions for this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is a very good news. The Chamber is grateful to you, Mr.
Witness. The hearing of your testimony, as a witness, has now
come to a conclusion. The -- your testimony will contribute to
the ascertainment of the truth. You may now be excused. I wish
you good luck, good health, and prosperity.
I thank you also, Mr. Mam Rithea. You may also be excused.
Nimol -- Ly Nimol, WESU staff, and other individuals, the Chamber
-- the Chamber is grateful to you for your coordination and
facilitation in arranging the proceeding and also the technology
or video link for the Chamber.
And in the afternoon, the Chamber will continue hearing the
testimony of Nuon Trech because we have him as a reserve witness.
The Chamber now take a lunch break and we'll resume at 1.30.
Security personnel are instructed to bring Mr. Khieu Samphan to
the waiting room and please have him returned into the courtroom
before 1.30.
The Court is now in recess.
(Court recesses from 1138H to 1334H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Court is now in session.
The Chamber continues hearing the testimony of Nuon Trech. The
floor is given to the defence team for Mr. Nuon Chea to put
questions to <Nuon Trech> and the defence team -- the two defence
teams still have one session today because you have used one
session already <yesterday>.
QUESTIONING BY MR. KOPPE RESUMES:
Thank you, Mr. President.
Mr. Witness, good afternoon. I will -- I will be continuing my
questions from yesterday. Yesterday afternoon when we broke, you
were speaking about -- you were speaking about being in the
prison office that you indicated as being Tuol Sleng prison. Let
me follow up with some questions in respect of your stay there.
Q. In your DC-Cam statement, E3/7537, at English, ERN 00251254;
French, 00291004; and Khmer, 00019647; you said that before you
were brought to this prison office that you were told -- you were
lied to, that they would take you to the international hospital.
Who was it that told you that you would be taken to the
international hospital?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please hold on. You may now proceed, first, Deputy Co-Prosecutor.
MR. LYSAK:
Thank you, Mr. President. My objection is to the initial comment
that led to this question, which was that the witness stated he
was at Tuol Sleng. He was asked about this passing comment in his
DC-Cam interview yesterday, and he clearly said he was not at
Tuol Sleng, but that there were people who were brought to that
office who were later taken to Tuol Sleng.
It's clear from his OCIJ statement, he did not know what office
he was at, so I think counsel should not be leading the witness
or representing that this witness was at Tuol Sleng when he
hasn't even asked -- asked the witness what office he was at.
MR. KOPPE:
Well, I was just rereading the draft transcript from yesterday.
JUDGE FENZ:
And just give us the reference; makes it easier.
MR. KOPPE:
Well, I asked him yesterday about which prison office he thought
it was.
JUDGE FENZ:
Where? Where in the draft transcript?
MR. KOPPE:
At the -- at the very end, at 1600, so that is -- that's
yesterday. And I asked him this question because in his DC-Cam
statement, he clearly says on two occasions that he was in --
that it was the Tuol Sleng prison office. That is on the same
page I was -- as I -- as I just referred to.
Yesterday I asked him how did he know it was the Tuol Sleng
prison office and then he gave another answer. So his answer
yesterday, in combination with his DC-Cam statement, makes me to
understand that the witness is saying that he was at the Tuol
Sleng prison office. So I think my question was justified.
Whether that is really the case; that is ultimately for the
Chamber to decide, but I understand the testimony to be that he
thought that he was, for a few days, being interrogated and
photographed in the Tuol Sleng prison office.
JUDGE FENZ:
So why don't we clarify then?
Witness, is it your understanding that you, for a couple of days,
have been in the S-21 prison office?
MR. KOPPE:
No, at the Tuol Sleng prison; that's what he said.
JUDGE FENZ:
Sorry, I'm sorry; that's true.
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. I was brought to the prison office before we were further sent
to Tuol Sleng. I did not realize, at first, that it was Tuol
Sleng prison, but there was a comrade telling me and others that,
"you are all here; you will be imprisoned". <I realised that I
was imprisoned.>
Later on, this information was learned by my chairman. He came to
rescue me and my chairman<, Yiet,> said that I had nothing to do
with the mistakes leading to an <imprisonment>. My chairman
requested me back so that I could be refashioned. Then if I could
not be refashioned, I would be sent for that prison office.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. So that will bring me back to my initial question, Mr.
Witness. In your DC-Cam statement, on the pages that I just
referred to, you said before you were brought to the prison
office that "They lied to me telling me that they'd taken me to
the international hospital, and I didn't realize either that it
was Tuol Sleng prison office. I thought it was the office of the
international hospital, so I just sat there and waited."
My question to you is: Who told you that you'd be going to the
international hospital office?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. Bong Sralao, and upon my arrival at the prison office, Bong
Sralao was arrested and sent away.
Q. On that same page, you talked about someone who told you that
you were in a prison office and you identify this person as Yiet.
You said, "Then Yiet, the deputy director of the hospital I
worked at, came. He hadn't seen me at work and so he asked
someone about me. He had been told I had been brought here, at
the prison office, by Ol."
Now, let me ask you a question first about Yiet. You identify
Yiet that he was the deputy director of the hospital; are you
sure about that or are you maybe referring to a person who was
chief of logistics of Battalion 314?
A. Yiet was the chief of logistics of Battalion 314. He was my
direct supervisor. I served as a medic. He did not see me, so he
asked Bong Sralao, who was the deputy chief of the logistic. He
asked Sralao, "Where is the comrade; why I don't see him going
around and give injection shots?" He told Yiet that I had been
brought by a vehicle to a place -- to <Ol's> place already and it
was the prison office.
Q. And did Yiet have any form of authority in this prison office
or did he just come in and tell you this; what exactly was the
reason for your chief -- the chief of logistics of Battalion 314
to be there at this prison office?
A. He went to see Ol, the chief of that prison office; he wanted
to take me back for refashioning since I did not commit any
mistakes and he promised to send me back if I could not be
refashioned.
Q. And who was Ol; he was the office -- I think the witness said
something without the microphone.
A. Ol was the chief of the prison office. He was in charge of
forwarding people to the Tuol Sleng.
Q. And how did you know that?
A. It was because Yiet came to see Ol <to make a request. I was
near so> I learned about that information. Yiet -- my chief
wanted to take me back for refashioning; that was the time when I
learned about that.
Q. And did you know Ol before you saw him in that prison office?
A. I saw his face, but I, at the time, did not know <Ol>. Only
when I returned, <Yiet told me> Ol <was> the one who sent people
to Tuol Sleng.
Q. And was Ol, himself, a member of Division 310?
A. It appears that he was not a member of that division; he was
in charge of putting people in chains and then sending them
further.
Q. Some additional questions about this prison office: Can you
recall the inside of that office; can you describe how it looked
like from the inside?
A. There were guards and there were cuffs and shackles. <In
there,> we were prohibited from moving to any other places. Since
we were considered prisoners, we were not allowed to move.
Q. Did you see other prisoners or did you see only fellow
Division 310 combatants or do you remember who you saw inside?
A. The people from my battalion were arrested and sent;
subsequently, <Comrade Seng> (phonetic), <Comrade> Phan
(phonetic), were also sent to the location and they disappeared.
Q. And can you tell us where exactly inside this prison office
your photo was taken? Where was the camera, for instance, that
took your photo?
A. I was not photographed within the compound of Tuol Sleng. The
photo was taken at an office and the photo was shot in order to
be kept -- to be included in the biography. At the time, I did
not know why they took photographs. They wanted the photos so I
allowed them to take my photo. <I could not question because I
was merely a subordinate.>
Q. Do you know whether the people who were in charge of this
prison office belonged to Division 703?
A. The ones who were in charge of that prison mostly were from
the divisions of the southwest. I mean they were from Division
502.
Q. Was it may be called S-22?
A. I am not aware of S-22. I <dared not enter> that place
<because> those <who were sent there, always> disappeared.
MR. KOPPE:
Mr. President, I'll be referring to document E3/5263, which is a
WRI from a witness Sreng Thi who talks about a prison belonging
to Division 502. More specifically, I'll be referring to English,
ERN 0028225; and French, 00283350. Unfortunately, I don't have a
Khmer ERN right now.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. Mr. Witness, I asked you already. You were not able to look
out of the window where you were taken. At the DC-Cam statement -
in your DC-Cam statement you said it was about two to three
kilometres.
This witness that I just referred to speaks about a location
called S-22, located west of the Tuek L'ak school. Does that
sound in any way somehow familiar?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. I cannot recall it. It is 47 years already from that time
until now. I was young at the time and I am getting older now, so
my memory does not serve me well.
Q. Ah, that's fine, Mr. Witness. No problem. Let me move on.
From this prison office, you were subsequently sent to work at
Kampong Chhnang airfield. I will be asking you some questions
about that, but I, first, would like to ask you some questions
about what you did after you left Kampong Chhnang airfield. Where
did you go then?
A. I was removed for refashioning since it was said that I was
part of the traitorous network. I was from the North Zone<. It
was said that people in Division 310 who were from the North Zone
were all traitors. Yiet and other comrades were arrested.>  So I
was <sent> for refashioning in Kampong Chhnang. I was made to dig
dirt at the airfield and <> burned the explosive. I was made to
work from 4 a.m. up until 12 p.m. Then I resumed the work at 1.00
in the afternoon.
Later on, Vietnam attacked that which -- conducted the attack in
1979 and they said that for combats who had already been
refashioned needed to be sent for the resistance movement against
the Vietnamese.
I was in Kampong Chhnang for refashioning for three months. Then
I was some -- brought to engage in a war against Vietnam. They
said that we had a background in combat, <we fought to capture
Phnom Penh>.
They sent us from Kampong Chhnang to Takhmau. We were equipped
with weapons.
We were put in a fast boat <to Tonle Bet> in order to go to
attack the Vietnamese.
Since I was a medic, I was not sent for the combat but I was made
to be a medic <wrapping> wounds for the soldiers.
Q. And when you were sent to the border to be involved in the
fights with Vietnam, which unit were you in? Were you in Unit 4?
A. I do not know which unit I was in. I was made a medic in the
military. I did not have the information which unit I was in.
<We engaged in> fighting at Trapeang Phlong and at Chrak Rumdeng.
<At Trapeang Pring,> I was injured by <a-105 mm> shelling of the
Vietnamese<>; then I was sent to be hospitalized at <Wat Totuem>
(phonetic), near Suong. I was so severely injured so I was
further sent to Phnom Penh.
Q. In your DC-Cam statement, E3/7537; English, ERN 00251258;
French, 00291009; and Khmer, 00019651; you said: "I was
transferred to -- that is, as we were from the Central Zone, we
were transferred to fight in Suong, S-U-O-N-G, in Memot
district."
And a bit further you say -- you talk about Unit 4, so I am not
making Unit 4 up; it's coming from your statement.
And a bit further you said, "I was moved to Suong in Choam
Pring." Is that correct?
A. I was removed from the airfield and sent to the military to
work as a medic wrapping wounds at Memot. I, at the time, did not
know which unit I was in or which battalion I was in. I was
forcibly moved at the time.
Q. What do you mean "forcibly moved", Mr. Witness?
A. They saw that there was an intensified attack by the
Vietnamese so some traitors at the airfield were to be sent to
counter the attack.
<I went but I did not join the combat.> I wrapped wounds for a
soldier -- or soldiers, who were sent to me for treatment. And at
the time, <the soldiers whose wound I wrapped died, and> I got
wounded, severely wounded, and I was hospitalized.
Q. Thank you for the clarification, but I don't understand the
word "forcibly".
You were a Division 310, Battalion 314 soldier at least from 17
April '75 all the way until the end. So if you as a soldier
received an order from your superior, you had to obey it; isn't
it true, certainly because it was war with Vietnam? So I don't
understand the word "forcibly".
A. They said that if we did not go, then the Vietnamese would
enter our Kampuchean territory and as a result, we would not
survive. The Vietnamese would slaughter us <by cutting our
throats with the midrib of palm leaves> and since we were former
soldiers that we used to liberate Phnom Penh, then we were sent
to counter the advancements by the Vietnamese troops.
As for Division 310 <and Division 4>, they were sent there, but I
did not know which unit I was assigned to because I did not see
those soldiers who were in the same unit with me previously.
Q. I understand. Let me try it differently, Mr. Witness.
This is correct that as of the day of the liberation of Phnom
Penh, 17 April '75, until the Vietnamese occupied Cambodia on the
7th of January '79, you had always been a soldier within Division
310; is that correct?
A. After I was wounded, I was hospitalized. So I was no longer
belonging to the division. I spent about two months in a hospital
in Phnom Penh.
Q. Let me ask it more concretely.
While you were at the Kampong Chhnang airfield and before you
went to Suong, were you a member of Division 310?
A. We were not told <that we were> under Division 310 <> because
we were sent in a speedboat and <we mingled with> quite a number
of soldiers who had <former> tendency while we worked at Kampong
Chhnang. So we disembarked at Tonle Bet, then we were put onto a
vehicle.
Q. One last attempt, Mr. Witness.
When you were at Kampong Chhnang airfield, you were there in your
capacity as a Division 310 soldier; correct?
A. At the time, we were under Division 310. But when we were at
the airfield, it seems that we were no longer connected to that
division because that place or worksite was for refashioning us.
Q. Well, how do you know that? Who told you that?
A. I do not understand that.
JUDGE FENZ:
I think you need to clarify who told him what, that he was no
longer under 310, I presume.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. Who told you that while at Kampong Chhnang airfield, you were
somehow no longer considered to be a Division 310 soldier?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. That worksite was for refashioning and tempering and they said
that if people could <not> be refashioned there, then they could
be returned to be imprisoned at Tuol Sleng prison. <Thus, it was
a place for refashioning people.> I did not know the person who
was the chief of that worksite because my main focus was to work
hard and to survive. If I did not try to work hard -- because we
had to wake up at 4 <a.m.>, starting working right away and then
we had to keep working <from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m.> and there was a
meeting at 8.00 at night.
So I did not know who was in charge of the area as everybody was
striving to work hard in order to refashion ourselves. <Everybody
worked to survive.>
Q. I will maybe get back to that, if I have some more time.
Mr. President, I still owe you a Khmer ERN, the reference of the
Sreng Thi WRI. It's 00270179, the reference about the S-21 prison
office.
Mr. Witness, let me revisit the subject that we discussed
yesterday. Yesterday we spoke briefly about a meeting at a school
close to Wat Phnom where a tape was being played and where you
were told about treason committed by Oeun and Koy Thuon.
Yesterday at around 15.47, you said that at a meeting were
comrades from Battalion 314.
Were there also members of other battalions during that meeting,
Battalion, for instance, 306, Battalion 307 or regiments?
Are you in a position to tell us that?
A. When they held a meeting at the school to the north of Wat
Phnom, all battalion members came. However, I only knew those
members of Battalion 314, which was a logistics battalion.
There were many other people from various other battalions and
through loudspeaker, they broadcast <> the confession of Koy
Thuon and <my> division commander, <Oeun and brother Voeun,> the
deputy <commander of the division>. They said that our commanders
were traitors and people from the Central Zone were also
traitors, and for that reason, we had to refashion ourselves.
Otherwise, we would be subject to being arrested.
Q. But just to be sure, you don't know anyone or you didn't know
anyone specifically from any battalion, such as Battalion 306 or
307; correct?
A. No, I did not know those battalions. I only knew members of my
own battalion, that is, those who worked for the logistics
battalion.
Q. You said that at the meeting plans of rebellion by Oeun and
Koy Thuon were discussed. You didn't know many details when I
asked you yesterday.
Was it the first time that you heard anything about a rebellion
or a planned coup d'etats or a plan to topple Pol Pot at that
meeting or did you hear anything or did you see anything before
that meeting?
A. I only heard that the new commander of Division 310 said that
Oeun and those in the Central or the North Zones planned to
attack Phnom Penh. And that was the first time I heard it in that
meeting. <I did not know this prior to that time.>
Q. So before that, you, yourself, didn't observe any activity
either in your own battalion or in other battalions or regiments
that would be considered as acts of rebellion or preparatory acts
for a coup d'etats?
A. I did not know about that. I was a subordinate and I was
assigned to be a medic to treat the wounded soldiers. <I had to
treat people at varied locations.>
Q. Well, let me be concrete. Yesterday, you spoke about the TV
antenna at Tuol Kork, close to which you were stationed. At
15.45, you also mentioned the radio station at Stueng Mean Chey.
Before this meeting, did you ever hear about plans within
Division 310 to attack the radio station and take over the radio
station at Stueng Mean Chey?
A. No, I did not hear anything about that. If the matters were
discussed amongst the commanders, then I would not know.
Q. Well, the person who was saying this wasn't really a
commander, but he was a low-ranking soldier who was also sent to
Kampong Chhnang airfield, just as yourself, and he testified in
this courtroom on the 23rd of June 2015 at 9.11 in the morning.
He said that there was a plan to attack the radio station at
Stueng Mean Chey; simultaneously to attack Pochentong airport.
And that's what he says: the ultimate aim was to conduct a coup
d'états.
There were quite some other low-ranking Division 310 soldiers who
were saying similar things. I'd be happy to read them to you.
But isn't there anything that you knew before that meeting that
we discussed yesterday and today?
A. No, I did not know about that. When I was a medic in the
battalion, I only concentrated on my work. I was afraid that they
said <> I did not do my work properly or would accuse me of being
an enemy. And for that reason, I kept working hard and not to
make any mistake.
Q. Did you know anything before that meeting about warehouses
where ammunition was stored?
A. I did not know about that.
Q. Well, let me conclude then with one general statement from
that same witness who testified here and to see if that somehow
jogs your memory.
This is at 23 June again at 9.15 in the morning and Sem Hoeurn,
who is from Division 307, sorry, Battalion 307, he said in Court
and I quote: "Let me clarify the rebellion plan. There was So
Phim in the East Zone and Ta Koy Thuon in the North Zone. They
already prepared the forces in the front line and at the rear.
The army of the Centre was prepared for the front line, the plan
to attack Phnom Penh. The sector forces were to attack behind at
the sector level." End of quote.
Is that something, Mr. Witness, that somehow jogs your memory?
A. No, it doesn't jog my memory. It happened a long time ago.
Q. Then a final question: In your DC-Cam statement when you speak
about your time at the front battlefield with the Vietnamese that
your unit or that you were afraid that, "the 'Yuon' would slit
our throat", that is, English, ERN 00251258; French, 00291010;
and Khmer, 00019651.
"No. We tried to walk by ourselves. If we stayed the 'Yuon' would
slit our throats."
Why was it that your unit was afraid that your throats would be
slit by the "Yuon"?
A. At that time, the soldiers were still fighting<, when soldiers
got> wounded, I <wrapped their wounds. These soldiers engaged in
the fight against the Vietnamese>. They warned us that if
Vietnamese entered Kampuchean territory, then we would be
slaughtered.
So I was there at the front battlefield but I was not fighting
against the Vietnamese but I was treating the wounded. <I worked
as a medic.> Later on, as I said, I was wounded by a shell.
Q. But was that fear based upon experiences in the past or do you
know what the source was for this fear that the "Yuon" would slit
the throats of you and others once you would be captured?
A. I did not know at the time<. After> I was wounded, <I did not
know whether they fled or not.>
However, before that they were fighting against the Vietnamese at
Trapeang Phlong (phonetic) and at Chrak Rumdeng, and later on, I
did not know about their fate because I was being hospitalized.
Q. But in your experience as a medic, did you encounter ever
fellow combatants whose throats had been slit by Vietnamese
troops?
A. No, it did not. That could be the policy on the Khmer Rouge
side so that we would hold <bitterness against> the Vietnamese
and fight against them.
So those soldiers, they were afraid, and for that reason they
tried harder to fight against the Vietnamese.
MR. KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
And the floor is given to the Co-Prosecutors to put questions to
this witness.
QUESTIONING BY MR. LYSAK:
Thank you, Mr. President.
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. I'll be asking you some questions on
behalf of the Co-Prosecutors.
And with your leave, Mr. President, I'd like to start by
presenting to the witness a document that's part of his DC-Cam
records. This is in Khmer only. It's a DK biography, E3/7537,
pages Khmer, 00019461 through 468.
May I provide this to the witness?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. Mr. Witness, can you look at this document? First, are you
able to read and if so, can you tell me whether this is a
biography that you prepared during the Khmer Rouge regime?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. Yes, I can read and that is the biography that was made during
the Khmer Rouge regime. In order to join the revolutionary
movement, everyone had to make our own biography.
Q. And the first and second pages of this biography identify you
as a medic in Company 2 of Battalion 314 of Division 310, and
also indicates that you were 21 years old at the time of this
biography.
Would it be correct then that this biography was prepared
sometime in 1976 after you had joined, after you had left P-99
hospital and joined Battalion 314?
A. I cannot recall as to when I was -- I made that biography. We
were asked to make our biography. <I cannot recall it.>
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness.
I want to turn now to the meeting that you've described already
that you attended at the school north of Wat Phnom at which you
and other Division 310 cadres were informed of the arrest of
division secretary Oeun and you heard a tape recording of his
confession played over a loud speaker.
Can you tell us who presided this meeting at which this
recording, tape recording of Division 310 Commander Oeun was
played? Who spoke and who presided at that meeting?
A. After Oeun and others had been arrested, they brought in
people from the southwest group and I did not know them. I did
not know the names of the new commander. They said that Division
310 and some others in the North Zone were traitors. And for that
reason, we had to refashion ourselves to be good because our
commanders were traitors. I do not recall their names.
Q. Let me see if I can refresh your memory. In your OCIJ
interview which was a number of years ago, this is document
E3/7877; Khmer, ERN 00342436; French, 00411784; English,
00346978; this is what you said in your OCIJ interview -- quote:
"Oeun, the division commander, was arrested by mid-'77. I was
informed of this because I attended a meeting held at a school
located next to Wat Phnom, and all cadres and combatants from
Division 310 attended. Nha announced that Oeun had been arrested
because he was a network of the American CIA. 'If you do not
believe, let me play you the audiotape.' After that, the
audiotape was played for the participants via three to four
loudspeakers." End of quote.
So you identified back at the time of this OCIJ interview, which
was back in 2009, a person named Nha, if I am pronouncing that
correctly. Does that refresh your memory? Do you remember that
this was the person who presided over the meeting?
A. I cannot recall that. During the meeting, I was sitting at the
back listening to the audiotape played over loudspeakers. I did
not know this Nha, who -- he was a new person from the southwest
and he came to take charge of Division 310.
Q. And I wanted to ask you about the timing of this meeting. Do
you know when this meeting took place, that is, how many days or
how many weeks after the time that Oeun had been arrested and
disappeared?
Are you able to tell us how long it was after Oeun's
disappearance that this meeting took place?
A. Oeun, the division commander, had been arrested for about two
weeks. Then a new replacement came from the Southwest Zone and we
were called to attend a meeting to the north of Wat Phnom.
Q. So Mr. Witness, we know from S-21 records, specifically entry
number 8135, 8135 on the OCIJ S-21 list, that Division 310
secretary, Oeun, entered S-21 on the 19th of February 1977.
You've just indicated that this meeting was a little after two
weeks of the time Oeun disappeared. Would it then be around March
1977 when this meeting took place? Does that sound about right?
A. I do not recall the details <because I did not pay much
attention to it.>
After the division commander had been arrested, everyone was
scared because they accused the entire division as enemies and
that we had to refashion ourselves. The arrests took place in the
Central Zone as well as those belonging to <the division. These
people from the two places were considered enemies>. And for that
reason, I did not pay much attention to any specific date during
that period.
Q. That's certainly understandable, Mr. Witness. Thank you.
The meeting that you attended at Wat Phnom, how long was that
meeting? Was it just one day? Was it a meeting that lasted
several days? What can you tell us about how long this meeting
was?
A. The meeting lasted for three days.
Q. And in terms of the playing of this recording of Oeun, for how
long did they play this recording over the loudspeakers?
A. The new commander, that is, the commander of the division,
spoke about the traitorous division and about those traitors in
the Central Zone <and in the division>. After he made that
speech, he played the audiotape over the loudspeakers and we
could hear that it was the voice of the commander <and> we
<realised> that he had been arrested.
Q. And my question was: do you remember for how long they played
that tape for; was it for hours? Was it for more than one day?
How long was that tape recording played for you to listen to?
A.I do not recall it. It happened a long time ago.
Q. I want to read to you, Mr. Witness, an excerpt from another
OCIJ interview of someone who came from -- also came from
Division 310 and was a medic who worked at the -- who had worked
at the Preah Ket Mealea Hospital, a person named Yoeun Sambau
alias Yorn.
MR. LYSAK:
Mr. President, with your leave, if I could provide so the witness
can see this person's name and his biographical details to see if
he knew him -- if I may provide his OCIJ interview, it's document
E3/5497.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. You're being handed the statement of this other witness who
also identifies himself as a medic from Division 310. I've put a
Post-it next to his name and biographical information. He went by
the alias Yorn.
And my first question is: Do you remember a person named Yorn who
also worked as a medic at the Preah Ket Mealea Hospital?
[14.32. 04]
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. I know that Yorn. We worked together at that hospital.
Q. I want to read to you what Yorn said about the meeting
following the arrest of Oeun. And this appears -- this is in
E3/5497; Khmer, 00343726; French, 00411791 through 92; English,
00345959 through 960. This is what Yorn had to say --
MR. KOPPE:
I think the question should be slightly reformulated, Mr.
President, because Yorn is speaking about a meeting, but not
necessarily the same meeting that this witness attended.
So, I think the question should be general. There should not be
an implication that they were the same time at the same meeting.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Mr. President, I haven't said that. That's the point of my
question. I'm going to read what Yorn said and ask him whether it
was the same meeting.
Q. This is what Yorn said about a meeting that took place after
the arrest of Oeun -- quote -- and he is talking about how he
knew of the arrest of Oeun -- quote:
"I knew this from Son Sen alias Khieu, who chaired a training
course held at Division 310 near Wat Phnom. Participants were
cadres from various battalions, companies and platoons. I was the
medic on standby to take care of those participants and I was
there. The training course lasted for three days. At that time,
Son Sen addressed to the meeting that Oeun, a division commander,
along with Sambo, another division commander, had betrayed."
And then continuing a few sentences later: "Following Oeun's
arrest, Nha was nominated the division chairman and it was
announced by Son Sen at the meeting. Nha was from the Southwest
Zone. Son Sen chaired only the first session while the following
sessions: session 2, session 3, session 4 and session 5 were
covered by Nha."
End of quote.
And my question to you, Mr. Witness: Does this sound like the
same meeting that you attended and, if so, do you remember
someone, whether Son Sen spoke at the very outset of the meeting
before it was taken over by Nha?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. <When> I was invited to a meeting to the north of Wat Phnom,
<in that school>, I could hear the voice of Nha but not Sen.
Perhaps <there was a meeting held> before I arrived <and> I
attended the second sessions.
Q. During the regime, did you know who Son Sen was and did you
ever see him at any time?
A. I heard of his name. I never saw his face. I do not know how
he looked like. <I did not know senior leaders.>
Q. And when this recording of Oeun's confession was played, were
you told whether he had been tortured in order to force him to
make that confession? Did anyone ever tell you that?
A. I do not remember it. All I know is that Oeun was arrested.
Q. You testified the other day that after this meeting, there
were arrests of other Division 310 cadres. Can you give us a
sense of how often these arrests took place, how many people in
the division were arrested following this meeting?
A. I heard that people were transferred from this unit to that
unit but they never returned. They disappeared after they were
transferred. When I asked others, I was told that they were
arrested. <When they made the arrest, they would not let us know.
They told us to transfer to this battalion or to that battalion
in order to refashion ourselves.> I do not know if they had been
sent to Tuol Sleng for detention. <All> were transferred and
never returned.
Q. Did you ever witness with your own eyes any cadres in your
battalion or other battalions in Division 310 being arrested or
taken away? Did you ever see that yourself?
A. I witnessed the cases of my <two> supervisors, Bong Sralao and
Bong Nim. They came to call them away. They were tied up. I saw
them being tied up with my own eyes. These people were my direct
supervisors.
Q. Where is it that you saw them being tied up?
***************A. They were at Boeng <Pa> Yab. I was called to
provide the treatment at Boeng <Pa>Yab close to the handicap
<office>.
The logistic unit of Battalion 314 was close to that Boeng <Pa>
Yab. A vehicle arrived and Sralao was tied up and Nim was also
tied up. Sralao <was tied up at Boeng Pa Yab> and <Nim> was tied
up close to <Wat Khmuonh>. I witnessed they were being arrested
<with my own eyes>.
Q. And who were the people who tied them up and took them away?
A. I do not know them. <The> southwest <people> had been
transferred to take charge of the location in replacement of <the
North Zone. So,> I do not know those people.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is now time for break. The Chamber will take break from now
until 3 p.m.
Court officer, please assist the witness in the waiting room
during the break time and please invite him back into the
courtroom at 3 p.m.
The Court is now in recess.
(Court recesses from 1441H to 1500H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Court is now back in session.
Again, and the floor is given to the Deputy Co-Prosecutor to put
questions to the witness.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Thank you, Mr. President.
Q. Mr. Witness, we were talking about the arrests that you
witnessed of two of your superiors and you had described what you
saw that day at Boeng Sra Yab (phonetic). The people who came to
arrest them, were they armed and did they have weapons?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. When they came to arrest Nim <and Sralao>, they were armed and
there were four to five of them. I was present there when they
came and when they arrived they called Nim to meet them and when
Nim came out he was arrested. He was <immediately> tied up and
arrested.
Q. All right. You've told -- testified that you were in Battalion
314 of Division 310, the logistics battalion, and that's
confirmed by your biography.
There are a few Battalion 314 cadres who appear in the records
from S-21 that I would like to ask you about.
MR. LYSAK:
With your leave, Mr. President, I'd like to provide to the
witness a document from S-21, a list of prisoners from Division
310. It appears in document E3/2592, E3/2592. May I provide that
to the witness with your leave?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. The two people I'd like to ask you about appear on the first
page of this document, Mr. Witness. Let's start first with number
28 on this list. Number 28 on this list of prisoners from
Division 310 is a person Ban (phonetic), identified as the
secretary of Battalion 314 who entered S-21 on the 5th of May
1977.
Your Honours, he also appears as number 13294 on the OCIJ list,
that's 13294 on the OCIJ list.
The person that I have circled, number 28, it's down at the
bottom of the first page. Do you remember this person who is
identified as the secretary of Battalion 314?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. No, I do not recall that. I only recall Yiet and Kran
(phonetic) and I don't really recall this Ba (phonetic).
Q. The second person on the same list is the person who appears
at number 14 -- number 14 on the S-21 list, E3/2592 -- and the
name of this person is Mak Yi Hoeung alias Nim. He is described
in this list as a battalion office assistant responsible for
logistics who entered S-21 on the 8th of May 1977. And the same
person also appears as number 4701 on the OCIJ list, 4701 on the
OCIJ S-21 list, where he is identified as the assistant chief of
the battalion 314 logistics office.
This person who appears at number 14 whose alias is Nim, is this
the same person that you've described in your testimony, the Nhim
who was the deputy chief of your unit?
A. Yes, I know Nim. He was my chief as well.
Q. And just so we are clear, is this the same Nhim whose arrest
you witnessed at Boeng Sra Yab (phonetic) that you just described
earlier this afternoon?
A. Yes, Nim was arrested. He was previously <stationed at> the
logistics unit in Battalion 314. However, he was based at Boeng
<Pa> Yab although he belongs to Battalion 314.
Q. Thank you.
Your Honours, for the record, Nhim also appears as number 9 in an
S-21 list of 198 prisoners who were smashed on the 10th of June
1977. That is document E3/2132, E3/2132. Again, Nhim is number 9
in that execution list.
I want to also ask you a few questions about some of the people
who had -- you had worked with at the Preah Ket Mealea Hospital.
Do you know whether any of the people, your fellow workers from
Preah Ket Mealea Hospital, were arrested or disappeared in 1977?
A. At that time, Division 310 was dissolved when the southwest
group came to take charge, so those people who worked at Preah
Ket Mealea Hospital all disappeared and I did not know whether
they were re-assigned elsewhere or they were sent elsewhere
because <I never met them again. It was because the division> was
dissolved.
Q. And the people who disappeared from Preah Ket Mealea Hospital,
were these people, who, like yourself that originally come from
the North Zone, Zone 304?
A. No, they all came from the Central Zone.
Q. I think we're talking about the same zone. Do you recall that
the Central Zone before it was called the Central Zone it was
originally known as the North Zone or Zone 304? Do you recall
that or have you forgotten that?
A. From 1970 to the time of the coup d'etat to fight the Lon Nol
soldiers, the zone was known as Zone 304.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness.
Do you know what happened to wives and relatives of the leaders
of Division 310, such as the wife of Division 310 secretary Oeun?
Do you know what happened to wives and relatives after the
leaders of Division 310 were arrested?
A. At that time I did not know, I only heard from other people
that the wives of the commanders <were> also arrested and taken
along with <their> husbands.
Q. I provided to you earlier the OCIJ interview of the fellow
medic who worked with you at Preah Ket Mealea, Yorn, and I want
to read to you another excerpt from his interview.
This is, again, E3/5497, E3/5497; Khmer, ERN 00343724 through
726; French, 00411790 through 791; and English, 00345959; and
this is what Yorn testified in his OCIJ interview. He's
discussing here the hospital.
Question: "Was Sau the hospital chairman until the fall of the
regime?"
Answer: "Sau stayed as the hospital chairman until approximately
late 1976. I heard later on that he had been sent for study
course and he just disappeared. After Sau had disappeared, Voeun,
a female, became the hospital chairwoman. Voeun was the wife of
Oeun, the commander of Division 310.
"People told one another that Sau had been arrested by the
Angkar. Following Sau's arrest, the hospital staff members were
arrested one after another."
And then continuing questions later:
"By the time Oeun, Division 310 Commander was arrested, Voeun,
Oeun's wife and the chairwoman of Angk Duong Hospital was also
arrested following Oeun's arrest." End of quote.
Do you remember the wife of Division 310 Commander Oeun and do
you remember whether she worked for a period as the chairwoman of
the Division 310 hospital?
A. At that time, he used to be chief of Division 310 hospital.
Q. Did you ever meet her?
A. <I met her at that time, but> she was in a senior position. I,
myself, was only a low-rank staff. I did not dare to speak to
her.
Q. Okay, fair enough, Mr. Witness.
MR. LYSAK
Your Honours, for the record, number 6961, 6961 on the OCIJ S-21
list is Prum Nhor alias Vien, identified as the wife of Oeun and
chief of the children's team at Division 310 entering S-21 on 26
or 27 February l977.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. Now, Mr. Witness, I want to turn now to your own arrest.
Counsel for the Defence has asked you some questions about your
arrest already. I want to ask you a few follow-ups.
You testified that you were put in the truck and taken to an
office where you stayed for two or three days. During those two
or three days, were you shackled, handcuffed or tied-up?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. They detained me and did not allow me to go anywhere. They
told me to wait for Angkar, that Angkar would come to call a
meeting and that we would be taken away. I was ordered to remain
at one place and not to go anywhere.
Q. I understand that you were ordered to remain there. Were you
put in handcuffs or were you tied-up while you were in this
office waiting for Angkar?
A. They put me in a room and the room was locked so, no, I could
not go anywhere. However, I could look outside through an iron
bar or window.
Q. Let me read to you an excerpt from your DC-Cam interview. This
is E3/7537, E3/7537, at Khmer, ERN 00019647 through 648; French,
00291005 through 06; and English, 00251255. This is from your
DC-Cam interview.
Question: "When you arrived at the prison, did they point any
guns at you?"
Answer: "No, there were no guns. They asked me if I worked with
any 'Yuon', Vietnamese spies called KGB. I said I just cured
people, I didn't have any connections. They asked if I received
any indoctrination and I said no, I just did what I was told to
do."
And continuing a little later: "I slept there overnight. On the
next morning, Yiet came. He claimed that I wasn't involved in any
activity hindering our Party. He said so. And I didn't know the
prison was there. I thought I was just transferred to work
there."
Question: "Were you handcuffed?"
Answer: "No, it was just that they didn't care about our meals. I
didn't have anything to eat and didn't know where to go and eat,
but they went out to eat so I just sat there and waited to see
where I was to be transferred. Yiet came the next day late in the
afternoon." End of quote.
I just want to confirm, Mr. Witness, is it correct that you
weren't provided any meals while you were at this office and that
the people who worked at the office would leave and leave you
there when they went to go have their meals; is that correct?
A. Yes, that's what happened. At the time, they did not care
about me.
And I never thought of the purpose why I was brought there. They
didn't think of giving us meals<. That time, there was a
collective meal,> there were food ration and if <they did not
bring it to me>, it meant that I would not have my ration.
Q. And you've said this a few times during your testimony that
you didn't know that you were at a prison office and you said in
the statement I've just read that you thought you had been
transferred to work there.
Do I understand correctly that during the couple of days you were
there that you thought you'd been sent to this new office to work
and that you didn't realize you were at a prison office until
Yiet showed up; is that correct?
A. Yes, Yiet showed up and only later on when Yiet <came for my>
release, he told me about that. <Then, I realised what happened.>
Q. And when you were released from this office, how did you
return to your unit; how were you transported back to your unit?
Did you go back with Yiet or did you go separate? Can you tell
the Court how it is that you were released and transported back
to your unit?
A. When we returned, that is, after Yiet came to resolve the
matter, I took a ride with Yiet.
Q. And what time of day was it; was it during the daytime or at
nighttime when Yiet came to get you?
A. Yiet came at noontime and after he solved the matters with
them, then we left at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Q. So when you left at three o'clock in the afternoon, can you
describe a little about what the building looked like and what
the premises -- what the area looked like that you left with Yiet
at 3 o'clock that day?
A. The building looked scary because it was not in -- it was not
in an open field <like other places>; all the doors were locked.
Q. I want to read to you an excerpt from your OCIJ interview
about your -- the time that you were arrested and brought to this
office.
Your Honours, this is at E3/7877, E3/7877; Khmer, 00342436
through 437; French, 00411785; English, 00346979; and you're
describing here the time which you were arrested -- quote:
"At that time, I lived at Anlong Kngan. An American 4x4 SUV with
covered roof but no number plate came to pick us up. They did not
tie me up when I was on the vehicle. Then the vehicle stopped at
Boeng Sra Yab (phonetic) to pick up another two men. They dropped
us at an office that I do not know what office it was." End of
quote.
When you testified to OCIJ, Mr. Witness, you didn't mention Tuol
Sleng in that interview, and in the statement I just read you
said you did not know the office where you were detained for a
couple of days. Is it correct that you don't know -- you don't
know what office you spent these two days or so in; is that
correct?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. At that time I had a suspicion because they did not use me and
they did not care about me, so I <thought> that I must have <been
guilty> because the <whole> division was accused of a traitorous
division and since I was a member, I would also be accused <of>
being a traitor.
Q. The reason I'm asking you about this is I want to get some
clarification.
You were asked yesterday -- you were read a quote from your
DC-Cam interview where you mention Tuol Sleng and you were asked
by counsel why you said you were at Tuol Sleng in your DC-Cam
interview. And this is the answer you gave yesterday and you've
given essentially the same answer here today.
You said: "After people were placed at that prison charged by Ol,
those people would be further sent to Tuol Sleng." End of quote.
Do I understand correctly that the office where you were located,
which was run by Ol, was not part of Tuol Sleng but that some of
the people at this office, as you understand it, were sent
further on to Tuol Sleng? Do I understand your testimony
correctly?
A. Yes, that quote is correct because people were not sent
straight away to Tuol Sleng, they were sent to <that office>
first before they were sent further to Tuol Sleng.
MR. LYSAK:
And just to make sure we're clear on this, Your Honours, I'd like
to provide to the witness a photograph of the wall that
surrounded the Tuol Sleng prison. This is ; I'll repeat
.
With your leave, I'll provide that to the witness and display it.
We can also display it on the screen.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may. And AV Unit, please show that document on the
screen as requested by the International Deputy Co-Prosecutor.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. Now, in this photograph that we're looking at, we see a -- on
one side what is a corrugated fence, and on the right side is a
iron wrought fence and between it a large amount of barbed wire.
My question for you, the office where you were held for two or
three days, was it in a compound that was surrounded by a fence
like this that had barbed wire?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. During the few-day detention, it was an iron fence<, it was
not barbed wire fence.> There were armed guards who were there
and they did not allow us to walk freely.
Q. I understand. My question is, did you see -- did you see
barbed wire, did you see a perimeter to this compound that had
both an outer fence and an inner fence and in between circles of
barbed wire? Did you see anything like that?
A. When I was brought to the office, the prison office, there
were no such similar fences, but <it was locked> at the prison
office, but when I was sent to Tuol Sleng, yes, there were such
<barbed wire> fences.
Q. What do you mean, when you were sent to Tuol Sleng? We're
talking here about the office where you -- run by Ol where you
spent two days. Do I understand correctly that there was no fence
like this with barbed wire at the office run by Ol? Is that
correct?
A. No fence like this. That office was the location where the
biography was collected. There were no barbed wires at that
office.
Q. And counsel asked you this yesterday, but I just want to make
sure.
After the period that you spent these two days at the office run
by Ol, did you ever go back to look at Tuol Sleng at any time
after the end of the Khmer Rouge regime?
A. I never went after 1979. After the attacks and the victory of
the Vietnamese after 1979, <I went to my native homeland;> I
never went to Tuol Sleng. However, I came to Phnom Penh once in a
while.
Q. And, just so we're clear here, do I understand correctly that
when Yiet came to pick you up at Ol's office that he took you in
his vehicle from Ol's office back to your unit? Is that right?
A. He took me back.
Q. Now, you indicated in the OCIJ interview that I read a few
minutes ago that at the time you were picked up -- first picked
up by the truck, you were at a place called Anlong Kngan.
Can you tell us, where was Anlong Kngan and what were you doing
at that location before you were arrested?
A. When I was arrested, I was still a medic going around and
treated soldiers at Anlong Kngan <office, Khmuonh, Kob Srov. I
gave treatment to> those soldiers who were working on the farm
and some were operating <> rice millers. <Some were working to
distribute rice to soldiers.> I was still a medic at the time.
Q. And could you just give us some sense of where -- where was
Anlong Kngan; was it in Phnom Penh or was it outside the city?
A. The logistics unit of Battalion 314 headquarter was in Phnom
Penh, but the branch -- the branches ran from <> Me Mai
(phonetic) <village> up to Boeng <Pa> Yab and <Kob Srov>. <At Kob
Srov,> there was a <sawmill while at Anlong Kngan>, there was <a
rice mill where rice was reserved for soldiers>.
Q. So do I understand that this was an area where Division 310
people had them sent to farm rice? This is the same area as Boeng
Sra Yab (phonetic).
A. Anlong Kngan was a bit further <> to <Boeng Pa Yab>. Members
of Division 310 went to farm rice <within> the location up until
<Kob Srov>.
Q. Thank you for clarifying that, Mr. Witness.
I want to turn now to some quick questions about the Kampong
Chhnang airport site that you were -- you already testified that
you were sent to that site sometime after your arrest.
You testified that you were sent -- that you were told you were
being sent to this place for tempering or re-fashioning. What did
you understand it to mean when you were told you were being sent
to Kampong Chhnang airport for tempering or refashioning; what
did you understand that to mean?
A. They sent me to Kampong Chhnang airfield, the refashioning
location. I was told to refashion myself so that I can survive
from the killings.
If <one> had not tried <his> best to refashion <himself, for
example, if he put his arms or legs into the machine, these would
be cut because it was said that the cog was running.> So I was
told to try my best to <refashion myself. I dared not counter
them>.
Q. And how many months in total did you work at the Kampong
Chhnang airport site?
A. I was refashioned at that location for three months, then they
said Vietnam attacked Kampuchea. It was at the time when I was
told that we had been all refashioned <enough> so we had to be
equipped with weapons in order to go to <counter-attack the>
Vietnamese because Vietnam invaded Kampuchea.
Q. In the three months that you were refashioned at the Kampong
Chhnang airport site, was this in 1977 or 1978?
A. <The refashion happened> in 1978.
Q. Can you describe for the Court the work that you were required
to perform during these three months that you were at the Kampong
Chhnang airport site?
A. They built an airport in Kampong Chhnang. I was told to dig
the ground and burn the explosives in the mountains<. The airport
was built to house war planes ready to fight against the enemies.
After the dynamite exploded, we cut> stones <but some people were
made to dig dirt>. And we were told to remove all the garbage
<out of the 10 metre-depth pit>, even a small piece of it because
they were afraid that <when the> war planes <landed, the runway
would succumb>.
Q. You indicated that one of your tasks was -- it was translated
as burning explosives in the mountain in order to get stones.
Can you be a little more specific? Did you handle explosives
yourself and can you tell the Court what it is that you had to
do?
A. There was a comrade who was specialized in burning that
explosive. I was the one who <cut>  rocks in order to install the
explosive in the hole.
Q. So you would break a hole in the rock where the explosive
would be put. How was the explosive detonated after you had
created this hole and the explosive had been put in; how were
these explosives detonated?
A. When we burned the explosive, it exploded. Explosive exploded
like a bomb and some of those who stayed close to the area could
-- got injured of the pieces -- <like the shrapnel of a grenade>.
Q. Just so I understand, when you said that you would burn them,
do you mean that you would -- these explosives had a fuse that
you would light? Is that how they were set-off?
A. There was a fuse and <cordite was put inside> that fuse.
Q. And how often were workers injured or killed when these
explosives were ignited?
A. Some were digging  dirt. They did not pay attention to the
stone <pieces> and got <severely> injured. <The one who burned
the fuse would run away for safety but> many of them who did not
pay attention to the ignition of the fuse got injured <>.
Q. How often during the three months you were there, how much of
that time, how much of the three months did you spend working on
the blasting of the rock, the use of these explosives?
A. I started my work at 4.00 in the morning, but I had to wake up
one hour before, that is, at 3 a.m. <for a meeting>, and I had to
work in blasting the rock or burning the wick until 12 p.m.
Q. What I was trying to understand was, is this something that
you did every day during the three months you were at Kampong
Chhnang or is it something you only worked on for a specific time
period?
A. It depended on the supervisor who assigned the work. Sometime
it was my shifts. For example, if I was tasked with digging the
dirt, I had to do, and some others would be assigned to blast the
rock. <So, it depended on the supervisors who assigned the
tasks.>
Q. Let me read what you said in your OCIJ interview, E3/7877 at
Khmer, 00342437; English, 00346979; French, 00411785 through 786;
and you're describing here your work at Kampong Chhnang. I quote:
"I was sent to Kampong Chhnang alone in approximately 1978. They
had me make holes in the rock to put dynamites for the blasting
in order to make caves for parking aircrafts and the rocks were
grinded for the airfield runways. On average, five to six people
got injured because of the blasting." End of quote.
I wanted to get some clarification of what you meant when you
said that on average five to six people got injured. Were you
talking about every day, every week, every month? Can you give us
a sense of how often people were injured as a result of the
dynamite blasting?
A. During the time that we ignited the wick or fuse, if <there
was a plan to blast more mountain's rocks,> a lot of fuses were
burnt or ignited, many were injured. But if on some particular
day, not so many fuses or wicks were burned, not so many people
got injured by the rock pieces.
Q. Okay. I'd like to show you a few photographs that we have on
the Kampong Chhnang site.
MR. LYSAK:
Mr. President, with your leave, let me start with -- these are
photographs that appear in the OCIJ Site Identification Report,
E3/8041, E3/8041 at Khmer . And there's two
photographs on that page that I will show the witness.
And, with your leave, if I can provide that to the witness, and I
think we can also display them on the screen?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed.
AV Unit, please show the video or photo on the screen as
requested by the Deputy Co-Prosecutor.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. So there are two photographs on the page I've just handed you,
and if we can show the first one on the screen?
So the first photograph I want to ask you about, you can see a
gentleman pointing and in the background there is a hill with a
rock face.
Do you recognize this location, Mr. Witness, and if so can you
tell us what it is?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. It appears not the location where I worked. I do not recognize
it.
Q. Do you know -- were you working at the same location where you
were blasting the rock? Was this the same place that they were
making a tunnel into the mountain or was that at a different
location?
A. A tunnel was made in order to keep aeroplanes. <Holes were
drilled> into the mountain <to house planes>. It was said that a
tunnel was built in order to allow the aeroplanes to land in that
tunnel.
Q. And my question to you was, the place where this tunnel was
being blasted out of the mountain, was that the same place where
you were helping to plant explosives?
A. That location <of rock-blasting> ran from the airport. There
were people <digging dirt to> build the runway <while some
ignited the fuses worked at the mountain. The airfield had to be
neatly done> in order to allow the plane to land.
MR. LYSAK:
All right. Mr. President, if we can display on the screen the
second photograph. This is from the same page of the OCIJ Site
Identification Report, E3/8041. If we we can show the second
photograph?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. And this is on the same page that I handed to you, Mr.
Witness. In this photograph, this individual is pointing to a
wall of some sort, and my question for you is: Do you remember
the -- this location, the wall that this witness is pointing to?
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may only answer when the microphone is activated.
MR. NUON TRECH:
It <was> not really a wall <of the mountain but it was the
mountain itself where the tunnel was drilled>. In fact, <> we
broke the rocks in order to build the runway. The airport was not
yet completed at the time because we were moved to attack the
Vietnamese troops at the border.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. Do you remember whether there was -- whether it was a small
hill or a small wall that was built for workers to hide behind
when the dynamite exploded; do you remember anything like that?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. I recalled that there was a small wall but not a big one, the
one which <was> pointed by that individual. <I do not recall a
big one because it was not done yet at the time.>
MR. LYSAK:
Mr. President, I have some additional photographs to show and
these photographs come from what is the third Site Identification
Report done by OCIJ. This is a Site Identification Report that's
specifically related to the tunnel. It is document E3/8055,
E3/8055.
With your leave, I'd like to provide that report to the witness,
and I have some questions about the photographs that appear in
it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. Mr. Witness, if you can turn to the -- what is the second
photo in here.
And if we can display it on the screen as well, with your leave,
Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. If you could go back to the photo before that one.
So the photograph that we're looking at now, Mr. Witness, is the
-- a hole that was blasted into the side of this mountain. That
is the beginning of a tunnel.
Do you recognize this location? Do you know if this is the place
where you were blasting a rock using dynamite?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. Yes, that <was> the location <where I worked>, but I cannot
remember well <> .
Q. Do you remember how deep at the end of the three months that
you worked at the site, this tunnel that was being blasted into
the mountain, how deep was it at that point in time; how many
metres deep was the tunnel into the mountain?
A. I was there for three months. The tunnel was about
metres  
         10   deep. The rock was hard and we could make the hole inside it step
by step.
Q. If we could now show the next photograph? This is photograph
number 3 that appears in OCIJ's Site Report, E3/8055. If we can
show that on the screen?
Mr. Witness, this is a photograph that was taken by investigators
just after entering the tunnel, the hole that we saw in the
previous photograph.
At the time that you left the site, do you remember how high --
how high was the tunnel that you had built or blasted in the
mountain?
MR. KOPPE:
We don't dispute tunnels being built at Kampong Chhnang airfield
at all, and I'm sure this is one of the tunnels, but putting this
tunnel to the witness and then leading him into confirming this,
is, of course, not any proper manner in getting evidence. But, as
I said, we concede that tunnels were being built.
MR. LYSAK:
I'm grateful that counsel concedes that.
I have questions I would like to ask the witness about this
process. I think the photographs give us a picture of what was
going on there.
So if I may proceed, Mr. President?
My question is: how high was the tunnel at the end of the three
months that this witness worked?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please observe the microphone, Mr. Witness.
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. I do not recall. It happened a long time ago.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. Let me ask you a few more questions before we finish today.
You've indicated that you used dynamite, that you had to light a
fuse. How long after the fuse was lit did people have to protect
themselves or hide before the explosion took place? Do you
remember how long you had to get away from the explosion site?
MR. NUON TRECH:
A. When the fuse was being lighted, we had to run <away>.
Sometime we could run in time but some other times, we did not
run timely to a safer place.
Q. Did you -- were you aware of, during the three months you were
there, whether any people were killed as a result of these
explosions?
A. Sometimes I heard the blast hit the back of the neck and
people died, but I did not witness dead bodies. We were divided
into groups in charge of -- with different tasks to perform.
MR. LYSAK:
Mr. President, I was going to turn to some questions about the
general conditions. If you want me to continue, I can, or I can
break here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. It is now time for the adjournment.
The Chamber will resume its hearing on Wednesday, 7 December 2016
at 9 a.m.
Tomorrow, the Chamber will conclude the testimony of this
witness. Please be on time.
Mr. Witness, the hearing of your testimony has not come to an end
yet. You are therefore invited to come and testify again
tomorrow.

to the place where he is staying now and please invite him into
the courtroom tomorrow, and it may take only one session in the
morning tomorrow.
Security personnel are instructed to bring Nuon Chea and Khieu
Samphan back to the ECCC detention facility and have them
returned into the courtroom before 9 a.m. tomorrow.
The Court is now adjourned.
(Court adjourns at 1605H)
