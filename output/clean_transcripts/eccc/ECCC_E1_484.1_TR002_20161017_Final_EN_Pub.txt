PROCEEDINGS
(Court opens at 0905H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Court is now in session.
Today, the Chamber continues to hear testimony of witness Cheal
Choeun and begins hearing testimony of <the witness,> TCW-1037.
Ms. Se Kolvuthy, please report the attendance of the parties and
other individuals to today's proceedings.
THE GREFFIER:
Mr. President, for today's proceedings, all parties to this case
are present.
Mr. Nuon Chea is present in the holding cell downstairs. He has
waived his right to be present in the courtroom. The waiver has
been delivered to the greffier.
The witness who is to conclude his testimony today, that is, Mr.
Cheal Choeun, and his duty counsel are present in the courtroom.
The upcoming witness, 2-TCW-1037, confirms that, to the best
knowledge, the witness has no relationship, by blood or by law,
to any of the two accused, that is, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan,
or to any of the civil parties admitted in this case. The witness
will take an oath before the Iron Club Statue this morning, and
the witness has Mr. Moeurn Sovann as duty counsel.
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber now decides on the request by Nuon Chea.
The Chamber has received a waiver from Nuon Chea, dated 17
October 2016, which states that due to his health, that is,
headache, back pain, he cannot sit or concentrate for long. And
in order to effectively participate in future hearings, he
requests to waive his right to be present at the 17 October 2016
hearing.
He advises that his counsel advised him about the consequence of
this waiver, that in no way it can be construed as a waiver of
his rights to be tried fairly or to challenge evidence presented
to or admitted by this Court at any time during this trial.
Having seen the medical report of Nuon Chea by the duty doctor
for the accused at the ECCC, dated 17 October 2016, which notes
that, today, Nuon Chea has a numbness to the left side of the
body and has a lower back pain and cannot sit for long and
recommends that the Chamber shall grant him his request so that
he can follow the proceedings remotely from the holding cell
downstairs.
Based on the above information and pursuant to Rule 81.5 of the
ECCC Internal Rules, the Chamber grants Nuon Chea his request to
follow today's proceedings remotely from the holding cell
downstairs via an audio-visual means.
The Chamber instructs the AV Unit personnel to link the
proceedings to the room downstairs so that Nuon Chea can follow.
That applies for the whole day.
And before I hand the floor to the parties to put questions to
the witness, the Chamber wishes to remind the parties of the
following.
When there is replies to a party who is standing or replies to
the Bench, please leave adequate pause so that interpreters can
do a proper interpretation <and please speak slowly.>
In relation to .3 and a subsequent document,
<.4,> that is, in relation to the written records of
witness 2-TCW-1066, these are the disclosures from Case 004,
please reminded that if these two documents are referred to,
please refer to only the pseudonym, that is, 2-TCW-1066, and not
the full names.
The Bench put questions to this witness rather extensively, and
now the Chamber hands the floor to the Co-Prosecutors and the
Lead Co-Lawyers. And you have one session. And the same thing is
for the defence teams, that is, one session for both.
Co-Prosecutor, you have the floor.
QUESTIONING BY MR. KOUMJIAN:
Thank you. Just to be clear, Your Honour is saying we have one
session combined, together. Thank you.
Q. Good morning, Mr. Witness. I just wanted to ask you some
questions to clarify what you told us last week, and I appreciate
that you've been very clear and only have told us what you
remember that you saw and heard, so I'd like to continue to do
that.
You told us that you had been a monk. Can you tell us when you
studied to be a monk?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. I ordained as a monk in 1970.
Q. Now, prior to being ordained, did you study in a pagoda?
A. I studied in a pagoda school, and then in 1970, when the war
broke out, I ordained in the pagoda where I studied.
Q. How many years of schooling did you have, prior to being
ordained?
A. I studied for three years.
Q. Do you still consider yourself a Buddhist?
A. I do not understand your question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, do you still follow the Buddhist religion?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
Yes, I am still a Buddhist.
BY MR. KOUMJIAN:
Q. Thank you, Sir. Sir, can you explain to us what happened that
you stopped being a monk?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. I left the monkhood in 1975, that is, after the country had
peace. The Ministry of Religion went to hold meetings in various
pagodas and instructed monks to work in the rice fields and to
plant cotton for self-service since there -- we would no longer
receive support. And for that reason, I left the monkhood.
Q. When you talk about the Ministry of Religion, this was the
Ministry of what government or force?
A. The Ministry of Religion on the Khmer Rouge side.
Q. So between 1970 and the end of the war in 1975, where were
you?
A. From 1970 to 1975, that is, during the period that I ordained
as a monk, I stayed at Boeng Khnar pagoda. And in 1972, my mother
was evacuated by the Khmer Rouge to live in a forest, and I
missed my mother, so I went to look for her. And I met by members
of the Ministry of Religion, and I was not allowed to return.
Then I was put in <Prey Kantuot> (phonetic) pagoda <>.
However, I did not meet my mother when I was sent to reside in
<that> pagoda.
Q. So correct me if I don't understand you. What I understood
from your answer is that in 1972, you went to look for your
mother and the Ministry of Religion of the Khmer Rouge stopped
you and kept you in one place and did not allow you to go to
where your mother was. Is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Where was it that they kept you?
A. When I left the pagoda to that area, which was about three
kilometres from my mother's village, I went to look for my mother
there. Then I was questioned and I said I came from Boeng Khnar
pagoda. They did not allow me to return, and they let me live at
Prasat village and then took me to Prey Kantuot (phonetic)
pagoda, which was about 30 kilometres away from the village.
Q. So is it correct that, for the years from '72 to '75, while
the Khmer Rouge restricted your movement, you were still robed
and you were still a monk? Is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Now, after -- you've told us that you were called to a meeting
and told that you would no longer receive support and had to work
in the rice fields. Did that happen to other monks, to your
knowledge? Were any exempted from that?
A. At the location where I lived, that is, <> in Bakan district,
all the monks were treated the same.
Q. Did any of the monks protest or refuse to disrobe?
A. No monk dared to do that. All monks kept quiet and, monk was
disrobed <one after another until there was no monk in the
pagoda>.
Q. For the years from the Khmer Rouge victor in April 1975, until
their fall in 1979, did you see any monks who were allowed to
practise their religion during the regime?
A. No, there was none at that time. There were no monks.
Q. What about other practices of Buddhism and traditions --
Buddhist traditions in your area? Were people allowed to do
whatever traditions you had regarding prayers, regarding
funerals, regarding weddings?
A. I did not witness any of such thing. I did not see any monks
at a funeral or any wedding ceremony.
Q. Do you know if the regime -- and if you don't know, say so --
allowed the practice of religion, for example, Buddhists praying
or Muslims praying?
A. No, not at the time.
Q. Thank you.
So let me move on a little bit and talk to you -- you've talked
about this in some depth, so I won't repeat all the questions,
but I want to ask you about the time that you were given a gun
and put into Platoon 35 of Battalion 18.
You told us that you were sent to guard Lon Nol soldiers or
officers. Can you tell us, did you ever learn what had been said
to those soldiers and officers that were among the group?
A. They didn't say anything.
Q. Do you know if the soldiers were told where they were going?
A. I did not know about that. I did not know whether they were
told where they were to go to.
Q. You said something about Samdech Sihanouk. Can you explain the
relationship with Samdech Sihanouk to that incident?
A. I did not know about that because I did not see him, nor did I
hear people talking about Samdech.
Q. Were the soldiers that you saw -- you said that they were
disarmed, they didn't have weapons. Is that correct?
A. Yes, they did not have any weapon.
Q. Were they tied in any way?
A. No, they were not tied. They <were> walked as usual.
Q. You said it was a group of over 50. To be clear, did any of
them survive the shooting, to your knowledge?
A. At the time, maybe about three of them fled away, though I did
not know whether they survived, although they were not chased
after, after they fled.
Q. And the others, is it -- do you know if the others all were
killed other than the three?
A. Yes, they were killed, at least those who remained there.
Q. Were all of these -- were all of these men, or were there any
women in the group?
A. <The military side?> Which side are you asking me?
Q. Thank you. That's a good question.
I'm asking about the Lon Nol soldiers. Were there any women in
that group that was brought to be shot?
A. There was no woman. They were all men.
Q. You said -- you talked about uniforms. Were they all in
uniforms, or only some of them?
A. They were all in military uniform.
Q. Now, at that time, could you distinguish from the uniform
insignias on the uniform officers from regular soldiers?
A. The uniform belonged to the Lon Nol para soldiers.
Q. Did you recognize any of the people in that group?
A. No, I did not.
Q. You said you were kicked and forced to fire your gun. Is that
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you ever fire your gun again?
A. After I was kicked and I was ordered to fire my gun, in fact,
those soldiers had fallen because they were shot by people behind
me. At that time, I -- my body was shaking because I was so
shocked to witness such an event.
Q. Okay. Thank you. My question wasn't clear. Let me try to
rephrase it.
After that incident where these men were killed, that you
witnessed, did you ever shoot your gun at another human being or
were you involved in any battles after that as a soldier?
A. No. Later on, my group was sent to live and work at Moung
<district>. And since I witnessed that incident, it reminded me
of why they did that because we wanted to make a revolution. And
I questioned Doeun, whom I knew, and Doeun told me -- rather, I
asked him why they did that to those soldiers, why didn't they
use their labour, and I was told why I wanted to know about that.
Then I thought back why I had put that question to him, and I
knew that it was a mistake. Since then, I stopped questioning him
again. And I was afraid that maybe one day, I would be being
monitored. And I still had that feeling constantly at that time
until about a month later when I was transferred to work as a
railroader worker.
Q. Okay. Thank you. There's a couple things in your answer that I
would like to -- you to explain a bit more.
First, you said your unit was then transferred to work somewhere.
I thought you said Moung. I probably didn't -- I'm not
pronouncing it correctly.
Which unit are you speaking about, and can you tell us about
where you were transferred to work?
A. At that time, it was not only my unit, but other members of
other units were combined or reintegrated, and we were sent to
work as rail workers.
Q. So the whole -- is it correct that the entire group that was
sent to work with you on the railroad were former soldiers or
Khmer Rouge troops?
A. They selected people whom I used to work, and they separated
some. And as for us, we were sent to work for railroad, and when
we arrived at the railway station, we saw other people who also
arrived at that railway station.
Q. Was the station in Battambang, or where was it?
A. It was <a station> in Battambang.
Q. Was Doeun also sent to the railroad?
A. Later on, I didn't know where Doeun was sent to.
Q. Can you tell us a little bit about what you know about the
biography of Doeun?
A. I met Doeun for a short period of time, and I did not dare at
the time ask him about his origin. And later on, we separated and
we have been separated until now.
Q. Okay. Thank you.
Is it correct that Doeun was the head of unit or Battalion --
excuse me, of Unit 35, rather?
A. That is true.
Q. Okay. Thank you.
Now, the railroad. Can you tell us what you know about how that
railroad was working during the years that you worked there? You
said you were there all the way until '79 when the Vietnamese
arrived. Where did the trains run from; from where to where?
A. I did not know where the train ran from and to. I was told to
build a railroad from Ou Salao (phonetic) to Battambang and <from
Battambang> to Kbal Khmaoch. My group was in charge of building
the bridge and the railroad.
Q. Did you see the trains go by?
A. I saw the train running on a daily basis. And I did not know
the last station -- where was the last station of the train.
Q. Would you see the train stop in Battambang?
A. The train stopped at a station in Battambang.
Q. Did you ever see things loaded or unloaded from the train?
A. I did not see <the loading>, but I did see things unloaded.
Q. Did you ever see people come off the train?
A. No, <I did not see passengers on> the train. In fact, I saw
the <carriages> of the train doors closed. <> In fact, I saw only
the workers on the train, and there were no passengers like in
the previous regime, that is, Sangkum Reastr Niyum.
Q. Did you ever meet people in your region who had been
transported by the train from the East Zone or other areas of the
country?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please hold on, Mr. Witness.
You may now proceed, Koppe.
MR. KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. President, and good morning.
I object to this question. Whatever happened to either East Zone
people or Khmer Krom people transferred in 1978, from the East
Zone is outside the scope of Case 002/02.
It's the same, in our opinion, that goes to the fate of Lon Nol
soldiers in the immediate aftermath of the evacuation of Pursat
and Battambang, but in relation to Khmer Krom and East Zone
people, I believe there's a specific ruling from the Chamber for
sure when it comes to Khmer Krom people.
So all these questions from the Prosecution are relating to
topics, which are outside of the scope of 002.
MR. KOUMJIAN:
Your Honour, I haven't mentioned Khmer Krom. I'm talking about
the railroads and the strategic importance of the railroads.
That's actually the topic that I'm addressing.
As for the killing of Lon Nol soldiers being within the scope of
Case 002/01, there was only one massacre of Lon Nol soldiers,
that being Tuol Po Chrey that was part of Case 002/01. The rest
is part of Case 002/02.
So my question, if I recall it, was simply whether he had seen
people transported or heard from people that they had been
transported on the trains, and it's up to you, but it's going
only to the strategic significance of the trains.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber overrules the objection put by the Defence Counsel,
and the Chamber needs to hear the response from the witness to
the question.
Mr. Witness, do you recall the question asked by the
International Co-Prosecutor, and if you forget, Mr.
Co-Prosecutor, could you repeat it?
BY MR. KOUMJIAN:
Q. Okay. I'm going to repeat it, but I'm going to add a little
something to the question.
So my question, sir, is, did you ever hear from anyone about
people being transported on the train from other parts of
Cambodia, including civilians or including soldiers from the
Southwest Zone, for example? Did you hear anything like that?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. I never heard of it. I do not know about that.
Q. You said you saw things being loaded on the train. What was
being put on the train when you observed that?
A. I saw stuff unloaded, and the stuff included salt and <>
cement, <there was nothing else>. And as for other stuff, I did
not know whether they -- the train transported other stuff as
well because I was prohibited from seeing the stuff being
unloaded. All I could see at the time was cement, and the cement
was stored in the warehouse at the station.
Q. Were there any foreign advisors working for the railways,
Chinese or others that you saw?
A. Within the compound of the rail -- the train station, I never
saw any Chinese advisors. I did not know where the -- those
advisors were living.
Q. Well, did you ever see them in Cambodia during the four years?
Did you see Chinese advisors in your area and, if so, where?
A. I saw them living in a brick house in -- opposite the station.
I saw them from the place where I was working. Those workers, <>
my colleagues told me, were Chinese guests.
Q. Do you know what their jobs were or what they were doing
there?
A. On this particular point, I did not know their work. At 4 in
the morning, I was asked to come and work at the railroad<>.
Q. Was the food, given to the workers on the railroad sufficient?
A. The livelihood was not really good. We did not have
<>sufficient food to eat, but we had to bear the situation. In
the morning, we woke up at 4 a.m. in the morning and we went to
collect the rice from the site. We had to cook porridge by
ourselves <at the site> in the morning. And we mixed the rice
with the pumpkins leaves and other plants.
Q. If you know from what you observed and from what others told
you, would say that railway workers were treated better than the
typical worker in the region at that time?
A. When I was living at that location, we could find pumpkins and
pumpkins leaves, <>other plants <and bananas> to cook mixing with
the porridge or gruel. That could make the gruel better. However,
<>we could not eat at our fill, but we could survive with such a
meal.
Q. My question is the comparison. Perhaps -- I don't know, but
perhaps some workers came in to work at the railway station that
had been in other places. Do you know if the conditions were
actually better for railway workers than for others? If you don't
know, say so.
[09.44.48[]
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please hold on.
You may now proceed, Counsel Anta Guisse.
MS. GUISSE:
Thank you, Mr. President.
I must say that I'm a little bit lost here, and I object to the
line of questioning of the Co-Prosecutor because it does not
appear to me that in the scope of 002/02 the railway work site at
Battambang is part of the Chamber's selection in terms of
<worksites that fall under this trial>. So, I don't understand
why this line of questioning <is being pursued>. Therefore, I
object.
BY MR. KOUMJIAN:
Your Honour, to explain my point, it's one that Philip Short
makes in his book where he says that certain people in
responsible positions lived apart from the masses, and privileged
groups such as railway workers whose loyalty was crucial to the
regime were fed not merely adequately, but well.
So that was the point I was trying to explore with the witness.
Q. So sir, do you know -- can you answer my question, or you
don't know, whether railway workers had it better than the other
workers in the region?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. I did not know if my workstation was better than others. I was
not allowed to move freely and to make contact <> with one
another.
Q. Okay. I'm going to move on, then, to another subject.
You talked about assisting making a film. Can you tell us why you
did that? Why did you assist in making that documentary?
A. <Regarding> the documentary, I did not assist them much. I was
asked to accompany the filmmaker. The filmmaker did not know the
location, and I was asked by him to guide him.
Q. Okay. Thank you. Your Honour, there's a couple of short clips
of the witness' interview, the audio recording of the witness'
interview, that came up on his testimony Friday, where he said
something that he said he did not say in the interview. And I
would like to play those for the witness now if I have the
interview.
The first one relates to the name -- a name he gave of the
company commander. It was -- excuse my disorganization. On page
88 of the draft transcript at about 14.13.37, the witness talked
about the name of the supervisor of Unit -- of the company
commander. And I would like to play the portion of the witness
interview from 10 -- E3/10681, where the witness gives his answer
about that name.
So I believe this is actually the second tape. There's two little
audio tapes. It's very, very short, so my suggestion is that the
audio booth play it twice and the interpreters interpret it the
second time. It only lasts seconds, but I think playing it twice
will allow the interpreters and the witness to catch what is
being said. If that could be played, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the <>request <is> granted. And AV Unit, please show the
video clip on the screen. And please play the clips two times.
(Audio-visual presentation)
MR. KOUMJIAN:
I'm guessing this is the second one that I also wanted to play,
from the looks of puzzlement of Your Honours. And this is about
what you made when you were on -- at the railway.
Sir -- there's an objection.
MR. KOPPE:
At least I would like to get a translation from the interpreters
as to what this clip says so that I can follow the question.
So the clip that was just played, should -- I mean, it went very
quickly, I understand, but it should be interpreted.
JUDGE FENZ:
I think the idea was to play one clip twice. That's what went
wrong. But I agree; I'm getting a bit confused now, too, as to
where this is going.
MR. KOUMJIAN:
I apologize because some -- I had written down the times and the
questions, and I haven't brought that with me.
There are two clips. One of them relates to the witness' answer
where the video -- where the record of interview says he was
making bombs, and I believe that is what was played, his actual
answer. I believe it's number -- I don't know if anyone has that
number of the answer in the WRI. I thought it was 42, but it's
not.
JUDGE FENZ:
But we have allowed frequently these to be provided within the
next session, but a bit later, but perhaps we can --
MR. KOUMJIAN:
Okay. This --
JUDGE FENZ:
-- go ahead with simply playing it and asking for a translation.
MR. KOUMJIAN:
Okay. There are two answers from the WRI. First is answer 42, and
I believe that's not the one that was played, but I could be
wrong. And it starts at one minute and 12 -- one hour and 12
minutes into the tape, approximately.
The second one, which I'm guessing is the one that was played,
but the interpreters could tell us, is answer 121, which starts
around two hours, 12 minutes and 20 seconds.
So I don't know which one was played because my Khmer is bad, but
perhaps we could just ask to play it again and, as Counsel said,
have the interpreter interpret the answer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
AV Unit, please play the audio clip of the interview by the
witness.
(Audio-Visual presentation)
THE INTERPRETER KHMER-ENGLISH:
The <chief of the Company> was Roeut.
BY MR. KOUMJIAN:
Thank you. That was answer 42 from the WRI, which had been
recorded as Vuth in the WRI.
Q. Mr. Witness, did you say -- what name did you use for the name
of your company commander in that tape?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. It was Roeut.
Q. Thank you. Now there's another portion of your interview, and
this is answer 121. I want to play that tape.
But just so you know the context, you're talking about working at
the Battambang railway station, and it says -- and you were
talking about what you were assigned to do during the regime.
So again, if we could play this short clip twice, and the second
time, if the interpreters could interpret it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. AV Unit, please play the audio clip twice. And the
interpreters are asked to concentrate and interpret the portion
so that parties could be informed.
(Audio-visual presentation)
THE INTERPRETER KHMER-ENGLISH:
At the time, I made bombs and my group was in charge of that.
BY MR. KOUMJIAN:
Q. Mr. Witness, did you listen to the tape?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. Yes, I listened to it.
Q. What did you say your group made? What word did you use?
A. My group built the railroad.
Q. What did you say you made during the regime?
A. I was a worker. I was a worker building the railroad.
Q. Okay. Well, first let me ask you a separate question. Did you
ever -- one moment.
(Short pause)
If I could ask, Mr. Witness, if you listen once again. There's
one word you use. I want it to be clear what word you're using.
We understood you to say you were making bombs, but listen to the
tape and you tell us what you said.
MR. PRESIDENT:
AV Unit, please play the clip once again, the last clip.
(Audio-visual presentation)
BY MR. KOUMJIAN:
Q. What did you say you made?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. I made railroad.
Q. Did you ever -- have you ever been involved in producing
anything related to music?
A. No. I could not produce any such thing.
Q. I'm going to move on.
JUDGE FENZ:
I'm sorry. The issue was obviously was the word "bomb" correctly
translated.
MR. KOUMJIAN:
Yes.
JUDGE FENZ:
What's the outcome of that?
BY MR. KOUMJIAN:
Well, I don't speak Khmer. Someone who -- my understanding was
that the word sounded like the word for a musical instrument, a
string instrument. And I could ask the witness that directly.
Q. Sir, did you ever make string instruments?
Actually, I'd like my colleague -- it makes a lot more sense for
my colleague to ask the questions.
MR. SONG CHORVOIN:
Q. Mr. Witness, in the audio clip, the staff members in the OCP
listened to it on many occasions and we heard that your group
made bomb, not railroad. We would like to clarify this point with
you so that it is clear for everyone in the courtroom.
So now my question is, did your group make railroad or make bomb
<at that time>?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. My group was making railroad.
JUDGE FENZ:
Sorry. Did you hear yourself in the audio? Is this you speaking?
And did -- if so, did you use a word -- did you use the word that
is -- that we can hear?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
I already responded that I was building railroad.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, please move on.
JUDGE FENZ:
Mic isn't on, I believe.
BY MR. KOUMJIAN:
Q. Sir, did you get married during the regime?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. Yes.
Q. Did you want to get married at that time?
A. At that time, I did not want to get married because it was
easier for me to live a single life, <> if I got married, then I
had to look after another person. And for that reason, I did not
want to.
Q. Did you have any intention of returning to the monkhood if you
could, if that ban on Buddhism ever ended?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. So tell us what happened that you ended up being married
during the regime.
A. At that time, Pheap, who was my direct supervisor at where we
built railroad, told me that it was the determination by Angkar.
And I told him that I did not want to have a wife because it was
easier for me to live a single life, and he said that I could not
object to the determination by Angkar. And for that reason, I
kept quiet.
Q. Can you briefly explain to those of us who weren't there
during the regime why is it you didn't continue to refuse and
just say, "I will not get married"? What were you afraid of?
A. I did not dare to speak because when I heard that it was the
determination by Angkar, I kept quiet because I was afraid. I was
afraid to die. And later on, they arranged my marriage.
Q. You talked about people disappearing during the regime. Can
you tell us, when did that start and did it -- more people
disappear at certain times than others? Can you explain?
A. Regarding the disappearance of people, to my knowledge,
namely, Pheap, he was not called for a study session, but when we
returned from our work in the evening, next morning, I heard his
family members said that he had been arrested during the night
time and taken away. That's what I heard.
Q. Did you ever hear of visits of Khmer Rouge leaders from Phnom
Penh to your region?
A. No, I did not. I did not see any of them. During the regime,
when we heard that it was a special train going through, then we
were not allowed to stay near the station. And we were not
allowed to work at the railroad. Instead, we were sent to clear
the grass.
Q. Was there special security at the railroad at any time?
A. I did not know whether there was such special security because
in the morning, we were sent out from our sleeping quarter. For
example, we were led to clear grass at the rice field or to work
in the plantation. And that happened <> at dawn, and it was far
away from the railway station. So I did not see any special
activity going on at the station.
Q. Had you heard of Nuon Chea during the regime?
A. During the regime, I did not hear of his name. I only heard of
his name after the arrival of the Vietnamese. I did not hear any
of the names of the senior leaders or saw any of them during the
regime. I only knew people around me, and some immediate
supervisors. They never made any announcements to allow us to
know who was who.
Q. Did you ever hear Khieu Samphan's name?
A. As for Khieu Samphan, I heard of his name when I was a student
during 1968 or '69. But I did not see him.
Q. Sir, did you attend political study sessions and, if so, how
often?
A. I was an ordinary worker. When the group chief convened a
meeting, I was not allowed to go near, let alone any major
meetings. And I never attended any political study session.
Supervisors went to attend those sessions, and when they
returned, they instructed us to do this or to do that, and that's
what we simply did.
For example, today, five of us would be assigned to work on the
segment of a bridge, then that's what we did.
Q. You don't recall any study sessions or any lectures you
received about enemies.
A. No, I did not.
MR. KOUMJIAN:
I think the time is up. Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Lead Co-Lawyers for civil parties, <do> you have any question
that you wish to put to the witness?
MS. GUIRAUD:
Thank you, Mr. President. We have no questions for this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
It is now appropriate time for a short break. We'll take a break
now and resume at 10.30 <a.m.> to continue our proceedings.
Court officer, please assist the witness at a waiting room
reserved for witnesses and civil parties and invite him as well
as his duty counsel back into the courtroom at 10.30 <a.m.>.
The Court is now in recess.
(Court recesses from 1011H to 1032H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Chamber is now back in session.
And I would like to give the floor to the Defence Counsel to put
questions to the witness. And first of all, the floor is given to
the Defence Counsel for Nuon Chea.
And the Chamber also would like to inform parties that <if you
use the document E3/10684 and E3/10683...>
(No interpretation)
JUDGE FENZ:
I didn't get -- I don't think we got an English translation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber now continue the session. And the floor now is given
to the Defence Counsel to put question <> to the witness.
And first of all, the floor is given to the Defence Counsel for
Nuon Chea.
And the Chamber also would like to inform that this morning, the
Chamber used the pseudonym for <the witness 2-TCW-1066>, and that
document E3/10684 and E3/10683, that if excerpts are extracted
from these two documents, <please inform the Chamber. Then the
Chamber will proceed the hearing in camera.>
And now the floor is given to defence counsel for Nuon Chea.
MR. KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. President. As a matter of fact, I --
JUDGE FENZ:
I think the ruling was a bit unclear.
MR. KOPPE:
No, it's -- I think it's clear to me, but I'm actually going to
ask a question about it.
As I understand, the witness will only be referred to parties by
his pseudonym, and once I confront this witness with an excerpt,
we should close the doors, which is fine with me. So I will save
my question until the end.
However, one note, and that is the following. The question that I
will be asking this witness and the excerpt that I will be
confronting him with is probably or potentially relevant to the
Supreme Court Chamber, so if we close the doors, then whoever is
following these proceedings on behalf of the Supreme Court
Chamber will not be able to hear the answer.
I don't know if the answer is going to be relevant, but
potentially. So I would like to signal that problem beforehand.
JUDGE FENZ:
I think we can deal with that afterwards.
QUESTIONING BY MR. KOPPE:
Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Witness. I don't have many questions
for you, just a few follow-up questions as well.
Q. Let me start by asking you, Mr. Witness, do you read and
write?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. I can write to some extent, and as for reading, I can also
read to some extent.
Q. Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to show the
witness an excerpt from document E3/1170; English, ERN 00602544
and following; Khmer, 00443016 and 17; and French, 06544895.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your request is granted.
(Short pause)
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. Mr. Witness, I am showing you an organogram of what is
wrongfully called the Northeast Zone Army. It should be the
Northwest Zone Army.
The reason why this is obvious, Mr. President, is not only
because of all the names mentioned there, but also reference to,
typically -- or not typically, but cities and villages in the
Northwest Zone such as Pailin, Kreang, etc. So the author of this
organogram mistakenly said Northeast Zone Army. This is the
Northwest Zone Army.
Mr. Witness, if you can have a look at this document. Let me
guide you through the document a bit.
It says Division 1 and Division 2. Now, let me start with the
names that you can see headed under Division 2. I can read the
names in English. They say, respectively, number 1, Khleng,
number 2, Khoy, number 3, Ren.
My question to you is the following. In your answer, in your WRI,
58, you refer to Saroeun or also known as Ren. Is this, in fact,
the commander, Ren, that you have been referring to?
JUDGE FENZ:
Can I ask you something, Witness, following up what Counsel said?
Can you read this organogram? Because you said "I can read a
bit".
Can you read this organogram, meaning the paper in front of you,
or can you not?
(Short pause)
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
I saw the names, but I do not understand.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. I understand it's a bit difficult. Let me take it step by
step.
In your WRI, E3/10681, in question and answer 58, you talk about
the commander of the division, and you say his name was Saroeun,
alias Ren. And when you now go to the document I'm showing you,
Division 2 has someone named Ren mentioned. So you can see, one,
Khleng, who was the secretary of Division 2, Khoy, who is the
deputy secretary of Division 2, and Ren, a member of Division 2.
Is he the one you talk about or, rather, is Ren the one who is
mentioned in -- as the leader of Regiment 70 below, or there's
also a Ren a bit down who was based in Pailin.
So my question is, when you speak about your division commander,
Saroeun, alias Ren, do you see that name in that organogram I
showed you?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. Yes.
Q. And Ren -- Saroeun, alias Ren, is that the number 3 of
Division 2, the member of the highest command of Division 2? Is
that correct?
A. At this point, I do not know which division he belonged to. I
only knew when the event in which Ren was involved, and that's
what I knew. But as for which division he was part of or where he
came from, I had no idea.
Q. Do you know when this particular division was named Division
2? Do you know when that came about?
A. I also did not know.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness.
Now, on that very same page, on the left side, you can also see
names belonging to Division 1. It says that Norng Sarim , alias
San, was the secretary, Division 1, Neou, its deputy secretary;
and 3, Chhorn, its member. Do you see those three names?
A. Yes, I saw the names on the paper here in front of me, but I
do not know which divisions they belonged to. And I did not know
them, either. I only saw their names on the paper in front of me
right now. But previously, I never knew them.
Q. So just to be sure, I'm particularly interested in number 3,
Chhorn, alias Chhun (phonetic). This is someone that you didn't
know at the time and you didn't know later. Correct?
MR. KOUMJIAN:
I have a question. Counsel said Chhorn, alias. Where does the
alias come from?
He said Chhorn, alias Chhun (phonetic). I don't see that in the
document.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Correct. It's not from the document. It's from the OCIJ list, so
if I have to withdraw that part, I have no problem. But this
particular Chhorn is named as number 6336 on the OCIJ list. His
name is Uk Chhoeung, alias Chhorn, commander of Division 1. So
that's where I have the alias from, but I'm happy to limit myself
to Chhorn.
Q. Mr. Division, so the Division 1 commander, Chhorn, is someone
who is not known to you; correct?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. That is correct.
Q. Now let me follow up the issue that was raised last --
MR. PRESIDENT:
<Councel> Victor Koppe, please hold on.
And the floor is given to Judge Lavergne.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Yes. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Koppe, but <for the>
purposes of the <record>, can we know who the author of this
organogram is and when it was created?
Where does this document come from?
MR. KOPPE:
It's not entirely clear, but presumably it's a document that was
originating from an S-21 cadre.
We have discussed this document, I believe, with Duch, but I'm
not entirely sure. It is coming from a notebook, but I'm not
quite sure who the author is.
In addition, I might add that it might be a post-79 notebook as
well, at least a notebook in which an overview was made after
'79. At least that's what DC-Cam seems to be suggesting.
So it's either an S-21 cadre or, presumably, originating from
DC-Cam.
JUDGE FENZ:
It's identified in the title as a DC-Cam -- sorry.
At least in the -- when you open the documents, it's identified
as a DC-Cam document and as a Khmer Rouge black -- I'm just
trying to open it now -- black journal, I think.
MR. KOPPE:
Correct, but it's a bit odd in its --
JUDGE FENZ:
The description, yes.
BY MR. KOPPE:
In its description. So I'm not entirely sure if it is, in fact, a
DC-Cam document or, rather, belonging to a cadre.
Q. So Mr. Witness, I was going to refer to an issue that was
discussed last Thursday. You were read out an excerpt from a book
authored by Thet Sambath and Gina Chon. It was suggested that the
quote, which was read out to you, had originated from you.
However, as I made clear in that same hearing, the other
filmmaker, Robert Lemkin, is saying that this quote never came
from you.
MR. KOUMJIAN:
Excuse me. I object. Counsel's testifying, and inaccurately. The
email from the -- Mr. Lemkin, I don't know if it's confidential.
I don't know if it was sent to you confidentially, but I have no
problem with the email itself being part of the record. And
Counsel has his interpretation; I have mine.
It seems to me it's clear that the witness -- or Mr. Lemkin,
rather, was saying that people were promised confidentiality and
should not have been named. But it certainly doesn't say -- I
forget the exact words Counsel used -- that this witness never
said that.
That's not what he says in the email.
MR. KOPPE:
I presume that your memo is automatically, by itself, part of the
case file. If it's not, then I'm happy to read it into the
transcript.
JUDGE FENZ:
No, no, it's -- it's obviously part of the case file. The
question is, is it confidential or public?
I don't have it at the moment, but you obviously have it in front
of you.
MR. KOPPE:
I don't think it's confidential. It doesn't say so.
JUDGE FENZ:
Because as soon as the names are -- sorry.
MR. KOPPE:
Again, it's your memo, so you should say -- you should tell me if
it's confidential; yes or no.
(Short pause)
JUDGE FENZ:
I'll ask staff to do this immediately. Could you please use
something else in the meanwhile?
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. Yes. So you were read out, as I said before, a quote from Thet
Sambath's book. The question was asked by the Judge whether you
said this. You said no. Mention is being made in that quote of
Chhoeun, Chiel Chhoeun, division commander.
Let me backtrack a bit. Were you present when a person named on
that same page, 106, of Thet Sambath's book, ERN 00757532; Khmer,
00858342; French, 00849437; is mentioned?
In that book, we can read about Chan Savuth, who was, according
to the book, head of the hospital in his region in Battambang.
And you, yourself, speak about Chan Samuth, question and answer
163, but were you present when filmmakers Lemkin and Sambath
interviewed Chan Savuth or Chan Samuth?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. I <am> not aware of this.
Q. Well, when the filmmakers asked Chan Samuth or Chan Savuth
questions, were you in the room when they asked the questions?
A. No, I was not there.
Q. Let me then ask you what you said yourself about Chan Samuth,
question and answer, as I said, 163:
"Chan Samuth is living in Rumlech village, Rumlech commune, Bakan
district, Pursat province. He stayed with me, but his parents
were taken to be killed when he was in Battambang."
"Did Chan Samuth tell you about any event which occurred in Bakan
district before he went to Battambang?"
"No, he didn't."
Do you recall saying this to the investigator that you talked
about Chan Samuth?
A. Yes, I can recall it now about Chan Samuth. When I was
transferred to work as a worker at the railway station, I met
Chan Samuth. I did not know when he arrived, but I met him there.
Chan Samuth was from Rumlech, and he was imprisoned during Lon
Nol war time. And after the war ended, he joined to be the
railway worker. <He was Kampuchea Krom and he lived in> Rumlech.
Later on, he never went to visit his homeland., and <when>
Kampuchea Krom people were purged, <neither him nor I knew about
that event.> And after the Vietnamese liberated the country, we
realized that his parents had been killed.
I met him <>during the time <> we were worker at the railway
station, and we remained together there.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. This is all about Chan Samuth.
Did Chan Samuth ever tell you at one point in time that he was
the head of the hospital in the region in Battambang?
A. No, Chan Samuth was never be a medic. The one whose name was
Chan Samuth that remained with me, he was an ethnic Kampuchea
Krom. He told me not to tell anyone that he's from Kampuchea
Krom.
He never held any position as a unit chiefs or cooperative
chiefs. He was simply just a worker like me.
Q. So the Chan Samuth you know never told you he was a medical
doctor or the chief of the military hospital in Battambang or had
a high-ranking function in Division 1. Correct?
A. That's correct. As far as I know him, because he lived in the
nearby village to mine, he never learned any medical studies or
training. I met him when I was joining the railway workforce, and
we remained working there together.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness.
Now, just to be very clear on this, you said you were never
present during Lemkin and Thet Sambath's interview with Chan
Savuth, but in your encounters with Robert Lemkin and Thet
Sambath, did they ever speak about Chan Savuth having told them
that Ros Nhim instructed Chhueun, the Division 1 commander, the
name that I just mentioned on the organogram, to contact Thai
Communists, start psychological war, etc.?
Is that my understanding? Should that be my understanding, that
Thet Sambath and Lemkin never spoke to you about Chan Savuth and
what Ros Nhim had instructed his division commander 1, Chhueun?
A. No.
MR. KOPPE:
Now, Mr. President, I'm revisiting your memo in which you quote
from Lemkin's email, and I would like to see if I can discuss
that.
JUDGE FENZ:
Just a second. It is confidential currently, but we are -- is
there any objection to reclassify this memo as public from the
Prosecution?
MR. KOUMJIAN:
No.
JUDGE FENZ:
Co-Lead Lawyers? No.
Defence team? No. Obviously not this defence team. Okay.
(Short pause)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber decides to re-categorize the document <E29/489/1>
into a public, and for that reason, the parties may use this
document in the public session.
MR. KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. President. The question has been answered -- asked
and answered, but for the record and for the public, it is your
memo of 27 September to all parties. And in paragraph 2, the
Chamber refers to an email sent to WESU, on the 1st of September
2016, by Robert Lemkin. Let me quote from this:
"Thank you. Thanks for your emails. For reasons given many times
to the Court previously, I cannot accede to either request,
disclose the identity of W4 and provide the request footage."
And then it comes:
"With regard to your second, more recent set of requests, In
Thoeun and Chiel Chhoeun are incorrectly named on pages 104 and
106, respectively, of 'Behind the Killing Fields', a book I had
nothing to do with. I was careful to say that W1 in my earlier
notes was person (sic) named as In Thoeun on .
That is not his real name, and I'm not free to divulge his real
name. However, the investigation units has been provided with so
many clues, I'm sure they can make their own inquiries." End of
quote.
And for the record, Mr. President, if one reads the actual quote,
in the opinion of the Defence there can be no misunderstanding as
to the "Chhoeun", that Chan Savuth is regarding to, namely, not
this Choeun, who is testifying today, but the Chhorn who was
division commander 1 and whose name we can see not only in the
OCIJ list, but also on that organogram.
MR. KOUMJIAN:
Well, there's a time for argument, I think that's at the end of
the case. But counsel's theory is unsupported. The person he
talked about on the OCIJ list is named Uk Chhoeung, a completely
different name.
So I understand that he's not happy with what the witness has
said, but what we know is that what's said in the book, this
witness, Cheal Choeun, did not say.
MR. KOPPE:
Again, it's not terribly important, but the public should know
that the person who interviewed both Chan Savuth and also this
witness, is very clear that Chan Savuth is not speaking about him
being a division commander, but obviously about the real Division
1 commander.
Having said that, Mr. President, let me -- let me move on to my
next point.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please hold on, counsel Koppe.
And Judge Lavergne, you have the floor.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Whom are you referring to, Counsel Koppe, when you're speaking
about the person who interviewed the witness who is here in the
courtroom today? Are you referring to Thet Sambath or to Rob
Lemkin?
MR. KOPPE:
Both of them worked together. This witness --
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Listen, Counsel Koppe, as far as I know, I believe that the video
excerpts that were screened last Thursday concerned a meeting
that took place in Thailand. And regarding this meeting, it
appears to me that <it is very clear that> the witness said that
Rob Lemkin was not present, so I do not know how you can say <or
draw the conclusion> that Rob Lemkin interviewed this witness.
So can you please clarify?
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. I'm not entirely sure, Mr. Witness, what, exactly, you said
about your cooperation with Sambath and Lemkin, but let me ask
you to be -- to be very clear.
Can you tell us how many times you accompanied Lemkin and Sambath
on their trips, if at all, and were you, yourself ever
interviewed by one of them?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. He never interviewed me. However, he went together with Thet
Sambath when we went to Thailand.
Q. So--
MR. KOUMJIAN:
Yes, if I could just bring to, Your Honour's, attention and Mr.
Koppe's attention, in regards to his theory that the person that
Thet Sambath and Rob Lemkin interviewed and quote on  of
"Behind the Killing Fields" was Uk Chhoeung, number 6336 on the
OCIJ list, Counsel may also refer to document  at
English 00873643. Number 110 on that list of the persons --
prisoners smashed on 18 October 1977, was Uk Chhoeun.
So I guess Counsel's theory is that they interviewed a man who
was killed in S-21. I think the movie was made long after 1979.
MR. KOPPE:
If you had paid a bit attention as to what I actually said, Mr.
Prosecution, I know that also Lemkin and Thet Sambath cannot
interview people who are dead. They interviewed Chan Savuth. Chan
Savuth is the head of the hospital in region Battambang,
according to the book. That's correct.
It says, "Ros Nhim instructed Chiel Chhoeun, a division
commander, to contact the Thai communists."
Now, in the book, it's -- that's our position, and we have
convincing evidence for it. It's not this Choeun but is, in fact,
division commander Chhoeun, the one that I just referred to. And
that person is, indeed, dead because he features on the OCIJ
list.
So obviously, Sambath and Lemkin have not been able to interview
Chhoeun, who was Division 1 commander, but they interviewed Chan
Savuth, who, in his turn, referred to Chhoeun. And the English --
Thet Sambath doesn't speak English, and the English writer, Gina
Chon, mixed up this Choeun with Division 1 commander Chhoeun.
That's what happened and, to us, it's crystal clear.
MR. KOUMJIAN:
Excuse me. Counsel has now testified that Thet Sambath does not
speak English. In the movie, he's speaking English throughout the
film.
JUDGE FENZ:
And you have also testified what you think what mistake was made.
Can we stop the pleading?
The facts are here. The relevant documents are here. The Chamber
will make up its mind.
MR. KOPPE:
This--
JUDGE FENZ:
We can plead at a later stage.
MR. KOPPE:
This is what the Prosecution does all the time when they actually
read S-21 documents. That's what they do all the time.
JUDGE FENZ:
And we have allowed it for some time now, as you might have
noticed.
BY MR. KOPPE:
So it was -- it was an objection, and a wrongful objection.
Q. Mr. Witness, let me return to my question.
You said you were never interviewed by Lemkin and Sambath. Can
you tell us on how many trips you went with them? Was it only the
one time to Thailand, or did you accompany them on more trips?
MR. CHEAL CHOEUN:
A. I went with them to Thailand for one time, and we did not go
anywhere else. However, when they came to my area, they
questioned me of the locations that they could conduct their
shooting, and I showed them the surrounding locations where they
could do their filming.
And after I told them, then they asked me to take them to the
locations, and usually those locations were between 200 to 300
metres from where I lived. And that's where they shot their film.
And besides that, I did not accompany them anywhere else. The
only trip that I made with them was to Thailand.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness.
Before I move to my last subject, one follow-up question in
relation to your work at the railway station, that the
Prosecution seems to be interested in, you talked about trains
that you offloaded or helped offload. Can you tell us where the
trains were coming from and for whom the cargo was meant?
A. In fact, I did not assist in offloading the cargo. However, I
was there. I was repairing the railroad, and I saw the train
coming from Phnom Penh direction. And it carried goods, namely,
cement.
And people from the commerce section actually carried those
cements into the warehouse. Our group did not involve in the
carrying of those goods.
Our work was to build the railroad there, and I saw what
happening. For cement, sometimes they were offloaded from the
train wagons and upload them onto trucks, and the trucks were
driven away. And at other times, it was stocked in a nearby
warehouse.
Q. But just to be sure, you did not know from which unit or zone
the goods were coming from and for whom they were ultimately
destined. Is that correct?
A. I did not know about that.
MR. KOPPE:
Yes. And now, Mr. President, I suppose we have to close the doors
because I'm moving to an excerpt from the testimony of TCW-10600
(sic) -- something.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber will proceed <> in camera hearing. AV Unit, please
disconnect audio and video the public gallery as well as to the
press room or to staff member of the ECCC via internal
distribution except those staff who are involved directly with
the proceedings who should be entitled to see and hear what is
going on next.
(Suspension of public session 1117H)
(Closed session from 1118 to 1122H
(Resumption of public session 1122H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'd like now to hand the floor to the defence team for Khieu
Samphan.
MS. GUISSE:
Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning to all of you.
Simply to let you know that we're going to stand <by> our
position, which we described when Judge Lavergne put questions to
the witness, and we believe that there's very, very little
connection between this witness and Case 002/02. Therefore, we
have no <additional> questions to put to this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, counsel.
And Mr. Cheal Choeun, the Chamber is grateful of your testimony.
That is now the conclusion of your testimony, and we hope that
your testimony may contribute to ascertainment of the truth in
this case.
You are now excused, and you may return to your residence. We
wish you all the very best.
And Sok Socheata, the duty counsel, the Chamber is also grateful
of your assistance. You are no longer required to be present in
the courtroom.
Court officer, please work with WESU to arrange Mr. Cheal Choeun
to return to his residence or wherever he wishes to return to.
It is also now appropriate for the lunch break. The Chamber will
take a lunch break now and resume at 1.30 this afternoon to
continue our proceedings.
Security personnel, you are instructed to take Khieu Samphan to
the waiting room downstairs and have him returned to attend the
proceedings this afternoon before 1.30.
The Court stands in recess.
(Court recesses from 1124H to1331H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Chamber is now back in session.
The hearing in this session, the Chamber begin to hear testimony
of <the witness> 2-TCW-1037. And before we invite the witness
into the courtroom, the Chamber issues an oral ruling on Internal
Rules 87.3 and 4, related to the request made during the trial
hearings. The Chamber refers to the requested filed
confidentially by the Nuon Chea Defence pursuant to Internal Rule
87.4 and 93, document E445/1, put on 11 October 2016 <as
confidential document>, seeking the admission of eight documents
and requesting investigative action with respect to two
documents. Oral submissions in response were heard on 13 October
2016.
Pursuant to Internal Rule 87.4, the Trial Chamber admits
documents 1 to 7 and denies the admission of document 8. Given
that the Chamber denies the admission of document 8, the request
in response made by the Co-Prosecutor to admit <other> three
documents is moot.
With respect to document 1, the Nuon Chea Defence is instructed
to identify those portions of the 215-page document which are
most relevant to the anticipated testimony of 2-TCE-98 and which
they intend to use.
Having regard to the Rule 93 request, the Chamber has asked WESU
to contact the expert to provide a full version of the first
requested document.
The Chamber denies the Rule 93 request with respect to the second
requested document.
Full written reasons for this decision will follow in due course.
Now the Chamber will hear the testimony of 2-TCW-1037. And the
duty counsel is Mr. Moeurn Sovann.
The Chamber notes that this witness is part of another separate
<and ongoing> case. Therefore, the <International
Co-Investigating Judges> categorized the witness in Category
"Kor" <of the three categories> in its memorandum E319/35 <and
requested that> a pseudonym <should be used> for this witness in
order to protect the confidentiality <of the investigation>.
Therefore, the Chamber need to balance between the integrity of
the investigations and the public discussions in this trial. And
the Chamber also would like to remind parties to stick to the
principle in this document E319/7 <in using documents from other
cases>.
And court officer, please usher the witness, together with his
duty counsel, Moeurn Sovann, into the courtroom.
(Witness enters the courtroom)
QUESTIONING BY THE PRESIDENT:
Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. In this Trial Chamber, based on
the request by the Judges of the International Co-Investigating
Judges, the Chamber will use pseudonym to address you. Parties
will address you by your status as a witness, 2-TCW-1037. And the
Chamber prohibits all parties to address you by your <given and
surname> name <publicly in the hearing>.
Court officer, please bring document <> E3/9580 to the witness
<for review>.
Mr. Witness, the Chamber would like you to identify your
identities in document E3/9580. In Khmer, ERN 00951901; and
English, <00978416, in French, 01004431> . And I would like you
to look at the highlighted parts <in orange> about your <given>
name, <family name, nationality, place of birth> your occupation,
your date of birth, your parents' names, your wife's name and the
number of your children, whether this information <is> correct.
You simply give us the answer whether it's correct or not. That's
it.
And you have the document in your hand now and you can have a
look at those highlighted parts. <Is that correct?>
2-TCW-1037:
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. Thank you. And based on the greffier report this morning, that
based on your knowledge, you have no relationships by law or by
blood to the two accused, that is, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan,
and to any of the civil party admitted in this case. Is this
information correct?
A. Yes, that's correct.
Q. Please put the document aside because we don't use them now.
Mr. Witness, have you already taken an oath before the Iron Club
Statue before you come into this courtroom?
A. Yes, I have.
Q. Now we would like to inform you about your rights and
obligations as a witness in this courtroom.
Your rights: As a witness in the proceeding before the Chamber,
you may refuse to respond to any questions or to make any
comment, which may incriminate you; that is your right against
self-incrimination. This means that you may refuse to provide
your response or make any comment that could lead you to being
prosecuted.
Your obligations: As a witness in the proceedings before the
Chamber, you must respond to any questions by the Bench or
relevant parties, except where your response or comment to those
questions may incriminate you, as the Chamber has just informed
you of your rights as a witness.
You must tell the truth that you have known, heard, seen,
remembered, experienced, or observed directly about an event or
occurrence relevant to the questions that the Bench or parties
pose to you.
Mr. Witness, have you ever provided interviews to the
investigator from the OCIJ? And if you have, how many times and
where?
A. I provided the interviews with the investigator at my home.
Q. How many times that you gave the interviews to the
investigator?
A. Twice.
Q. Thank you. Before you come into this courtroom, have you
already reviewed the interviews that you provided to the
investigators <at your home> in order to jog your memory?
A. I cannot recall everything because it happened a long time
ago. I can recall only the important points, not all.
Q. Thank you. Based on your recollection, can you tell us whether
the interview statement that you have reviewed is consistent with
your interview that you provided at your home to the
investigator?
A. The answers I provided during the investigation process, based
on my review, they are slightly different; especially about the
exact dates and year, I cannot recall them well, so there are
some small discrepancies.
Q. Thank you. Pursuant to Rule 91bis, the Chamber give the floor
to the Nuon Chea defence team to put questions to this witness
first and the Nuon Chea defence team and the Khieu Samphan
defence team, the combined time for you both are two sessions.
QUESTIONING BY MR. KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. President, good afternoon. Good afternoon, Mr.
Witness. I'm the International Counsel for Nuon Chea and I would
like to ask you some questions this afternoon.
Q. Just one introductory question; you said you were interviewed
twice by investigators, is it correct that in 2013, you were
interviewed by investigators of this Court and that in 2006, you
were interviewed by representatives from an organization called
DC-Cam; is that correct?
2-TCW-1037:
A. Yes, that's correct.
Q. Thank you. Let me start by asking you, if you can tell the
Court, when it was that you joined the revolution?
A. Based on my recollection, I joined the revolution in 1970 and
I remained in the revolution until 1975 - until <the liberation
day,> 17 April 1975.
Q. Can you tell us what you did before 17 April '75, which
positions that you held, where you were stationed, etc.?
A. To my recollection, in 1970 to 1975, initially I joined the
army to liberate the nation and three years later, I left the
army and I received a new responsibility in charge of the
logistic and economy of the zone.
Q. And when was it exactly that you became or that you started
working for the logistics and economic section of the Northwest
Zone?
A. I started working in that role from 1973 onward.
Q. What were your functions while you were working at the
logistics and economics department of the zone; what -- what did
you do?
A. My main responsibility was in charge of controlling the food
and the ammunition. It was at the zone department of logistic and
economic section.
Q. Is it correct that at one point in time, you also became the
chairman of the logistics and economics unit of the Northwest
Zone?
A. I was not the chief. I was only in the role of distributing
food and clothes and ammunition to people at the battlefield.
Q. Maybe there's something not correct in the interpretation of
your -- of today or in your WRI; I'm not quite sure, but let me
read to you what you said in your WRI E3/9580, question and
answer 2.
You say, "I joined the Khmer Rouge as a soldier in 1970. By 1973,
I no longer went to battlefields since I was chairman of
logistics and economics of the Northwest Military Zone. I was
still in that position until 17 April '75, but I had moved to
live in Phsar Leu market in Battambang provincial town; is that
-- is that correct what you said to the investigator?
A. I said so during the investigation interviews with me, but I
would like to clarify that I was not the chairman. I was simply a
chief of a section that <was> responsible for sending the food,
clothes, and ammunition to the battlefield. For the logistic and
economic department, it was <> a separate entity that belonged to
the zone general staff.
Q. Let me follow up on this. Is it correct that when you were
working in logistics and economics and -- and delivering
ammunition and weapons to soldiers, that you were attached to a
division which was later to be called Division 2?
A. Yes, that's correct.
Q. Can you tell us who your direct commander was, or your direct
chief, while you were at Division 2?
A. The commander of the division, Division 2, was Ren.
Q. And -- sorry, please go ahead.
A. And there was another person, Ta Ham and also Ta Khleng. They
were <> chiefs of the general staff <> of Division 2.
Q. Do you know whether there was also a deputy secretary in
Division 2 named -- named Khoy or Keu (phonetic), Khue
(phonetic)?
A. I heard the name, but I was not sure whether he was based
there or not.
MR. KOPPE:
Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to show that same --
very same document again that I showed earlier this morning to
the other witness; that is, E3/1170 which is an organogram of the
two Northwest Zone divisions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your request is granted.
(Short pause)
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. Mr. Witness, are you -- are you able to read what's written
there?
2-TCW-1037:
A. Yes, I see it.
Q. In the--
MR. BOYLE:
Sorry, just for clarification, can I have the English ERN of the
-- the page that he is looking at?
BY MR. KOPPE:
Oh, I, yes, I apologize. That's 00602544; Khmer, 00443016;
French, 06544895.
Q. Mr. Witness, talking about Division 2, of which you were a
member, you can see three names as the commanders; Khleng, Khoy
or Khue (phonetic) maybe, and Ren; do you see those three names?
A. Yes, I see those three names.
Q. And that second name, does that ring a bell to you; is that
the same person that we just discussed?
A. I recall Khoy, but I do not know what position he held at that
time and for Khleng and Ren, I <remember their faces> clearly and
there was another person by the name Ham.
Q. We -- we will be discussing Ham shortly, but let -- let's --
let's stay on this overview first. When -- when you go down a
bit, you see Regiment 7-0, 70, and there we see the names Ren,
Roeut, and Se; is that the Ren that you mentioned and is that the
same Ren as the -- the Ren who was also a commander?
A. Ren was in the division headquarter and for Roeut, as far as I
know, he was in the regiment.
Q. Did you say Roeun (phonetic) or Roeut?
A. Roeut. To my recollection, he was the regiment chief of
Division 2.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. Let me now ask you to go to the other
side of that same page. There you see the Division 1 commanders.
We can see the name Norng Sarim, alias San, the deputy secretary,
if I pronounce it well, Neou, and the member of the Division 1
Committee, Chhorn -- Chhorn. Do you see these three names and if
yes, do these names sound familiar to you; do you remember those
names, those people?
A. Yes, I saw the names, but I am familiar only with one name;
that is, Chhorn and another one is Sarim. I knew them, but I do
not know what positions they held at that time.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. Now, are you able to tell us where in
the Northwest Division 2, your division, was stationed or based
and where in the Northwest Zone Division 1 had its headquarters
and was based?
A. To my knowledge, the 1st and 2nd Division headquarters, at the
time, as for the soldiers of Division 1, were located along
National Road Number 5 in Poipet area; as soldiers for Division
2, they were based along the former National Road Number 10; that
is, at the Provincial City of Battambang and that straight to
Pailin.
As for the division headquarter, it was located at Traeng
<commune> in Rotonak Mondol district.
Q. Let me follow up on this and let me lead you to your answers
-- your answer in your WRI, E3/9580 to the question 46. You said,
in that answer, that the major base of Division 2 was in Traeng
commune, Samlout district, presently Rotonak Mondol district,
correct?
A. After 1975, I saw the commanders of a division as well as
commanders of battalions and regiments, held their meetings there
at that location.
Q. Thank you. But now if you have a look again at that organogram
that I showed you, it says that Ren's base was in Pailin and
Roeut's base was in Kreng (sic), K-R-E-N-G; were there also bases
in Pailin and Kreng (sic)?
A. What I want to say is that I did not know the locations of
regiments; however, soldiers of Division 2 were at Battambang, at
a sugar factory <Kampong Kol>, <Traeng, and>  Pailin, etc.
Q. And Division 1 was, if I understand you correctly, among other
places, at Thma Koul along National Road 5; is that correct?
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. Now, I have two additional geographical questions. Mr.
Witness, have you ever heard of a place called Traeng -- Phsar
Traeng?
A. Phsar Traeng, during the time before 1975, was a town where
there was a market; that is Phsar.
Q. Do you know whether Division 1 or Division 2 ever held
meetings at Phsar Traeng?
A. To my understanding, <the meetings> were held at regimental or
divisional levels at Battambang and Traeng; however, the
headquarter of the staff zones was located at Battambang.
Q. And my -- my second geographical question or actually I have
another one, but Sdau village; do you know that?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Do you know whether there were ever meetings held in Sdau
village?
A. I did not know at the time. I only knew the major areas where
soldiers were stationed.
Q. Very well and then my -- my last geographical question, Mr.
Witness, Vay Chap mountain; do you know where that is?
A. Yes, I do; I know Vay Chap mountain. Currently Vay Chap
mountain is located in Rotonak Mondol district. At the time, it
also had a division area in Vay Chap mountain and it was also a
military training base for that division.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. Now, let me turn to the person that
you just refer to, Ham, Ta Ham; who was he and what was his
function before and after 1975?
A. Before 1975, Ham was in charge of the sector army. Later on,
he was transferred to the zone army. As for his actual position,
he was deputy of <Ta> Khleng.
Q. Did -- did Ham have a function in -- in relation to logistics,
the logistics of the zone?
A. He also controlled the logistics <of that zone>.
MR. KOPPE:
Then I -- I -- I'm almost certain we speak about the same person,
but just to be absolutely sure, Mr. Witness.
Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to show that same
photo from the ECCC website that I showed earlier to the -- to a
previous witness from the Northwest Zone, the -- the bodyguard of
Ros Nhim. It's, I believe, admitted now into evidence. It's the
photo that is attached to the draft transcript of 21 September
2016. I'm not at liberty to say the name of that witness; it's
2-TCW-1036 and the photo was shown at 11.23 in the morning.
JUDGE FENZ:
And probably has a number by now, but--
MR. KOPPE:
We -- we checked, but we -- we couldn't find it. So with your
leave, Mr. -- Mr. President. And we can also, with your leave,
put it on the screen.
JUDGE FENZ:
And again, attach it to the transcript so we have it.
MR. KOPPE:
Yes, please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can proceed and AV Unit, please show the photo on the
screen per the Defence Counsel's request and allow me to say that
this photo is E3/10698.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. Mr. Witness, can you have a look at the photo or at the screen
if -- if you prefer? Is this the Ham that you spoke about?
2-TCW-1037:
A. No, he's not.
Q. That's an answer I hadn't expected. Let -- let me -- let me
ask another question. Do you recognize the -- the person on the
photo?
A. No, I don't <know this person.>
Q. The Ta Ham that you just spoke about and who you also
mentioned frequently in your WRI, do you know if he's still
alive?
A. To the best of my knowledge and based on the information that
I received, in 1977, towards the end of the year, Ham was
arrested by Pol Pot, but I did not know where he was taken to.
Q. Does this mean you believe that Ham is not alive anymore?
A. Yes, I believe that he's not alive.
Q. Let me see if I can try it differently. Do you know a person
named Toit -- Toit Thoeurn?
A. Is it Toit Thut (phonetic) or Toit Theut (phonetic)?
Q. That's a good question.
JUDGE FENZ:
Perhaps, your Khmer colleague can pronounce it.
MR. LIV SOVANNA:
The name is Toit Theut (phonetic).
2-TCW-1037:
A. At my site, there was a Toit Theut (phonetic); however, he's
dead. He used to have quite a senior position and he passed away
less than a year ago.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. Yes, as a matter of fact, a few months ago. Was -- was -- the
Toit Theut (phonetic) that you speak about, was he a general in
-- in the Cambodian -- in the -- in the present Cambodian army?
2-TCW-1037:
A. Yes, that is true.
Q. And the person I just -- just to make sure I understand it.
The photo -- the person on -- on the photo is not Toit Theut
(phonetic)? Maybe I'm -- I'm getting confused myself now, but--
MR. BOYLE:
When the -- when the photo was originally placed to the witness,
he was asked about whether it was the Ham that he knew, so--
MR. KOPPE:
Right.
MR. BOYLE:
--so you might get a different answer from whether it's Toit
Theut (phonetic).
BY MR. KOPPE:
I will rephrase, thank you.
Q. The person that you just saw in the photo, it's not Toit Theut
(phonetic), the general, correct?
2-TCW-1037:
A. Are you referring to the photo before me?
Q. Yes.
A. The person looks similar to me because Toit Theut (phonetic)
that I knew, he had a darker complexion, but the facial shape
looks similar.
MR. BOYLE:
Just for the clarity of the record, the photograph is of an
individual by the name mentioned by Counsel that was identified
when he appeared before the Supreme Court Chamber and so I think
we have on record that it is -- you know, the photo is also of
when he appeared before the Supreme Court Chamber. So I -- I
think we have on record that it is the person by that name.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Sure, but there is also his testimony saying that he was Ham, the
person that worked for the military staff and who was -- who was
the chief of the logistics. So we might have a situation that the
person on the photo was saying he was Ham, but he wasn't in fact.
That's the problem.
But I don't have that much time; let -- let's move on. It's --
it's unclear and I might revisit this subject after the break,
Mr. Witness. It's very intriguing what you're saying.
Q. Let me move on to another person that you speak -- just spoke
about, Ta Khleng. He was the chief of the military staff of the
Northwest Zone; is that correct?
2-TCW-1037:
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. In your testimony, for instance, at -- in your DC-Cam
statement, you speak about another person called Ta Vanh; who was
Ta Vanh?
A. The name Ta Vann (phonetic) does not sound familiar.
Q. Maybe it's my -- my pronunciation which is not very good,
still, after all those years. Mr. Witness, you said in E3/10666
in your DC-Cam statement at English, ERN 01330497; I don't
believe there is a French ERN; but there is a Khmer ERN which is
01326301. You said, "Early 1977, they arrested Ta Vanh who was
chief of commerce. They accused him of arming a soldier to attack
Angkar"
So maybe my pronunciation was incorrect, but that's the Ta Vanh
I'm speaking about.
A. Yes, I recognize this person. He is not Ta Vann (phonetic),
but his name is Ta Vanh.
Q. There you have it. And is he the same person that you refer to
also in your DC-Cam statement on English ERN 01330517 and Khmer
01326314 where you say, "Ta Vanh, Ta Vanh" -- excuse me --
"supervised both the army and the sector too"?
A. To my knowledge, before the liberation year of 1975, he was a
part of a sector committee; that is, Sector 2 Committee. He was
not in charge of the military.
Q. Very well. Then let me move on to two other important people
from the Northwest Zone; first, Ros Nhim, the chief of the zone.
You speak about him, Ta Nhim, being the zone secretary; did you
know Ta Nhim personally? Did you ever meet him in person?
A. Yes, I saw him in person and I used to attend political study
session at the political school with him for one or two
occasions.
Q. One -- one side-quote question, I suppose, Mr. Witness, have
you ever seen a photograph of Ros Nhim after 1975 anywhere?
A. No, I haven't since I parted ways from him. We heard that he
was murdered by Pol Pot as there was no photo of him remained. <I
have never seen his photo.>
Q. Thank you. And then my final question in relation to the
Northwest Zone structure; that's another person that you speak
about a few times, -- and I hope I pronounce it correctly -- Ta
Heng Teav, alias Ta Paet; do you know who he was and did you ever
meet him personally?
A. The name is not Heng Teab (phonetic), but Heng Teav, alias
Paet. I knew him and I knew him since the war period; that is,
before 1975.
Q. Thank you. Mr. Witness, let me return to Ta Ham, whom you
called in question and answer 28 of E3/9580, the deputy of the
zone military general staff, the deputy to Ta Khleng. You just
mentioned Ta Ham was arrested in 1977; do you know why he was
arrested?
A. From what I knew, the cadres who were in the leadership in the
zone military, were accused of having connection with the CIA. As
for him, he was accused of colluding in transporting firearms and
ammunition to hide them for the purpose of attacking and this
information, I obtained from some of the people I knew in the
army.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. Let me -- let me read to you what you
told the investigator in relation to Ta Ham's arrest. In question
and answer 29, you said the following.
"Ta Ham was also arrested. They were arrested together. I
obtained information that both divisions of the Northwest Zone
had planned to fight back against Pol Pot, but this plan had been
leaked through some agents of the Centre. That was why the
military people were arrested. Ta Ham was accused of having
transported military equipment to Phnom Vay Chap mountain. I
learned about this, after 1979, from a driver who had transported
the equipment in question. Another soldier told me of a hearing
their leaders say in a meeting" -- sorry -- "Another soldier told
me of hearing their leaders say in a meeting, that if nothing was
done about the Northwest group, the zone would revolt like the
East Zone." End of quote.
Is this what you told the investigators of the International
Co-Investigating Judge; is that what you told him? Is the -- is
the excerpt correct?
MR. BOYLE:
I object to the form of the question. It's compound. You can ask
him if that's what he told them and then you could ask him if
it's correct, but as asked; it might be a confusing answer for
the record.
BY MR. KOPPE:
No problem in rephrasing.
Q. Mr. Witness, is this what you've told the investigators?
2-TCW-1037:
A. Yes, that's what I told the investigator.
Q. Let me now go to the details of this particular answer. Let me
first ask you a question about the driver that you speak about;
the driver who told you after 1979, that he had transported the
equipment from Ta Ham -- the military equipment -- to Phnom Vay
Chap. Who was this driver?
A. To my knowledge, the driver was the person who lived with him
and who was also a driver and he was his close confidante. But at
present, I do not know his whereabouts; I haven't seen him.
Q. Do you know his name?
A. Yes, I know the driver's name.
Q. And would you be willing to tell us his name?
A. Yes, I can tell his name. His name is San (phonetic), but as I
told you earlier, he has disappeared. He has disappeared since
1979, 1980. I met him once in Snoeng village in Banan district.
Q. In -- in that answer that you have given to the investigators,
you said that the plan of both divisions of the Northwest Zone to
fight back against Pol Pot had been, "leaked through some agents
of the Centre." Can you expand on this; do you know how this plan
had been leaked and who are the agents of the Centre that you
refer to if you know?
A. <In relation> to this point, I learned about it through the
cadre who came to supervise the Northwest Zone. They were in the
military and they told us that they received the information from
the messenger and it was from <> Ta Nhim's messenger. The
messenger reported to the Centre and as a result, the plan <was
ruined> and <they were all arrested one by one from the Northwest
Zone>.
Q. And -- and who was this messenger of Ta Nhim?
A. Ta Nhim's messengers, I did not know them. <I was never with
them but> I saw four or five men who usually went out with him.
<I saw them each time I attended the study session.>
Q. And let -- let me follow up on this. You said you obtained
information that both divisions had planned to fight back against
Pol Pot; what were the -- the plans of -- of the divisions? What
were the divisions supposed to do; do you know any -- do you have
any concrete details as to what these two divisions were supposed
to be doing against Pol Pot?
A. Related to this point, I only learned about them later on.
They told me that the division had a plan for counterattacks, but
their plans were not materialized yet. They had not had a clear
structure or network to materialize the plan yet and when their
plan were found out, they were <arrested> continuously <in the
Northwest Zone by the forces from the Southwest Zone.>
I received the information that forces from the two divisions
were preparing for counterattacks on Pol Pot. It was just the
information that I received from the zone military.
Q. And -- and what do you mean when you say the zone military;
who -- who gave you this information?
A. The military force within the division told me about that plan
and they explained to me that was the reason behind the <arrest>
of <all> leaders <there>.
Q. Do you have a name of the person who told you?
A. I cannot recall the names because there were many people who
talked about that. I cannot identify any one of them and I don't
know where they live now. They were at my age, at that time, and
now I am 66, so I think it's a slim chance that they survive.
Q. I understand, but let me ask it more general. The persons who
gave you the information about the plan to fight back against Pol
Pot, were they, themselves, members of Division 1 and 2?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please hold on.
2-TCW-1037:
A. They were not the force of Division 1 and 2; they were the
coalition forces that were sent from the Southwest Zone and those
people told me about the plan.
Q. Okay. Then, in that same answer, you said -- you talked about
San (phonetic), the driver who had transported military equipment
to Phnom Vay Chap, but you also say, "Another soldier told me of
hearing their leader say in a meeting that if nothing was done
about the Northwest group, the zone would revolt like the East
Zone." Who is this soldier who heard Northwest Zone leaders say
that the zone would revolt like the East Zone?
MR. BOYLE:
The -- the question misrepresented the -- the answer. It -- it
was read correctly, but then he didn't say that he heard
Northwest Zone leaders discussing this; he said he heard leaders.
"If nothing was done about the Northwest group, the zone would
revolt" -- I'm sorry. He -- I'm sorry -- "Another soldier told me
of hearing their leaders --"
BY MR. KOPPE:
I will rephrase.
Q. Let -- let me read again exactly what you said and then I will
ask you the question. You said, "Another soldier told me of
hearing their leaders say in a meeting, that if nothing was done
about the Northwest group, the zone would revolt like the East
Zone." Who is this other soldier that you speak about?
2-TCW-1037:
A. Regarding that answer I gave, it seems to me that I cannot
recall it well now.
Q. Very well. Let me -- let me follow up on this subject and
refer you to something you said in your DC-Cam interview,
E3/10666; ERN English, 01330557; and Khmer, 01 -- 01326340. The
question is:
"According to what you know, they arrested Vanh, did he really
arrange weapons to attack Angkar?"
"I don't know about this, but as I heard, my colleagues told me
that he armed his forces illegally. He arranged and moved his
forces to prepare the weapons. He hid the weapons with the mobile
forces in order to attack back." End of quote.
Mr. Witness, who are these colleagues that you refer to; your
colleagues who told you that Ta Vanh armed his forces illegally?
MR. BOYLE:
It's -- it -- Mr. President, it seems we're moving on to a
different individual now. I just prefer that the questions be
open if we're going to be talking about the -- a different
individual's evidence to begin with.
BY MR. KOPPE:
I thought we were on the same subject, but well, it's an open
question; isn't it? I -- I read his answer and then I ask him:
Who are those colleagues? So I -- I'm not sure if I -- how I
should rephrase.
I'm following up. It's -- it's -- it seems the same subject, so
I'm asking who the colleagues are that told him that Vanh armed
his forces illegally, so that's an open question.
Q. Mr. Witness, who are those colleagues who told you this about
Vanh?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you can answer the question and I want to clarify
that the name was <Vanh, not> Vann (phonetic).
2-TCW-1037:
A. Yes, the name was Vanh, not Vann (phonetic). Vanh, during the
war years, before 1975, he was <chief of> the sector. Later on,
the zone assigned him to take control of Tanouk Trahot
(phonetic). Nowaday, <> the dam is also called Tanouk Trahot
(phonetic) or Trahot (phonetic) dam and at that worksite,
hundreds of people died at that time. Thousands of mobile forces
were assigned to work there and there were many failures in
building that dam.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It seems that you don't understand the question. I clarified
earlier that the name was Vanh, not Vann (phonetic), in order to
help you not to get confused among the different names.
The question that posed to you by the counsel was not about the
dam building, was not about the Trahot (phonetic) dam building.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Thank you for this intervention, Mr. President.
Q. My question is a simple one: Who were your colleagues who told
you about Vanh arming his forces illegally; who were they that
told you this?
2-TCW-1037:
A. The <person> who had told me <was> arrested and taken away.
His name was Ta Sum. Ta Sum told me that Ta Vanh <was arrested
because he> had illegally created force and armed those <mobile>
forces.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
It is now convenient time for a break. The Chamber will take a
break from now until 3 o'clock.
Court officer, please assist the witness at the waiting room for
witness during the break time and invite him back, together with
his duty counsel, into the courtroom at 3 o'clock.
The Court is now in recess.
(Court recesses from 1444H to 1504H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Court is now back in session and before I
hand the floor to the Defence Counsel, the Chamber would like to
ask the Co-Prosecutor if you wish to make any requests in
relation to our oral ruling?
MS. SONG CHORVOIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. In relation to your oral ruling to
E445/1 that the Chamber acknowledges to receive the thesis of the
expert 2-TCE-98, in <the thesis of the expert> at ERN in English,
01335031, the expert interviewed <the former King> Norodom
Sihanouk and Ieng Sary in 1983 and '85 respectively.
In those interviews, there were written notes by the expert and
the Co-Prosecutor, therefore, request the Trial Chamber to
instruct the expert, if <the expert> still <has> the hand written
notes available, to bring along during the testimony. The
Co-Prosecutors are of the view that those handwritten notes have
some important information and that may be evidence in assisting
the Chamber in finding the truth in this case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
JUDGE FENZ:
Can I just ask clarification; I just saw this only now. Is -- is
the Prosecution saying, first of all, that these interviews were
a basis or sources for the dissertation? That's my first question
or is it just mentioned somewhere?
MS. SONG CHORVOIN:
To respond to your question, Your Honour, we are not sure whether
the interviews are <necessary documents> for the writing of the
thesis of the expert, however, <> the book <which was written by
the expert>, that is, .1, at ERN in English, that is,
01335031; the author, who is the expert, spoke about an interview
that the expert conducted with the <former> King Norodom Sihanouk
and with Ieng Sary <on two different occasions>. And the expert
had the handwritten notes of the two interviews <with the ERN I
mentioned earlier> and for that reason, I believe the handwritten
notes contain some information and that we may ask the expert
during the testimony.
JUDGE FENZ:
Again, you are claiming this is a source of an admitted document;
I understood that correctly, the handwritten notes? My -- my
second question: The expert is already in the country. Let's, for
a moment, assume the handwritten notes are here; what's the idea,
to -- to show it to all the parties with a view to admit it or
for the expert to be able to ask questions or? The expert is
tomorrow -- scheduled for tomorrow.
MS. SONG CHORVOIN:
We are in the process of preparing detailed questions for the
expert and in the meanwhile, we would appreciate if the expert
would bring along the handwritten notes so that we may ask
question to the expert <about> the interview that the expert
conducted with <the former King> Norodom Sihanouk and Ieng Sary.
JUDGE FENZ:
The idea is to assist the expert's memory, is -- in -- in case
this is necessary, when it comes to the contents of interviews
that are mentioned in one of his publications, which we have
already admitted; is this one -- is this the reason for the
request?
MS. SONG CHORVOIN:
Yes, it is a <> way to assist the expert. Throughout the process
of questioning, maybe some questions may arise in relation to
those notes <when the expert gives a testimony>.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What about other parties; do you have any response to this
request by the Co-Prosecutor?
MR. PICH ANG:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. The Lead Co-Lawyers <have no
comment on the Co-Prosecutor's  request and> rely on the wisdom
of the Bench. Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. And what about the defence teams; do you wish to make
any observation in regard to the Co-Prosecutor's request?
MR. KOPPE:
Yes, I do, Mr. President. I'm not sure if I follow the request in
the sense: Why is this request coming now? Because the
dissertation is, if I speak by heart, written and defended, I
believe, in 1985 and 1986.
His book -- I'm not sure I have to review it, but in his book
that is from 1999, he also refers to his interviews with Ieng
Sary and -- and Sihanouk, so his book is further developing all
kinds of points made in his dissertation. So if it were the other
way around then -- then I -- I could see some sense in it, but
asking now for the notes is way too late because those notes of
the interviews were also -- I'm quite sure, but I have to -- to
double check it -- referred to in his book.
So what's new, what's very interesting in his book are his notes
that he took from the Soviet archives; that is new, but his
interview with Ieng Sary and -- and late king father in his
dissertation are also referred to in his -- in his 1999 book, so
the request doesn't make any sense.
JUDGE FENZ:
Not if it is preparation for an 87.4 request; that's why I tried
to ask. If it is only to, kind of, ensure that the expert
remembers details of interviews the Prosecution wants to discuss,
it -- it's a bit of a different issue, but that's what I tried to
clarify. You are on the record.
MS. GUISSE:
For the time being, Mr. President, I can only wait for the expert
to arrive. We <are asking> for documents whereas the expert is
already in the country. We are asking the expert to provide the
documents <whereas> we do not know <what exactly the
Co-Prosecutor will be questioning the party about, nor do we
know> whether <these documents> will be useful <to> the
manifestation of the truth. I think we can do what we did in the
past. If, <in> the Prosecution's line of questions, we find that
it <would be useful> to have supplementary notes in relation to
the expert's testimony, <then> we can make that request at the
time. I will reserve my remarks for the time being. It appears to
be rather premature <-- or even too late, I'm not sure --> to
make that request at this point in time.
MR. KOPPE:
Mr. President, if you allow me, I -- we have now found the
relevant English ERN of Morris' book of 1999, E3/7338 at English
ERN 01001662. He mentions his interview with king father, so
pretending that's something new is without any basis.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, parties, for the observation and the Chamber will use
it as a basis for our ruling, which will be issued in due course.
Defence Counsel, you may resume your questioning.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. President. I -- I do hope that these additional 15
or 20 minutes will be added to our time.
Q. Mr. Witness, before the break, you mentioned the person who
told you about Ta Vanh and you called him Sum; is that the same
person that you refer to in your answer 2, in your WRI E3/9580,
where you say:
"Around March or April '78, my unit chairman Ta Sum was arrested.
At that time, I was his deputy"? So the -- the Sum who told you
about Vanh preparing the weapons, is that Sum the one who was
arrested?
2-TCW-1037:
A. Yes, that is him.
Q. And did tell -- did Sum tell you how he knew that Vanh was
arming his forces illegally, hiding the weapons with the mobile
forces in order to attack back? How did Sum know Vanh was doing
this?
A. Regarding this matter, I did not know how he learned about it;
that's what he said. That is, he said after Vanh had been
arrested.
Q. And -- and do you recall some details; what did Sum tell you
about what Vanh had done exactly?
A. To my knowledge, regarding the activities involved, I made
mention of that and the reason for his arrest was that he was
accused of colluding with the mobile force and of equipping the
mobile force with weapons and those infiltrated people there knew
that it was an illegal act.
Q. I'm not asking you about what he was accused of; I'm asking
you what Sum told you he knew, from his own observations, what
exactly Vanh had been involved in.
MR. BOYLE:
I object to that question because the witness just told us that
he didn't know how Sum obtained his information, so to -- to say
-- to ask him what he knew from his own observations is outside
the scope of the Witness' knowledge.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Let -- let me -- let me rephrase; I'm not sure if I follow.
Q. But my -- my question is about the details; what did Vanh --
what had Vanh done according to Sum? Did Sum give you, for
instance, the location of weapons being hidden? Can you tell us
any more details as to what Sum told you Vanh had done?
2-TCW-1037:
A. I did not know any further detail. He said that Ta Vanh had
been arrested because he illegally equipped the mobile force and
that was the main point that he told me. He didn't say anything
much besides this.
Q. Very well. I stay on the same subject and would like to refer
you, now, to what you said to the DC-Cam investigators, E3/10666,
at English, ERN 01330580; and Khmer, 01326355. It's the same
subject; it's about divisions preparing their forces to attack.
This is what you said and -- and let me read it to you.
"After the liberation in 1975, the politics became chaotic. I was
very disappointed. There was nothing we could do. According to
what I know, some divisions prepared their forces to attack back
but they could not do so."
What did you mean, first of all, when you said the politics
became chaotic?
A. Regarding this matter, I wanted to say that the politics were
confusing <and> changing direction, and I knew to some extent
about the <top> leaders<>. For example, at the zone level, that
is, Ta Keu alias Ta Kan, who told me to be mindful because the
situation was not forgiving since the politics are changing. And
that is why I said there were always reasons for what happened.
Q. Did Ta Keu speak about -- speak to you about divisions being
prepared or divisions preparing their forces to attack Pol Pot?
A. No, he did not. He told me to be vigilant and be mindful due
to the changes in politics and that the situation <was not good>
as I could also see that people had been arrested here and there.
<I did not know anything beyond this.>
Q. A little bit further on the very same page, you say: "I don't
know where the plan was revealed."
And then you say: "At first, it could have been an open policy.
The Northwest Zone also arrested Northwest Zone cadres."
What did you mean when you said that to DC-Cam?
A. At the time, the Southwest people did not yet arrived in large
number. Some of them were present at some departments or offices
and I observed that northwest people arrested their own northwest
people, namely in the platoons or in the companies. And after the
northwest had arrested their own people, then the southwest
people started arresting the northwest people.
Q. I understand. Let me go back then to your answer to DC-Cam
when you say: "According to what I know, some divisions prepared
their forces to attack back."
Is that something you also knew at the time before the Southwest
Zone forces arrived?
A. After the Southwest group arrived at the Northwest Zone, that
<was> after those senior leaders at the sector zones and some
districts had all been arrested in the zone, so I learnt of this
information later on.
(Technical problem)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, please repeat your last response because the Khmer
channel did not carry your voice.
2-TCW-1037:
Allow me to repeat my last response. At that time, through what I
knew and what I saw, that is, after the senior leaders at the
zone and sector and district levels had been arrested, including
those military commanders at divisions and regimental levels, I
learnt of that information. So I learned after those arrests had
been made.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. I understand, but my question was, did you also know about
divisions preparing the forces to attack before the Southwest
Zone cadres arrived?
2-TCW-1037:
A. No, I did not.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Let me turn to another -- or the same subject but something in
relation to this, Mr. Witness.
Mr. President, I'll be referring to E3/4202, Thet Sambath's book,
ERN English, 00757532; Khmer, 00858342; and 00849437, in French.
Q. Mr. Witness, did you know a person named Chan Savuth who used
to be head of a hospital in the region in Battambang?
2-TCW-1037:
A. No, the name does not sound familiar to me.
Q. Let me read this particular excerpt:
"Chan Savuth, head of the hospital in his region in Battambang,
said in an interview that in one of the meetings he attended in
Sdau to overthrow Pol Pot, Ros Nhim said secrecy was mandatory
because anyone who was found to be part of the plot would surely
be killed."
Mr. Witness, have you ever heard plans to overthrow Pol Pot and
Ros Nhim talking at this meeting saying that secrecy was
mandatory?
A. No, I did not hear that.
Q. Did you ever hear -- did you ever hear things about Ros Nhim
ordering members of Division 1 or 2 to collect and hide rice,
weapons, hammocks, fish, in order to assist the troops who would
revolt against the Centre?
A. No, I did not hear that or see that.
Q. Did you ever hear anything about Northwest Zone division
troops hiding medicine in warehouses?
A. Regarding this point, I did not hear it, however, there was an
accusation that fuel was hidden or <> fuel was dumped into the
river.
Q. Again, you talk about accusations. Do you have any direct
information about Division 1 or 2 -- Division 2 members who were
involved in this plot?
A. No, because I lived separately and far away from them.
Q. Let me tell you why I'm a bit surprised to hear this, Mr.
Witness. Mr. President, I will be referring now to E3/1358,
that's a FBIS Report, English only, ERN 00168287.
This is a senior military figure from Thailand talking to the
international press, and there is a report from a French agency,
AFP, on 19 August 1977, saying the following:
"A senior Thai military figure Friday said Cambodia's leaders
suppressed an attempted coup in February this year. General
<Kriangsak Chamanan>, Deputy Supreme Commander, said the
Cambodian revolutionary organization Angkar crushed the attempt
which had been planned to coincide with the second anniversary of
the Khmer Rouge takeover on April 17 1965." -- it says here but
it's '75 -- "Apparently quoting Thai intelligence reports, the
general said the Cambodian leadership had foiled the plotters,
liquidating many of them and member of their families." End of
quote.
There are other reports mentioned in Kiernan, so apparently it
was quite well known in 1977, that in the Northwest a coup
d'etat, which was supposed to happen on 7 April '77, was crushed.
So do you understand my surprise?
MR. BOYLE:
I object. Thank you, Mr. President. I object to the question.
Counsel's testifying as to the evidence. If he wants to, as he
did, read the quote and ask some specific questions, that's fine.
If he has specific questions from Kiernan he would like to ask,
that's fine, but to testify as to what was well known or what the
evidence shows and to ask about why he's surprised isn't possibly
information that the witness would be able to give.
MR. KOPPE:
I'm not sure why I cannot ask this question. I mean, obviously--
JUDGE FENZ:
Because it -- Counsel, you just asked him -- you just asked him
if he understood that you were surprised after you had quoted an
intelligence report. This is not a factual question. Get down to
the facts.
As the prosecutor said, if you want to use this as a basis for
factual questions, do it, but his assessment of your surprise or
the level of your surprise is certainly not what the witness is
here for.
BY MR. KOPPE:
I'm not sure if I understand what you're saying.
Q. But, Mr. Witness, I just read an international news report
quoting a Thai general, so that went all over into the world,
saying that there was a plot, an attempted coup d'etat, was
supposed to take place at 17 April 1977. Have you heard something
similar while you were in the Northwest Zone being a member of
Division 2?
2-TCW-1037:
A. In that year, I did not hear about that plot. I heard about it
only later on after the military forces there were broken up and
<arrested>, at that point, I learned at the cooperatives about
such plots that you said earlier, about the plan for
counter-attacks.
Q. Well, let me read the first sentence of the next paragraph,
and please be reminded that this is what the general said in
August 1977:
"The putsch was mounted by administrative and military leaders
from an extensive swath of territory sweeping northwest from
Kampong Cham, which includes the provinces of Kampong Thom, Siem
Reap and Ourdor Meanchey."
I'll continue reading:
"Refugees from this area, who have recently entered Thailand,
hinted at the existence of strife in the Khmer Rouge ranks." End
of quote.
So, Mr. Witness, people like Ta Khleng, Ros Nhim, Ta Khieu
(phonetic), they were all arrested about eight months later.
Did you know about this before Ros Nhim was arrested? What -- can
you -- let me re-phrase. Can you recall what you knew before Ros
Nhim was arrested in relation to attempted coup d'etats or
military attacks?
A. At that time, I did not know because I was based at the river.
I <supervised> the fishing unit. There were around 300 or 400
people at the fishing unit, and we were not informed about the
developing situation.
My force in the fishing unit <was> also <under the surveillance
of> the <secret> agents deployed by the senior leaders<>, so we
were not informed about such plan.
Q. Very well. Let me follow-up with another question.
Mr. President, I would like to show the witness a photograph. We
wrote an email earlier to the senior legal officer. I would like
to show and with your leave, also on the screen, three people on
photo E3/3481, ERN is P00440815.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber grants your request.
AV Unit officer, please project the photo on the screen.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. Mr. Witness, do you know who the person on the right is?
2-TCW-1037:
A. No, I do not know him.
Q. Have you ever heard of a Standing Committee Member or Central
Committee Member called Vorn Vet?
A. No, I did not hear about his name. <I did not know the Central
Committee.>
Q. Then I assume that also means that you never heard of Vorn Vet
joining a meeting during which Ta Nhim instructed his division
commanders to rebel; correct?
A. I never attended any meeting.
Q. Have you ever heard of So Phim?
A. For So Phim, I heard of his name, but it seems to me that I
met him once when he was travelling by speedboat from <Phsar Leu>
to Tonle Sap. He traveled along with Ta Nhim <before Ta Nhim was
arrested>. They made visits to bases along Tonle Sap.
Q. Did you ever see Ta Nhim and So Phim together?
A. At that time, I did not know how many days they spent there,
but I saw them travelling together by the boat in Tonle Sap.
Q. And do you know what the reason was that they were travelling
together?
A. No, I did not know the reason. At that time, the zone's
general staff informed us to prepare boats and ferries, put them
in good order, park them along the riverbank because the
leadership would make visits along the river. And that was what I
know.
Q. In your question and answer -- you -- answer A6, E3/9580, you
say that Ta Nhim was arrested at the same time as the Secretary
of the East Zone, So Phim. How did you know that?
A. At that time, I saw them travelling together for one and two
days. That was the only time I saw them and, after that, So Phim
disappeared. And a while later, I also heard that Ta Nhim was
also arrested. And that was the scope of the events that I knew.
Q. I understand. Now, let me revisit the person that we discussed
before the break.
I showed you a photo on the screen and I'm not sure if you
recognized the photo. Your duty counsel is kind enough to show
you the photo again.
Mr. Witness, in your DC-Cam statement, E3/10666, English, ERN
01330510; in Khmer 01326309, you talk about Ta Toat. You said --
the question is:
"What was the name of the leader supervising the Vay Chap
mountain base?"
"His name was Ta Toat."
Q. Is the Ta Toat that you refer to in your DC-Cam statement
maybe the same person as on that photo?
A. Are you talking about Ta Toit or Ta Toat?
Q. Ta Toat, I think. Ta Toat.
JUDGE FENZ:
I think it's preferable if you pronounced like Khmer speak it.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. Ta Toat. Let me, because of time, do it differently.
You're talking about a person supervising the Vay Chap mountain
base, Ta Toat. Is the Ta Toat who is supervising the Vay Chap
mountain the same as the person on the photo?
2-TCW-1037:
A. Ta Toit (phonetic) was <Toit> Thoeurn's father. I suspected
that it was Ta Toit <Thoeurn (sic)> because when he died he
looked older than the one in this photo. The one in the photo
looks younger <and fairer>.
Q. Forget about a name, but the person you say who supervised the
Vay Chap mountain base, is that the same person as the person on
the photo?
A. Ta Toit (phonetic), during the war year in the 1970 to 1973,
he was supervising Khmer Rouge base at Vay Chap Mountain. Ta Toit
(phonetic) supervised the forces based at that mountain but,
later on, he did not supervise anything because he died a long
time ago.
BY MR. KOPPE:
But that brings me, Mr. President, to something that I think I
should say for the record.
We already had some doubts, some potential doubts, as to who the
person was that has testified in June 2015, before the Supreme
Court Chamber, but in the light of the testimony of today's
witness and also the previous witness we are doubting now that
the person on the photo is, in fact, Toat or Ham. Having said
that, let me move to my final question.
Q. Mr. Witness, in your WRI you speak about the White Khmer, the
Khmer Sar. Who are they?
2-TCW-1037:
A. To my knowledge, the Khmer Sar or White Khmer were those who
escaped from cooperatives who tried to flee from the regime into
the jungle and they gathered up forces in order to fight back
against the three years regime, especially fighting against the
Southwest force because the Southwest force was considered as the
life and death enemy. <I knew that any> soldiers from the
Southwest force who were arrested would not be spared, <their
throats> would be <slit>.
Q. And the people that you refer to as Khmer Sar, White Khmer,
are not the same as Division 1 or 2 soldiers. Is that correct?
MR. BOYLE:
I object to the question. First of all, I believe it's leading
and, second of all, I'm not sure if that's what he just testified
to. So I would just ask if Counsel asked a more open question in
regards to these soldiers that the witness says formed part of
the Khmer Sar movement.
BY MR. KOPPE:
I'll be happy to rephrase.
Q. Mr. Witness, you belong -- you, yourself, belong to Division
2. Did soldiers belonging to Division 2 or soldiers belonging to
Division 1 belong to the White Khmer? Were they, themselves,
considered White Khmer or was it only the people who left the
mobile brigades?
2-TCW-1037:
A. To my knowledge, at that time the Khmer Sar were created. Each
group consisted of around -- between four and 10 men. The forces
<were the mixture of> people who left the <17,> 18 April People
group and some also came from the division of the military.
Q. Unfortunately, my very last question, Mr. Witness. That is a
question that is about the structure of Division 1 and 2. You
talked about your Commanders, Khleng and Ren, but I believe you
also said you knew the Division 1 Commander, Chhorn. Is that
correct?
MR. LIV SOVANNA:
Mr. President, I would like to read in Khmer. The Commander of
Division 1, his name is Chhorn.
BY MR. KOPPE:
Q. Is it correct that you said that you knew him?
MR. BOYLE:
Just a question for clarification. Can we have a citation for his
position as Commander of Division 1?
MR. KOPPE:
Yes, it's that same organagram, E3/1170, that I discussed
earlier, and in Division 1 you can read three names and the third
name is Chhorn.
MR. BOYLE:
And it identifies him as the member?
BY MR. KOPPE:
A member of the Division 1 Committee.
Q. So, Mr. Witness, is it correct that you knew him?
2-TCW-1037:
A. Chhorn, I knew that person clearly, but he was not the
commander of the division. Previously, he was chief of the
regiment and then the military general staff may have assigned
him to the division.
Q. I understand. Was this Chhorn on the same level as Ren from
Division 2?
A. No, he was below Ren.
Q. In terms of ranks, could you describe Chhorn and Ren
respectively?
A. At that time, they did not talk about rank. They simply talked
about the regiment or the division but they did not talk about
the specific rank in the military <like today>.
Q. Maybe it's my mispronunciation again, but you said earlier
that Ren is your commander, the Division 2 Commander. My question
is, can you tell us the respective ranks in the hierarchy or the
positions on the hierarchy of Chhorn and Ren?
A. Talking about the hierarchical ranks in the military, it's
unclear to me and I cannot recall it well about his military
ranks within the regiment and the division. <I am not sure on
this point.>
Q. And my very final question. Did you ever see Chhorn and Ren
together or did you ever see Chhorn or Ren in the company of
Vanh?
A. <In general,> they did not meet Ta Vanh much, but Ta Chhorn
and Ta Ren, they met each other often <in the province or> at the
division's meetings.
MR. KOPPE:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. Now, the Chamber gives the floor to the Co-Prosecution
to put questions to the witness.
And the Chamber will continue the hearing until 4.10 <this
afternoon>.
QUESTIONING BY MR. BOYLE:
Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon, Your Honours. Good
afternoon, Counsel.
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. My name is Andrew Boyle. I'm going
to be asking you some questions on behalf of the Co-Prosecutors
this afternoon and then tomorrow morning as well.
Q. Can you tell the Court if you had any formal education as a
child?
2-TCW-1037:
A. When I was young, I did not spend much time in the education
system. I spent only a brief time in the pagoda school. <Then> I
spent about half-a-year <> studying <in the public school in
grade 9 but I did not finish it> and <after a few months>,
unfortunately, our country faced chaos so I fled into the forest
and lived in the forest until 1975, and only in that year that I
came back to the villages. <Later on I have lived in different
places in Battambang province.>
Q. So, how many total years of education did you have as a child?
A. I spent two years and-a-half.
Q. And when did you stop studying?
A. I stopped studying in 1965.
Q. You told the Court earlier that you joined the Khmer Rouge
movement in 1970. What did you do between 1965 and 1970?
A. From 1965 to 1970, I did rice farming at my home village.
Q. And when did you first become aware of members of the Khmer
Rouge revolutionary movement being in your area?
A. I knew about the Khmer Rouge revolution in the area. I learnt
about it in 1968.
Q. When you first joined the movements, were you acting as a
soldier fighting against the Lon Nol forces?
A. At that time, I joined the revolution of the Khmer Rouge in
1970 and, yes, I engaged in fighting against the Lon Nol
soldiers.
Q. And do I understand from your earlier testimony that around
1973 you stopped being a soldier and joined an economics or
logistics unit. Is that correct?
A. Yes, that's correct. In 1973, I quit the army.
Q. And was it at that point that you joined an economics -- what
was called an economics unit based at Vay Chap mountain?
A. No. When I joined the logistic and economic section, I was not
at Vay Chap, because I already left Vay Chap Mountain years ago.
I was at Vay Chap between 1970 and 1971.
Q. And where were you based when you joined the economics unit?
A. When I joined the logistic and economic section of the
military zone, it was in Sector 2.
Q. And when you first joined the economics unit, what was your
position? Did you have a title within the economics unit?
A. I held a position that was equal to <chief of> the battalion
and I was in charge of transporting food, ammunitions, weapons,
to soldiers fighting at the front line.
Q. Were you ever attached to zone forces at any point prior to
1975?
A. Before 1975, I was under the Northwest Zone force.
Q. I'd like to read you a quote from your DC-Cam Statement to see
if it is accurate with what you just told us. It's E3/10666,
English ERN 01330525 to 26, Khmer 01326319, and you're asked:
Question: "In 1971 and 1972, were you promoted to Sector 2 yet?"
Answer: "I was."
Question: "In what year were you promoted to zone soldier?"
Answer: "It was in 1973, late 1972 and early 1973. I went to live
in the zone with the zone army."
Is that accurate?
A. Let me give my answer. Initially, there was not a division
force yet, it was simply a zone force. And in that zone force,
the structure was divided into the logistic and economics, the
transportation unit. And after I left the army, I joined that
section and that section was still under the supervision of the
zone.
Q. Now, talking about the period after April 17 1975, what
position did you hold at that point?
A. Talking about the period after 1975, I was still working in
the economic section. I was in charge of controlling the food and
the weapons and ammunition warehouse and, later on, I joined the
fishing unit.
Q. Did you hold the title of Deputy Chief of Economics for
Division 2? Were you promoted to that title in 1975?
A. Yes, I was the deputy chief in charge of the military
economics.
Q. And was the chief in charge of military economics, that is,
your superior, was that the Ta Sum that you referenced earlier?
A. No, not Som (phonetic) but Sum.
Q. I apologize for my mispronunciation. You just mentioned that
you were transferred to the fishing unit at some point. Can you
tell us when it was that you were transferred to the fishing
unit?
A. I was transferred to the fishing unit in 1976.
Q. And what was your job as a member of the fishing unit? Did you
still hold the position of Deputy Chief of Economics?
A. Yes, I still maintained that position as the deputy chief.
Q. And can you tell the Court what the fishing unit did?
A. To my recollection, at that time the fishing unit were
responsible for <catching> fish <and making> fermented fish in
order to supply <both the dried and raw fish> to the soldiers in
Division 1 and Division 2 <as well as the office and department>
of the <> zone.
Q. So was that fish that was caught by your unit only for
soldiers? Was it also distributed to members of the communities
in the Northwest Zone?
A. No, the fish were not distributed to the civilians, they were
only distributed to the soldiers of the zone. As for the
civilians, they were supplied fish by the other fishing units
that were supervised at the level of communes and districts.
