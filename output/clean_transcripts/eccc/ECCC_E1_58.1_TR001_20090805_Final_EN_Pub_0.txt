you have already taken an oath.  Is that correct?
A. It is correct, Your Honour.
Q. We now proceed to inform the rights and obligations of a
witness.
As a witness, Mr. Cheam Sour, you may decline to answer any
questions that you are afraid that your testimony could
self-incriminate you.  So you have the right not to incriminate
yourself and at the same time you shall tell the truth, nothing
but the truth.
Mr. Cheam Sour, where did you live and what did you do during the
time between 1970 to 1975, the 17th of April 1975?
A. I joined the Khmer Rouge army and during the time when we
fought against the Lon Nol regime, and in 1975 I moved to Tuek
L'ak village to plant potatoes -- sweet potatoes and cassavas.
And after 1975, the person named Chan came to take me to join the
training, military training at Preaek Hour in Ta Khmau.  After
the training, I went to work at S-21 to guard the compound.  At
the beginning, I did not know that I would be taken to work at
S-21 and that S-21 could have been the prison.
Q. So during the time when the country was at war between 1970 to
1975, you worked as a soldier to liberate the country.  Is that
correct?

Q. In which location did you work at and in which sector?
A. I worked as a militia in the Kampong Chhnang sector.
Q. You said after the 17th of April 1975, you was taken by Chan
to Phnom Penh to work at Teuk L'ak area.  Is that correct?

recollection do you still remember when were you taken to work in
Phnom Penh and who took you?
A. It was Chan, the Chan with ringworms.
Q. Can you tell us about the date when you were being taken from
that location to Phnom Penh?
Mr. Cheam Sour, could you please be reminded that before you can
respond please wait until you see the red light is on the mic,
otherwise your responses would not be well communicated to the
parties to the proceeding and to the Judges, and also we will
find it difficult to have your speech or testimony recorded in
the transcript.
And it is also important that your message is rendered by our
interpreters so that it can be heard, and be reminded that we are
now using three languages at the same time:  Khmer, French and
English.  So, once again, please be reminded that speaking before
the mic is on is just useless.
Do you still remember that when you were taken to work in Phnom
Penh, when was it?
A. I don't remember it.
Q. Were you the only person to be taken to work in Phnom Penh or
did you come along with other people from your place?
A. There were quite a lot of people.
Q. When were you assigned to work at the beginning, in which

Q. Do you remember that when you were taken to work at S-21 --
just tell the date -- when exactly was it?
A. No, I don't remember the date.
Q. Do you know the location you claimed that you had worked at?
You said it was S 21, so to the best of your recollection can you
tell the Court where should it have been located?
A. It is at the Tuol Svay Prey location, which is the Tuol Sleng
Museum currently.
Q. When you were assigned to work at that location, what kind of
assignment was it and in which unit you belonged to?
A. I worked at the S-21 unit under the supervision of S-21, of
course.
Q. What kind of assignment was you given?
A. I was assigned to guard outside.
Q. You worked as a guard, guarding outside S-21.  Who was the
chief of the team or unit or the platoon or company; so can you
remember any of them?
A. I don't remember their names.
Q. Do you remember the chief of the unit, or the platoon, or the
company because you worked in such a military unit, there could
have been the chiefs or the commanders, for example?  So we are
not asking you to remember staff members or your colleagues, but
we would like you to tell the Court if you remember the chiefs of
the platoon or the company under which you worked.
A. The chief of the company was Peng, who was supervising the
company back then.
Q. As a guard who had to guard outside, can you tell the Court

daily basis?

MR. PRESIDENT:
Judges of the Bench, would you wish to put questions to this
witness?
The Counsel, you take the floor.
MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to make a small
observation in relation to the record of the interview of the
witness before the Co-Investigating Judges with ERN 00162758,
document D22/12.  On the second page, I would like to quote the
portion.
In the first point, there has been contradictory messages because
the witness said that he could read and write Khmer, but then in
the next line he indicated that he did not go to school because
he was very poor.
So we would like the parties to the proceedings who are going to
put questions to the witness to simplify their questions to make
sure that you can assist him with clear messages because he is
illiterate and that he is a peasant or palm juice collector, so
his educational background is very limited.
So please make sure that questions are brief and precise so that
the witness is able to respond efficiently and accurately.  Thank
you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Ya Sokhan, you may proceed with your questions.
JUDGE YA SOKHAN:

know who were the superiors at S-21?

like to know who would be the most responsible person at that
location?

another group would come in.
Q. Did you know the groups that came in later?  What group was
it?
A. They were from the various guarding locations.  I was not sure
whether they were from the north side or not.
Q. Did you ever meet those guards, the inside guards?

lunch and left?
A. I didn't know that.
Q. When you stood guard outside what gun was given to you?  Were
all of you armed?
A. No, not all of us armed.  There were only two guns within our
group, so we took turns to hold the gun.
Q. During the time that you stood guarding did you ever see any
vehicle passing by and going inside the compound?

Q. What was the condition of those vehicles?  Were they
fully-covered vehicles or could you see the back of the vehicles?
Did you see any people there?
A. I only heard the sounds of the vehicles but I did not go

where I stood guard.
Q. During the time that you stood guard, could you estimate how
many vehicles entering S-21 and what was the frequency of those

Q. Did you only hear the sound of the vehicles or did you see the
vehicles with your own eyes?
A. I only heard the sound of the vehicles.

other people walk the prisoners?
A. No, I did not.
Q. Did you ever see any foreign prisoners; for example, white

A. No, I did not see any of them.  When I stood guard outside, I
saw one foreign prisoner being walked.  I did not know the
nationality of that person.
Q. You saw one prisoner being walked, when was that?
A. I did not know when it was.
Q. I just want to know whether the person was being walked in the
morning, at lunch, at noon time, or in the evening?  Can you tell
us?
A. It was around six p.m.
Q. How far were you when you saw that prisoner being walked?
A. I could not estimate; the distance was pretty far.
Q. How many blocks were you away?
A. At that time, there were no houses next to each other.  There
was only sporadic houses here and there.
Q. How many prisoners who were being walked when you saw them?
A. Three prisoners were being walked.
Q. How many prisoners?
A. There was only one prisoner.
Q. What happened to that prisoner?
A. I did not actually see the prisoner being walked in detail.  I
only had a glimpse while he was -- while that person was being
walked.
Q. Was the prisoner handcuffed and blindfolded?
A. I did not notice that.
Q. Which direction to the prisoner was being walked?
A. I did not know from which direction the prisoner was being
walked.  I only saw him being walked while I stood guard.
Q. Was it to the north or south side of the location where you
stood guard?
A. The prisoner was being walked toward the south direction from
the location where I stood guard.
Q.  At that time, were you standing on guard or did you patrol?
A. I was patrolling up and down.
Q. What happened next to that prisoner?
A. I did not know.
Q. The three people who walked that prisoner, did you see them
carry any car tyres?
A. Only after I returned I saw them placing the car tyres onto
the body of that prisoner.
Q. You just stated that the prisoner was being walked and the
question is, did the people who walked that prisoner carry any
car tyres?
A. They did not carry any car tyres when they walked that
prisoner.
Q. Did you see the prisoner being asked to sit?
A. Yes, he was asked to sit.
Q. What happened next, after he was asked to sit?
A. They put the car tyres onto his body through his head.
Q. So, at that time, the prisoner was still alive while he was
ordered to sit.  Is this correct?
A. Yes, the prisoner was alive.
Q. How many car tyres did they insert onto his body, through his
head.  Is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. How many car tyres?
A. I was not sure how many of the car tyres were inserted onto
the body of that prisoner.
Q. When the car tires were being inserted onto the body of that
prisoner, were the three people who walked him present at the
same time -- at that time?
A. Later they all left.  And they burned that person.
Q. Did they carry any gun?
A. They did not carry any gun.
Q. Among the three people, who actually lit the car tyres?
A. All the three of them.
Q. What else did you observe after the car tyres were being lit
and they were burning?  What happened to that prisoner?
A. I did not look.  I only saw the car tyres were burning.
Q. How long did it take for the car tyres to completely burn?
A. I was not sure because then the shift ended.
Q. How many hours did it take for those car tyres to burn off?
A. I did not know how many hours.  I did not have a watch to look
at at the time.
Q. What was your guarding hours at that time?
A. From 6 to 12.
Q. You mean 6 p.m. to 12 a.m.?  And when you saw the prisoner was
being walked, it was almost dusk.  So during the six hours of
your shift, did you observe the incident through the whole shift?
A. At that time the car tyres were still burning, but then the
shift ended.
Q. When your shift ended, what else did you see?  Did you see the
prisoner was burned -- half of the body was burned off or what?
A. During the time that I stood guard, the body -- the car tyres
were still burning.  I think probably everything was burned off
during the next shift.
Q. What was your next shift on the next day?
A. I started again from 6 p.m.
Q. Did you look at the direction where the prisoner was burned;
any remnants or the leftover of the body of the prisoner?
A. Yes, I did saw some remaining there.
Q. What remainings were left?
A. I saw the black torso and also the black burnt legs.
Q. So they did not use more car tyres to burn the body
completely?
A. No, they did not use any other tyres.
Q. You said there were remainings, that was the black torso and
the burnt legs, and you said the body was burnt away.  Was the
body completely burnt to ashes or the remains were still there?
A. At that time, they burnt off the body but the body was not
completely burnt because they did not use extra car tyres to burn
the body completely off.  There were some remainings of the body.
Q. So next day, during your shift, you still saw the remainings
of the body of that prisoner.  Is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. So then you continued for six hours during your guard shift.
Was the remains of the body removed or was it still there when
your shift ended?
A. The remains of the body were still there.  Nobody touched it.
Q. Until your shift ended at 12 a.m., the remains of the body
were still there.  Is this correct?
A. At the location where I guarded, the remains of the body were
still there.  Nobody took it away.
Q. Until when did you not see the remains; how many days after
that?
A. I did not know.  Later on, it disappeared.
Q. Can you estimate how many more days or how many shifts of the
guard duty did you do before the body was removed?
A. I did not look into that location later on when I was on duty.
Q. You saw that incident.  Did any of your work colleagues see
that incident as well?
A. In my group, we talked to each other that a body was being
burned away.
Q. Did you clearly see the three people who took that prisoner to
be burned away?  Did you know which group they belonged to, or
did you know any of the three people?
A. I did not know them and I did not know which group they
belonged to.
Q. Did you know that S-21 staff were arrested and detained at
S-21?
A. I did not know that.
Q. You just said then that Hong, your group chief who already
died, was he arrested or what?
A. He was arrested.  He was arrested and detained at S-21.
Q. Hong, your group chief, did he also stay at that house where
you stayed?
A. Yes.  We stayed together.
Q. When your group chief was arrested, when was that and how was
the arrest conducted?  Did they use blankets to cover his body?
A. No, there was no blanket.  He was arrested on the pretext that
he was asked to attend a meeting to get the assignment for his
duty.
Q. Did you know the reason for the arrest of Hong?  What mistakes
did he make?
A. I did not know.
Q. Was it not because he nod off while he was on that duty?
A. No, I did not know what mistake he made.
Q. So he was asked to attend a meeting and when was that?
A. I did not really know the details.  I think it was in the
evening.  I just cannot tell you the exact time.
Q. Can you recall who came to call Hong to go to attend the
meeting?  Was the person also a member of your group or was the
person coming from another group?
A. The person came from another group from the inside of the
compound.
Q. How many people actually came?
A. There were three of them.
Q. What exactly did they tell Hong?  For example, under whose
instructions that he was required to go and attend a meeting?
What did you hear?
A. I forget.  I cannot recall what was said to him at the time.
Q. When the three of them came to tell Hong did Hong immediately
go with them or he went in the next morning?
A. He left immediately.
Q. Did they walk him off or was he transported?
A. All of them walked.
Q. Did you see him return?
A. No, I didn't.  I thought that he would have died.
Q. Who told you about this, that he died?
A. Hong's brother told me.
Q. What was the name of Hong's brother?
Could you please reminded to wait until you see the red light
before you respond?  Can you tell us again what was the name of
Hong's brother?
A. He was Khieu Peou.
Q. Was he an inside guard?
A. Yes, he was.  He worked with his brother.
Q. Did you ever ask Hong's brother whether he could be taken to
be interrogated?
A. No, I didn't.
Q. Did you know where Hong was detained?
A. No, I didn't.
Q. Did you know where Hong would be taken to, because he
disappeared?
A. No, I have no idea.
Q. Did you ever see any female detainee being walked by guards,
from inside out or from outside in, to S-21?
A. No, I have never seen that.
Q. Had you ever been told that inside the compound there were
some individual cells and that detainees would be given meals or
not or whether they had a wash?  You know that?
A. No, I don't.
Q. You worked outside.  How long had you been assigned to guard
outside before you were reassigned?
A. I don't remember.  It was almost the time when Yuon or the
Vietnamese approached, then I was sent to the rice fields.
Q. So you had worked as the outside guard until the day you were
sent to the rice field.  Is that correct?
A. Yes, it is.
Q. During the time when you worked at that location had you ever
been sent to attend any trainings, political sessions for example
or any other trainings in which instructions on how to guard
would be lectured?
A. Actually, we did not attend such any formal meetings or
sessions.  We were told from one another how to be a good guard.
Q. Did you attend political sessions?
A. No, I didn't because I did not write or read so there was no
point I was invited to attend such sessions.
Q. Among the 12 people in your group was there anyone ever called
to attend such political sessions?
A. I never saw anyone going to attend such political sessions.
None of the colleagues in my group ever attended such sessions.
I don't know what happened to the other groups.
Q. Had you ever paid a visit into the inner part of the S-21
compound?
A. No, I hadn't.
Q. Did you know back then that the Vietnamese prisoners of war
were being detained inside the S-21?
A. No, I have no idea and I didn't know about that.
Q. Do you know that detainees were taken to be interrogated and
that tortures were used?  Had you ever heard any conversations
among your colleagues about these issues?
A. No, I had never heard anyone of us who share such
conversation.   ...
Q. When exactly were you sent to the rice field?
A. I don't remember the date.
Q. Can you give us an approximate figure, for example, how many
months before the 7th of January 1979.
A. No, I don't.  At that time we did not know the date.  We were
focusing only on our work, that's all.
Q. Did you also learn that detainees would be taken to be
executed at Choeung Ek?
A. No.
JUDGE YA SOKHAN:
Mr. President, I have no further questions to put to this
witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judges of the Bench, would you wish to put further questions?
Judge Lavergne, you take the floor.
BY JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Q. Could you remind us how old you were when you arrived in S-21?
A. I don't remember, Your Honour.
Q. How long did you work as a guard in S-21?
A. I forget already.
Q. Where were you on the 7th of January 1979 when the Vietnamese
arrived or entered Phnom Penh?
A. I ran home to my home town.
Q. Before you ran away, where were you?  Were you in S-21 or were
you somewhere else?
A. I was at rice fields.
Q. For how long had you been at the rice fields?
A. I don't remember.
Q. And what rice field was this one?
A. It was at Prey Sar.
Q. Where you there to be re-educated or were you there just to
cultivate the soil?  Who sent you there?
A. I was there to temper myself and to cultivate rice, but I
don't remember who sent me there.
Q. Had you done anything wrong in particular that justified your
being sent to Prey Sar?
A. The whole group was removed and sent to work at the rice
fields.
Q. Were you interviewed by the Co-Investigating Judges?  I
believe you were, and I think this was the document number D22/12
of the case file which we have mentioned before.  And in your
interview, you mention the fear that you felt on several
occasions as well as the discipline under which the guards
worked.  I would like you to tell us a little bit more about the
fear you felt.  What were you afraid of exactly when you were in
S-21?
A. I would not like to respond to this question, please.
Q. Can you tell us whether you are still afraid today; when you
think of S-21 are you still frightened?
A. No, I'm not feeling any frightened.
Q. And today, are you afraid of the accused?
A. No, I'm not.
Q. Are you afraid of the judges?
A. Yes, I am a little bit afraid of the judges.
Q. I believe you have had the opportunity to meet with your
lawyer, who explained a number of things to you, including the
fact that you may not answer questions that might incriminate
you.  But, I would say that apart from that you must answer and
contribute to the ascertainment of the truth.  So what can you
tell us about the discipline and the instructions that you
followed?
Was it easy to be a guard in S-21 or was it difficult?
A. It was difficult because we were frightened and we had to work
hard to guard the compound.
Q. Did you have any contact with the outside world, or were you
completely shut in and only spent time amongst yourselves?  Did
you have any contact with your family and friends?  Did you have
any opportunity to go to Phnom Penh?
A. Could you please repeat your question, Your Honour?
Q. Did you have any contact with your family during the time when
you were in S-21?
A. No, I didn't.
Q. What can you tell us about Duch?  Did you participate in
training sessions with him?
A. No, I did not participate in any training sessions with him.
There were other people who participated in such sessions with
him.
Q. And did you know what Duch said during these training
sessions?
A. No, I didn't know what Duch instructed the trainees because I
never attended such session.
Q. During your interview by the Co-Investigating Judges, that is
the Co-Investigating Judges' investigators, you said this,
amongst other things -- I'm referring to  of the French,
that is document number D22/12.  ERN is 002162753.  The following
question is put to you:
"Q. Were you afraid?"
And you answer:
"A. I was afraid all the time.  I tried to avoid falling asleep
during guard duty.  If we fell asleep we were sure to die.
Q. You say that you did not see people being killed, so why were
you afraid?
A. I was afraid because I did not know whether I was making
mistakes.  I was afraid of being arrested like the others.
Q. Did you receive warnings or threats?
A. It was said that Duch had set up a plan so that if an enemy
were to escape you would be arrested and imprisoned within a
minute."
Do you recall saying that?
A. Yes, I do, although I feel like I'm not sure whether I have
remembered this portion.
Q. How many times did you come across or run into Duch?  Did you
know what he did at S-21?
A. At S-21 he was the big boss, supervising or administering all
the units at S-21.
Q. You also said that everyone was very frightened of Duch.  Is
that true?
A. Yes, it is.
Q. So today can you tell us why you are no longer frightened of
Duch and you are more frightened of the judges instead?
A. I would like to also apologize that I said this because I was
afraid I would make any wrong statement in the Court.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
I have no further questions for this witness, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Next we would like to give the floor to the Co-Prosecutors to put
questions to the witness.  You take the floor.
MR. YET CHAKRIYA:
Thank you, Mr. President.
QUESTIONING BY THE CO-PROSECUTORS
BY MR. YET CHAKRIYA:
Q. Mr. Cheam Sour, you stated that before 1975 you joined the
chhlop, or militia.  How old were you back then?
A. I was 12 years old.
Q. What was your task at that time, being the chhlop?
A. I was asked or assigned to ambush the Lon Nol soldiers.
Q. Were you armed?
A. Yes, I was.
Q. What kind of weapon were you equipped with?
A. It was a kind of weapon in Khmer we call pram bei nat.
Q. Did you ever run into the soldiers of Lon Nol or fought with
them?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. So you claimed that you were 12 years old and you were
equipped with arms to fight the Lon Nol soldiers.  Is that
correct?  And you said that after 1975 you were trained on
military techniques.  At that time did you receive any
instruction as what kind of -- why you were trained such military
techniques?
A. Could you please repeat your question, Mr. Prosecutor?
Q. After the fall of Phnom Penh you were trained on military
techniques.  Were you told of any purposes of such trainings?
A. I was told that we had to fight the Vietnamese, or Yuon.
Q. Had you ever fought the Yuon, the Vietnamese?
A. No, I had not.
Q. When you had meals together in a group did you ever see
children?
A. No, I didn't see any children.
Q. At S-21 did you participate in the self-criticism meetings in
each group?
A. Yes, I did.  We attended self-criticism meetings in order to
criticize ourselves and to build up ourselves to protect the
compound, not to let detainees escape.
Q. How often was the meeting of self-criticism convened?
A. Sometimes once a week, sometimes once after three days.
Q. Who led such meetings?
A. The chief of the unit was in charge but I don't remember the
name of that person.
Q. When you were on guard at S-21 did you ever hear any cries or
screamings from the detainees?
A. I heard some kind of screamings but probably not from the
cries of the people.  I heard some kind of cries, but I believe
that it could have been the cries or the screamings of the people
but I was a little bit far from the compound.
Q. What kind of screams do you believe would it be?
A. I think that would have been the screams of the people who
suffered some kind of pains or tortures.
MR. YET CHAKRIYA:
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  I would like to
share the floor with my co-colleague.
MR. AHMED:
Mr. President, I have a very few number of questions for this
witness.
BY MR. AHMED:
Q. Were you ever disciplined for any mistake that you committed
during the time that you were at S-21?
A. No, I was not.  Sorry, could you please repeat your question?
The discipline here refers to the discipline among our guards or
discipline in relation to the detainees?
Q. Your chief, Hong, was arrested for a mistake that was
committed.  Were you told that you had committed a mistake and
that you should not committed any further or were you ever
punished for any mistake that you committed yourself?
A. I was instructed -- so I was instructed to reconstruct myself
and ourselves.
Q. What was the mistake you had committed for which you were
instructed?
A. Actually, I did not make much mistake.  Actually, we were
instructed that if we made a small mistake not to repeat it.
Q. Just as you saw one foreigner being burned to death, did you
see any other bodies being buried around the boundary where you
were guarding?
A. No, I did not see that.
Q. This kind of question has been asked to you before, but did
you ever see the accused during the time you were at S-21 during
those two and a half years that you were a guard?
A. Could you please repeat your question?  I did not hear it
properly.
Q. Did you see the accused during the time you were a guard at
S-21?
A. No, I never saw him.  I only stayed at my place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The counsel for the witness you may proceed.
MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Thank you, Mr. President.
I would like the Co-Prosecutor to make it clear when you talk
about "the accused" I think the witness is confused.  "The
accused" here probably he refers to the prisoners who were
detained during that time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Co-Prosecutor, you may continue.
BY MR. AHMED:
Q. Did you see Duch during the time you were a guard at S-21?
A. Yes, I saw him.  I saw him and I knew him.
Q. Where did you see him in S-21?
A. I saw him at the location where I worked.  I did not go
inside.  I only saw him outside only at the location where I
worked.
Q. What was Duch doing when you saw him at the location where you
worked?
A. When I saw him, he was coming out to look at the rice, at the
kitchen.
Q. Was he instructing people to do something or not to do
something?
A. I did not know whether he gave instructions to other people.
I did not bear to stay there long.
MR. AHMED:
Mr. President, with your permission, can I request the projection
of a picture, P00005247, and then I'll ask my question?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The AV official, can you project the photo with the said ERN
number as requested by the Co-Prosecutor?
BY MR. AHMED:
Q. Mr. Cheam Sour, can you see this picture and can you remember
if the dining hall where you had your meals was similar to this?
A. No, I did not recognize this.
Q. Can you see the picture of the person standing on the extreme
left-hand side and can you remember that person?
A. It is not really very clear to me, so I cannot identify the
person.
MR. AHMED:
Can the AV Unit please focus it on the person standing on the
left-hand side corner of this picture?
Your Honour, it may be connected to the OCP computer which has it
projected very properly?
BY MR. AHMED:
Q. Mr. Cheam Sour, can you now identify the person on the extreme
left-hand side of this picture?
A. I could not recognize the person who look down, but the other
person, that's the photo of Duch.
Q. And when you saw Duch, was he in the dining hall when he was
instructing people about the rice?
A. I do not really know the location in this photo.  It could be
the location inside his workplace?
MR. AHMED:
Your Honours, just last two questions on a different matter.
BY MR. AHMED:
Q. Mr. Cheam Sour, when you were guarding were you guarding an
entrance to the S-21 or was it a boundary?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The AV officer, you can remove the photo and only show the normal
courtroom.
Mr. Witness, you can now respond to the Co-Prosecutor's question.
BY MR. AHMED:
Q. My question, Mr. Cheam Sour, was when you were guarding S-21,
was it an entrance to S-21 or you were just guarding a boundary,
a wall?
A. I stood guard the outside of the compound.  Actually, I was
guarding the outer perimeter of S-21.
Q. Was it a zinc wall?
A. I was guarding outside the zinc fence.
MR. AHMED:
Your Honours, I have no further questions for this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now it is time for a break.  The Chamber will take 20 minutes
break and we will resume at 11 a.m.
Court officer, can you provide necessary refreshment to the
witness and bring him back at said time?
THE GREFFIER:
All rise.
(Judges exit courtroom)
(Court recesses from 1039H to 1101H)
(Judges enter courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated.  The Court is now in session.
We would like now to give the floor to the civil party lawyers to
put questions to the witness.
Civil party lawyers have got 40 minutes to put questions to the
witness.  The floor is yours.
MS. TRUSSES-NAPROUS:
Thank you, Mr. President, to give us the floor, and I will speak
first; first of all on behalf of group 3 and, afterwards, I will
speak on behalf of the civil party lawyer of group number 4 will
take the floor to continue putting questions to the witness.
QUESTIONING BY CIVIL PARTY COUNSEL
BY MS. TRUSSES-NAPROUS:
Q. So I would like as a first question to put to the witness --
first of all, I would like to greet you, Mr. Cheam Sour, and I
thank you for your presence here, and I know that this is
probably a very difficult moment for you.
You stated to the investigators that when you joined the Pol Pot
army in 1973, you were forced by your teacher, apparently.  So
can you please give us the details about how you joined Pol Pot's
army?  Was this -- did you do so wilfully or were you forced to
join Pol Pot's army?
A. I was forced to join the army.
Q. Can you please give us details on the way that this happened?
A. Could you please repeat the question?
Q. Can you please provide us with a few details regarding how
this happened?  How did your school teacher bring you to join
this army?  Did you leave for the army without seeing your
parents again?  Could you please give us a few details about all
of this?
A. I was forced to join the Pol Pot army.  I really missed my
parents, but I did not dare escape or run home to see them
because I had to work.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Cheam Sour.
So, later on, you underwent training, training for shooting and
for removing mines, and you were told that this training was
preparing you to fight against the Vietnamese.  This is, again,
what you said to the investigators.
And can you please tell me which details they gave you about the
conflict with the Vietnamese; what were you told about the
Vietnamese?
A. During the training in which I learned how to remove mines and
to shoot guns, we were instructed to be able to know how to fight
the Vietnamese.  But after the training we were not sent to fight
the Vietnamese, but instead we were taken to work at S-21.
Q. Do you know if some of the people in your group went away to
fight the Vietnamese?
A. Some of our people were segregated and they fought the
Vietnamese while the other would be taken to work at S-21, like
in my unit.
Q. There again, who was the enemy then?
A. We were asked to guard the Vietnamese enemies but I never saw
any Vietnamese enemies.  They were all Cambodians.
Q. Thank you very much.  This is indeed what you said to the
investigators, and earlier on today you spoke about the
conditions in which your work was taking place.  You had to do
rounds but you also were planting cassava, which was used to feed
you.  Was it only food for the guards or was this also food that
you were planting for the prisoners as well?  Do you know
anything about this?
A. When we planted vegetables they were meant to feed the unit.
Q. Thank you very much.  Can you tell me if there was any kind of
communication between the guards from the outer perimeter and
with those of the inner perimeter?  Can you please give us
details about this?
A. People outside could not make any contact with the people
inside.
Q. You said that you had seen trucks and that you knew that
trucks were coming in to S-21.  Did you ever wonder what was
happening to the people inside these trucks?  For you were they
just transporting prisoners or were they transporting other
things?
A. I saw the trucks but I don't know whether the trucks were
transporting vegetables or people, but I believe that since the
trucks were sealed or covered with curtains I believe there were
people inside.
Q. So you believed that there were people inside because then you
knew that you were guarding a prison.  Is that so?
A. Yes, it is, because when I worked as a guard outside I was
asked not to let any detainees escape from the compound.
Q. Thank you very much.  You said earlier on today that you did
not partake in any meetings with Duch, and here I have before me
what you said to the investigators:  Index D22/12, ERN 00162749
in French, and I would please like to remind you of what you
said. The following question was put to you:
"Q. When you were guarding the outside of the prison did somebody
come to teach you politics?"
And then you answered:
"A. There was only Duch and Hor who would summon the guards for
meetings and they were teaching us politics and they were giving
us instructions regarding the enemy so that they wouldn't
escape."
And the investigator put the following question to you:
"Q. Did you see Duch in person?"
And you answered:
"A. Yes, in each meeting.
Q. What did Duch say?
A. Well, he was speaking about the enemy.  He said while on guard
you should not fall asleep.  You have to make efforts to build
yourself.  If you are not able to do so you would be sent to
jail.
Q. Was anything else taught?
A. No."
So can you confirm this statement?
A. I did not partake in that political sessions with Duch or Hor
but Peng did instruct on us the political affairs which is
related to the rule that each detainee had to be contained in the
building and that if anyone could escape then we would be in
place of those who escaped.
Q. Thank you.  Now I would like to get to the facts that you
witnessed regarding the foreigner whom you saw being burnt alive.
So I apologize for having to get back to this point which most
certainly must be extremely painful for you, but it is suited to
provide a few clarifications here.
You said to the Co-Investigating Judges that this event took
place at around 11 o'clock in the morning and you said, however,
today that it happened at 6 o'clock in the afternoon.  So in
order to try to have you remember exactly when these events
occurred, could we consider recalling the moments when you were
really on patrol, because I didn't quite understand earlier on
today -- I understood, of course, that there was a difference
between when you were guarding and you couldn't move and when you
were patrolling.
And then you said that you were patrolling, however, when this
event occurred.  So can you tell us exactly what was the exact
patrolling schedule, from what time to what time?
A. As I already said earlier on, I did not know the exact time
because I did not have a watch to wear and I only checked with
the sky to see what time it was, and the guards had to move
around and they were not supposed to sit only in one fixed
position.
Q. So how many metres did you cover while you were on patrol?
What was the length of your round?
A. I had to patrol in a significant large area because I could
see that the place where I stood to the place that I walked to
was about 20 metres.
Q. You said earlier on today that you would use the sun as a
landmark to know where you were.  So where was the sun at the
moment when this burning event occurred?
A. I'm not quite sure I can answer to this but, at that time, I
could not remember the road but I know for sure that the road
links to Tuol Tumpoung market.  It was the road I was working on.
Q. You said that for you the prisoner who had tyres put on him
was burnt alive.  So what makes you say that he was burnt alive?
A. I saw him being walked first before he was put to sit down,
and then car tyres would be put on him and then he was burned.
And then I walked back.
Q. Did you hear any screams?
A. No, I didn't.
Q. I would like to know now, what did you feel after seeing this
happen?
A. I did not feel anything, but I believed at that time I was
rather sympathetic for the person who was being burned alive.
Maybe he had committed something wrong or maybe he did not.
Q. Now, what do you feel when you think about this event?
A. I can feel that the person committed any wrongdoing would be
burned alive, and I would also see that one day if I committed
any wrongdoing I would experience the same fate.
MS. TRUSSES-NAPROUS:
Thank you very much, Mr. Cheam Sour.  I have no further
questions.  So I will let the civil party lawyer of group 4 take
the floor.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Civil party lawyer group 4, you take the floor.
MR. KONG PISEY:
Thank you, Mr. President.
I'm Kong Pisey and I have a couple of questions to be put to the
witness.
Good morning, Your Honours and good morning, Mr. Cheam Sour.
BY MR. KONG PISEY:
Q. I only have three questions which I need to seek clarification
from you.  The questions have already been put to you by the
Judges, but I just need clarification.
You said that Chan brought you from your place.  Do you remember
whether Chan has any alias other than Chan?
A. No, I don't.  I only learned that he was called Chan.
Q. Do you know whether that person earned any rank or status in
S-21?
A. I believe that Chan and Peng were lower than Duch.
Q. You said that the chief of your unit was Hong who was arrested
and detained at S-21.  You said Khieu Peou who was the brother of
Hong, and that he told you that Hong was arrested.  So could you
tell the Court how he told you about that event?
A. I don't think I understand your question.  Could you please
repeat?
Q. You said Hong was your chief of the unit, and that Hong was
arrested and detained at S-21 inside the compound.  Hong had a
brother named Khieu Peou, and Khieu Peou saw his brother being
detained there, and Peou told you about this -- Hong told you
about this.  So could you please tell the Court how could you
learn of this information?
A. Hong, who was in charge of my unit before he was arrested, he
instructed us to be ourselves and not to be like him, and we had
to be vigilant and firm.  And after I shared my conversation with
Khieu Peou, then Khieu Peou told me that Hong, who was his
brother, was not taken to be re-educated but to be detained in
the prison.  He was jailed.
Q. Thank you.  The next question.
Do you know what happened to Khieu Peou, the brother of Hong?
Was he arrested?
A. No, he wasn't because I don't know -- because I think Peou did
not tell anyone that Hong was his brother, otherwise, he would
have been jailed because the Khmer Rouge slogan reads that to dig
grass you have to root it out.  Something like that.  So I think
in that time if anyone implicated then the rest would be
arrested.
Q. Thank you.   My apologies.  So later on when you had meals at
your place did you ever see Khieu Peou?
A. No, I never saw him again.  It was the last time when I saw
him when he told me that his brother was jailed.
Q. Thank you.  The next question is about the tempering at Prey
Sar.  You said you went there in a group.  So do you know what
mistake had the group committed before they were sent there?
A. I don't know.  Angkar was the one who sent us there.  We were
told that the whole group would be removed to work at the rice
fields and no charges were ever told to us.
Q. When you worked at Prey Sar -- and the reason why you were
removed, were you told of the charges?
A. At Prey Sar I was told that I had nothing to do but to build
dikes and grow rice.
Q. When you worked at the rice fields were you guarded by anybody
else?
A. Could you please repeat your question?
Q. When you went to work in the rice field were there any guards
supervising your group?
A. Yes, only us.  We guarded our team and nobody else guarded us.
Q. You said you guarded your group.  Do you mean that you
yourself and the members of the group took turns to guard the
group?
A. Yes, we guarded ourselves at the place where we slept.  We
also guarded the tools that we use, also the kitchen utensils.
Q. When you stay at night where did you stay?
A. We stay in a shelter, which was made from tree leaves and
branches, near the rice fields.
Q. So in the room where you slept were you locked from the
outside and were you guarded?
A. Could you please repeat your question?
Q. At the house or the shelter where you stay at night were you
locked from the outside and were there any guards?
A. There was no lock.  Actually the house or the shelter there
was no wall.  We slept on the hammock under that shelter.
MR. KONG PISEY:
Mr. President, I do not have anymore questions for this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Next I would like to give the floor to the defence counsel to put
questions to this witness.
MR. KAR SAVUTH:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning ladies and
gentlemen.
QUESTIONING BY DEFENCE COUNSEL
BY MR. KAR SAVUTH:
Q. Mr. Sour, at S-21 where you worked did you ever know any
senior leadership who had the rights to issue orders to Duch or
to S-21?
A. Regarding the top level above Duch, I didn't know.  I did not
know from whom he received his orders.
Q. Thank you.  Regarding the time that you worked at S-21 did you
ever see or hear that Duch tortured or killed any prisoner?
A. Only after they received permission from Duch, then the
prisoners were killed.
Q. Thank you.  I would like to state that you worked as a guard
there.  Did you ever see or hear people say Duch tortured or
killed any prisoner?
A. The law is in the hand of Duch and he issued orders to his
subordinates.  I did not know from whom he received his orders.
He issued orders to his subordinates to torture or kill the
prisoners but I myself never saw him torture or kill any
prisoner.  Whenever he issued his order, day or night, it had to
be implemented.
Q. Thank you for saying that you never saw Duch kill any prisoner
with your own eyes.
Also at S-21 you were assigned to stand guard to prevent
prisoners from fleeing.  Were you satisfied with your work?
A. I was satisfied with my work to stand guard because I had to
fulfill my work to reconstruct myself in order to survive.  If I
did not reconstruct myself, then I would not be survived.
Q. Thank you.  So you were happy with your work as you were
assigned from the upper echelon.
MR. KAR SAVUTH:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like my co-counsel to ask
questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
François Roux, you may proceed.
MR. ROUX:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROUX:
Q. Good morning, witness.  I am the second lawyer for the
accused, Duch, and I shall put a number of questions to you, not
very many.
Did you know Him Huy?
A. I did not know Huy.  Huy worked inside the compound.  He was
with the transportation unit.  He transported those prisoners to
be killed.  I only met him during this regime.
Q. You say that you met him afterwards.  Where was this?
A. I met him during the interview at Tuol Sleng.
Q. What visit are you referring to, witness?
A. I met and knew Huy only later on when we were called for the
interview but during that period I did not meet him or know him.
Only later on that during that interview then I learnt that he
was the person transporting the prisoners to be killed at Wat Ek.
Q. Thank you for the clarification.  I would like to return to
your work in S-21 when you were on patrol.
A. (Microphone not activated)
Q. You wanted to say something but you have to have your
microphone on.  Please go on.
A. I do not wish to talk any more.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The counsel for the witness, you may proceed.
MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Mr. President, I would like to consult with my client.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.
The counsel for the witness, you may proceed.
MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The witness cannot actually follow the
interpretation because of his feeling.  Please speak slowly and
the question shall be short so that he can understand and can
respond accordingly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please compose yourself, listen clearly to the
question and if you are not sure you can ask for clarification as
you did this morning.  So the best thing for you is to request
the speaker to put the question to you again.  What you know you
say what you know, and if you don't know you just respond
accordingly.  This morning you have performed very well and I
hope you can continue until the end of your testimony.
The defence counsel, you may proceed and please understand the
limited knowledge of this witness.  Try to make your questions
easy to understand so that he can respond appropriately.
François Roux, you may continue.
MR. ROUX:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROUX:
Q. Witness, we are going to continue with short questions.  When
you were on patrol in S-21 were you alone, were you in pairs or
in threes?  Do you understand my question?  When you were on
patrol were you alone, were you with another guard near you?
A. Usually on patrol we worked in pair or sometimes three persons
according to the shift.
Q. Thank you.  When you saw the event during which the foreigner
was burnt to death were you alone or were there other guards with
you?
THE INTERPRETER:
The interpreter cannot listen to what the witness said.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The defence counsel, please ask your question again because he
does not understand it.
BY MR. ROUX:
Q. Witness, when you saw the event that you described to us, the
event involving the foreigner, were you alone on patrol or did
you have one or two guards with you?
A. At that time I was patrolling with other guards.
Q. Do you remember what the other guard was called?
A. It has been so long already I cannot recall the name.
Q. You said that you were not wearing watch but I would like you
to recall for us what your shift hours were, because I did not
understand a while ago -- it may have been a translation problem.
So the question is what time was your shift on that day; that is,
from what time to what time?
A. My shift started from 6 p.m. until 12 a.m.
Q. That is very precise.  Thank you very much.
You said that you did not see the end of the scene you witnessed
because this was when you ended your shift.  Is that correct?
A. That is correct because my shift ended.
Q. So I might take it that this event occurred at night.  Is that
correct?
A. The burning started around 6 p.m. and, like I said, when I
ended my shift the burning was still continuing.
Q. All right.  So you witnessed this scene at the beginning of
your shift.  Is that correct?
A. That is correct.  I saw the prisoner being walked and later on
he was burned.  That was at the beginning of my shift.
Q. Thank you.
You said a while ago that it was around the road leading to Tuol
Tompong.  Is that correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Is that what is referred to as the national road?
A. At that time I did not know what it was referred to.  It was
the road leading to Tuol Tompong.
Q. And you said a while ago to the civil party lawyer that you
were some 20 metres away from where the event was taking place.
Is that correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. You also told the civil party lawyer that you did not hear any
shouting.  Is that correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. ROUX:
I have no further questions, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber would like now to give the opportunity to the accused
to make his observations regarding the testimony of this witness
if the accused wishes to do so.
THE ACCUSED:
Mr. President, I have been waiting for this witness in order to
respond to the complaint by A Mil, the civil party, because I am
still not clear on certain things.
My order was for the subordinates to burn dead bodies but later
on it was heard that the prisoner was burned alive.  And during
the questioning in the Chamber, especially in the testimony of
Comrade Huy, it seems to be clearer than the rest because he and
his group was responsible for smashing but he did not describe in
details.  Probably he was afraid of self-incriminate.
And regarding whether the prisoner was burned alive or not,
Comrade Khan Said Soeu told him that if we want to make certain
then we should go and ask Soeu -- that was what was said by Prak
Khan.  But Soeu during his testimony to this Chamber he said
either Prak Khan or Mam Nai alias Chan were known to him only
during the filming later on.  And in responding to the question
put by Mr. François Roux, he said he only knew Prak Khan later
on.
So what he said regarding the burning alive of a prisoner seems
to carry no weight.  It is hard to believe what he said.  So his
testimony -- it is hard for me to believe that a prisoner was
burned alive.  I still believe the testimony of Comrade Huy
because I still believe nobody dared to violate my order because
it was absolute.  They had to be killed and then they had to be
burned to ashes, not to leave any remaining on that street.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The accused, you are reminded for your observations please
address it to the Chamber and not address it to the witness.
THE ACCUSED:
I am speaking to the Chamber, Your Honour, although I looked into
the other direction.
In conclusion, I still do not believe that my order was violated
by Comrade Hor because as far as I know nobody dared to violate
my order.  The westerners, they came in pair, and at that time
Nuon Chea said the long nosed prisoners should be taken out and I
was ordered by him to burn them to ashes and not to leave any
remaining behind.  And after I received the instruction I gave my
instruction to Hor and both of them were burned at the same time,
they were burned to ashes not leave any remaining on that road.
So I still believe the testimony of Comrade Huy and I still have
a firm belief that nobody dared to violate my order.  This is my
observation, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness Cheam Sour, for coming to provide your
testimony to the Chamber as summonsed by us and the hearing of
your testimony has come to an end now.   And indeed the Chamber
acknowledges the challenges and difficulties that you faced in
providing your testimony in responding to the several questions
put to you by the Chamber and the parties to the proceedings.
And another matter is that what happened has been more than 30
years ago and only now we try to understand what happened and
this gap has been so long that the recollection by anybody would
not be perfect.  And it is also based on the individual knowledge
of understanding of the facts of the situation that happened at
that time.  With a limited knowledge or understanding then it
would be difficult to describe those events after a long period
of time, like in your case.
So you are now excused.
(Witness exits courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the Court officer, you need to make necessary arrangements
for the witness to return to his residence by working in
cooperation with the WESU Unit.
For this afternoon the Chamber would like to inform the parties
and the public that we will continue our proceeding starting from
1.30 p.m.
And based on our scheduling of the trial, actually we planned to
have one day to hear the testimony of this witness, however, the
testimony ended earlier, therefore this afternoon the Chamber
will continue to read the statements of five witnesses whom the
Chamber decides not to have them to provide verbal testimony
before the Chamber, and the Greffiers will read those
testimonies.  Those testimonies were made before the
Co-Investigating Judges.  We will continue reading those
statements from yesterday and two more witnesses; that is Saom
Samul and Chey Sopheara.
Security guard, take the accused back to the detention facility
and bring him back before one thirty this afternoon.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The hearing is now adjourned.
THE GREFFIER:
All rise.
(Judges exit courtroom)
(Court recesses from 1203H to 1332H)
(Judges enter courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated.  The Court is now in session.
In the next proceeding, we're going to hear the statement being

Question and answer:
Q. I want you to briefly describe your history prior to 1970.
A. Prior to 1970, I studied at the Sampan Kraom school and when I
reached class 8, seeing my parents in difficulty, I stopped my
studies.  I then helped my parents with work until 1970.
Q. And after the coup, what did you do?
A. Then we were united into groups within a farming co-operative.
Q. What did you do after that?
A. I worked until '74.  In 1974, they forced me into Pol Pot's
revolution.  The subdistrict militia chased and surrounded me. I
had fled to the east bank.  Later they arrested me and put me in
prison at Prek Tauch.
Q. How many years did they imprison you?
A. They imprisoned me for five months.  Then my younger sibling,
who was one of Ta Nat's soldiers, came to liberate me from prison
and took me to Prey Sva Village, Kandal Steung.
Q. Your brother, your younger brother, had joined the army before
you?
A.  Yes.
Q.  What is your younger brother's name?
A.  Nhep Peng.
Q. After you went with Nhep Peng, what unit were you in?
A. At first I was in the economics unit, Battalion 112, Regiment
73, Division 12.
Q. Please continue.
A.  In the Pol Pot era I worked in the 112th in the economics
unit.
Q. Did you ever transfer to a different unit?
A. No, I was only in economics in the 112th.
Q. In what year did you come to serve at S-21?
A.  March 1977.  Van was the one who took me to work at S-21.
Q. Who was Van?
A. He was the chairman of an economics unit of the 50.
Q.   Van was chairman of economics of the 50 where?
A. Van was chairman of the economics unit of 50 in the Battalion
112.
Q. When they called you to S-21 did they tell you they were
taking you to that place?
A. Before Van took me I asked Vorn, "Comrade, where are you
taking me?"  Van said, "Why do you want to know?  When you get
there you will surely know."
Van took me behind him on his bicycle.  I kept on asking him
along the way, "Are we nearly there?"  Vorn said we were almost
there and it was then that Van brought me to S-21.  The guard
spat and said, "Come here, Comrades, you are in prison again."
Q. Who said that?
A. A guard guarding S-21.
Q. Did you know each other?  And so was that why he said that?
A. I did not know him before.
Q. So you waited for Van outside?
A. I waited outside.
Q. Continue please.
A. Later, Van came out and said, "Comrade, you can go inside now
because I have spoken with Comrade Hor."  So I went inside.
Q. At first what tasks did they assign you to do?
A. I was a guard for prisoners.
Q. Guarding inside or outside?
A. Guarding inside in the upper building.
Q. The inside guards, how many teams were they divided into?
A. 10 teams.
Q. And which building was your team in charge of guarding?
A. We relieved each other.  Five teams guarded from six to 11 and
another five teams continued in the afternoon.
Q. Where was your team responsible for guarding, regardless of
the timing?
A. The north building on the right-hand side:  Building C.
Q. Each team was responsible for one building?
A. They divided up 10 teams, five teams at a time, relieved by
five other teams.  We relieved each other as we went along.
Q. Explain the task of guarding.  What did you do?
A. The guards took care of the prisoners, defended, carried the
food, and brought out the excrement.
Q. Regarding the instructions given to the guards relating to
prisoners, what instructions were given?
A. Upper echelon instructed not to talk loudly to the prisoners,
to talk quietly and not to beat the prisoners.  And upper echelon
instructed that when the time came to carry the gruel, the rice,
for the prisoners to eat.
Q. If the prisoners wanted to go out to relieve themselves, who
was responsible for that?
A. That was not permitted when we guarded the first floor of that
building.  They had a device prepared for the prisoners to
relieve themselves right there.
Q. Please explain clearly how the prisoners relieved themselves.
What did you have them do to relieve themselves?
A. An ammunition case was kept for the prisoners to relieve
themselves.
Q. So for the prisoners who were shackled, how could they relieve
themselves?  Please explain.
A. The prisoners relieved themselves; they were not in shackles
there.  They used an ammunition case for the prisoners to
defecate in and after they had relieved themselves we, the
guards, shut the ammunition case and carried it out.
Q. You say the prisoners were not shackled.  The prisoners had
the right to walk freely?
A. In the place where I guarded upstairs, there the prisoners
were not handcuffed.
Q. You only guarded the upper floors there?
A. I guarded the whole upper floor.  The ground and second
floors, that was the work of others.
Q. On the upper floor were the prisoners in large cells or small
ones?  Were there the prisoners in large cells or small ones --
correction.
A. On the upper floor there were large cells.
Q. None of those prisoners were kept in shackles?
A. There were none, just on the ground floor and first floor.
Those prisoners upstairs had already been interrogated before
being placed on the upper floor.  Let me explain:  there was the
ground, first floor, the second floor, and I was on the third
floor.
Q. So the prisoners who had not yet been interrogated were put on
the ground floor?
A. Placed on the first floor next to the ground floor.
Q. Please explain:  the prisoner cells which you guarded, were
they for men, women, and children mixed together, or what?
A. The cells I guarded, there was a cell for women and children
and other cells for the men.  That place was for prisoners who
had been interrogated.  That place had three large cells.
Q. Tell me about the cell for women and children.  Were there
many children?
A. The cell for the mothers and children held about seven
children and aside from them some women and some elderly people.
Q. Do you know where they took those mothers and children to
later on?
A. The mothers and children, later on Huy's team came and took
them.  At 7 o'clock they brought a vehicle to take them.  They
did not take them all.  They took prisoners from other cells too.
Q. Seven at night or in the morning?
A. Seven at night.  Huy's team came to take them.
Q. As far as you know, where did they take them?
A. That was their law.  They said Huy had come to get them.
They came up to get them, Huy's team.  We could not ask anything.
Whenever we asked anything they said we were enemies of the
revolution.
Q. When Huy's team came to take the prisoners how did they make
contact with the guards?
A. Huy entered the compound.  I could see that from upstairs.
They mostly contacted Hor and Thy, the one who kept the lists.
There was only Hor below Duch.
Q. You were a guard, so the cell keys were all with you?
A. I was a guard.  There were three of us on the upper floor.
The keys, whenever I carried the gruel I gave them to the other
two guards.  We took turns.
Q. So your instructions depended on the team coming to take the
prisoners?  You just had the order to unlock and lock them up?
A. Just to unlock and lock them up.
Q. In your duties as a prisoner guard what was the condition of
the prisoners you observed?
A. The prisoners I guarded on the upper floor were in weak
state from torture and beatings and I saw that.  One prisoner
called out, "Brother, put ointment on my back a little for me.
It hurts very badly."  I called a medic to clean the wounds.
Q. Were there other instances you saw?
A. When I was guarding there not much happened.  I saw that
when they had finished interrogating them they kept them at that
place.  But there were many skinny prisoners because the torture
was severe.
Q. How could you recognize the prisoners who had been severely
tortured?
A. They brought those prisoners upstairs.  They had finished
interrogating them.  The prisoners never told me.  Some prisoners
told me, "Brother, they beat me hard", but I did not dare say
anything because I was afraid that if they came to interrogate
them again they would implicate me.
Q. Explain.  On the upper floor there was a cell for women and
children.  Did you ever see them kill children in that cell?
A. If I talk about the moments when I was guarding that did not
happen.  If Huy's group had done that there would have been a
reaction from the prisoners.
Q. Explain further.  In the place where you were on guard was
there ever crying and screaming?
A. There was wailing.  It's not like there was none but when I
heard the wailing I called a medic because I was afraid that if a
prisoner died they would accuse me of being an enemy.
Q. Did you ever see a prisoner die in there?
A. Yes, I did.  An interrogator came to take a prisoner from
the upper floor and then the interrogator released the hands of
that prisoner.  That prisoner jumped from the building and died.
I saw that with my own eyes.
Q. Did you take prisoners from the detention site to
interrogation or was that another team?
A. I just locked and unlocked and that interrogator recognized
him and took that prisoner right away.  And when they were
leaving when that interrogator had just released his hand a
little, that prisoner then jumped from the building.
Q. So the interrogators came to get the prisoners themselves.
Can you remember the names of those interrogators who came to get
prisoners?
A. I cannot remember the names because I did not dare ask.
Those who came to get them were all Duch's people.
Q. Regarding Duch, did you see Duch come to the detention site
often?
A. When I was on guard Duch came often but only to meet with
Hor.  He did not come to the building.
Q. You said that Duch came to inspect the prison and only met
with Hor, and Hor was your superior.  In your opinion, who then
was Duch's?
A. When I was at S-21 there was only Duch and Hor.  Duch was
the big Chairman and Hor was deputy.  And Huy at Prey Sar was
member, the tall and dark Huy.
Q. You said that you knew Duch, Hor and Huy.  Aside from them
whom else did you know, like the chairman of the outside guards?
A. Inside S-21 there I cannot remember all the names but I knew
some inside like Pauch in an S-21 company; Thai, the head of an
S-21 company; Phau, head of an S-21 company, and the heads of
units of 50:  Sreng, Eng and Sry.
I forget the names of three other heads of battalions.  There
were six in total.  Those outside were Huy, Man, Srim.  Those who
made the arrests and took them in and out were all in that team.
That team was at the sewer ditch to the west.  I did not know the
interrogators well.
Q. Among those names, aside from Huy are any still alive?
A. All of those I named are dead aside from Huy.
Q. Did you have any siblings working at S-21?
A. At S-21 Prison my younger brother worked there too.  His name
was Peng.
Q. What did Peng do?
A. When Huy had arrested everyone my brother rose to company
leader with Thy.
Q. Is Peng still alive?
A. Dead.  Peng died at Pailin.  He was with Duch.  Someone came
and told me he had died during the war after '79.
Q. In what year did he die?
A. I don't remember the year.
Q. Do you know Chan?
A. Chan, probably.  If he was an interrogator I know him.
Q. When you were working there did you ever participate in
meetings or political study sessions led by Duch?
A. When I was at S-21 I studied.  I went to them because they
changed the times for the guard shifts.  Duch called the guards
to that school near Duch's house and Duch gave instructions on
what guards were to do to closely guard.  And what anyone who let
a prisoner escape would die.  Duch said that we had to firmly
believe in the revolution and not get reckless in guarding.  Duch
pointed as he spoke.  He said a lot but I cannot remember it all.
Q. How many times did you go study?
A. When I was at S-21 I went to study just once at the school
near Duch's house.
Q. Did you ever participate in meetings with anyone other than
Duch?
A. At S-21 I never did with senior people, just with Huy and
Thy's group, they are the only ones I knew, and with the company
and unit of 50 leaders who died.
Q. Please explain a little regarding the names you just spoke of,
those who had all been arrested.  Did you ever guard any of them?
A. The group Huy arrested was never placed in the north building.
They put them in the south building, beginning with the head of
the S-21 youth group.  They were never placed in the north.  They
were all put in the south building.
Q. Who supervised the south building?
A. I do not know their names.  Because all of the guards,
including me, whatever building they guarded, that was the
building we knew.  That was Duch's law.
Q. The people supervising inside, your fellow guards, they could
not contact each other?
A. Duch did not permit contact between any of the guards because
the guards who remained were all from Ta Nat's network, so they
restricted them and did not allow contact.  If there was contact
the person making contact was an enemy.  If they checked and
learned about it they would put you in prison.
Q. Those who worked at S-21, many of them were killed.  What were
the reasons for those killings?  Was it because of Ta Nat, or
what?
A. Inside S-21 the people in the company were all from Ta Nat's
network and Duch brought in his forces in addition, so Duch
prohibited contact with Ta Nat's network.
Q. Please explain more.  Regarding the arrest of the company
cadres at S-21, what arrest method did you notice?
A. I did not know if they were arrested or not.  I was only
guarding upstairs.  I stood and watched the people in the
company, the team chairman, as they were called at Huy's place at
the sewer ditch, and they were arrested.  When they came back
blindfolded I just knew they had been arrested.
Q. Which Huy?
A. You Huy, alias Him Huy.
Q. Who gave the orders for them to go meet Huy?
A. I don't know who made the decisions.
Q. Among all the prisoners at S-21 did you ever see any foreign
prisoners?
A. There were none at my place.  In other places I suspect there
were.  They were in different buildings.
Q. Regarding feeding prisoners, how many times did they eat each
day and what food was there each time?
A. At the site I was guarding there were three loads of shoulder
pole carried rice in large buckets and one load of shoulder pole
carried soup.  I put a food bucket in each cell and let the
prisoners scoop it out themselves, and the leftovers I put
outside the cell.  If there was any shortage I added more
afterwards.  Each day I prepared food for the prisoners twice, at
noon and in the afternoon.
Q. For how many prisoners?
A. The site I guarded had about 80.
Q. Regarding the distribution of food, did the prisoners have
their own dishes or was it one common dish?
A. There were dishes for each prisoner but I prepared three
dishes of soup for 20 prisoners.
Q. Did you think that was sufficient?
A. Sometimes it was not enough.  As far as rice is concerned, it
was little but not very little, but the drained soup was very
little.
Q. In general, the food was not sufficient for the prisoners?
A. I said sometimes enough, sometimes not, because that was all
they got as food rations.
Q. As for the prisoners in place other than yours, was the food
ration the same?
A. The same food ration in general, because the cooks ladled out
the same food for everyone.
Interrupted the hearing of the statement at 11.50 hours in the
morning of the same day.
Continued the hearing of the statement at 1.20 hours in the
afternoon of the same day.
Q. Regarding the food ration for the combatants at S-21, how was
it?
A. The food ration of the S-21 combatants was prepared by the
economics team, 10 persons at each table.
Q. How many times a day and was it sufficient?
A. Food for the defence was too little sometimes, sometimes it
was enough.  That depended upon the S-21 economics team.
Q. Sufficient?  How many times?
A. Two times, the same at noon and in the afternoon.
Q. How did you eat?  Could you take more on your own?
A. There was just one pot.
Q. How many items of food?
A. One, sometimes two.
Q. When compared with the food of the prisoners which you
explained this morning, how was it different?
A. Food for prisoners and for guards was only a little different.
The rice for the guards sometimes was not filling but with one
dish of drained soup it was.
Q. You said most of the prisoners were skinny because of not
eating enough.
A. The prisoners did not get enough to eat and had been tortured
too, so they were skinny.
Q. But the people who worked at S-21 were not as skinny as the
prisoners?
A. The people at S-21 were not very skinny because no-one had
tortured them.
Q. So you noted that the prisoners had been tortured, or what?
A. I noticed that 100 percent of the prisoners had been tortured.
Q. Can you explain what torture was inflicted on the prisoners?
A. I did not know about the torture because we were far apart but
I just said that when I guarded in the prison when prisoners
returned they had whip marks.
Q. The living conditions of the prisoners as you saw them, did
the prisoners have enough clothing?
A. The prisoners I guarded sometimes had enough, sometimes not.
Q. How would you note that prisoners did not have enough
clothing?
A. Prisoners were short of clothing because their shirts had been
torn during torture and the prisoners had no change of clothing.
Q. In summary, you saw that some prisoners had no shirts?
A. Yes.  I observed in guarding that they had been tortured until
their shirts were torn, sometimes to the point the shirt had to
be thrown away.
Q. Did you ever see medics treat prisoners right there where you
were working?
A. There were two medics in the prison where I was.
Q. Hygiene for prisoners, washing, how was that done?
A. For those of us guarding the prisoners there was a pump below
a hose above to wash the prisoners.  They had proper soap.
Q. Please tell us clearly about washing prisoners.
A. I had the prisoners in the cells wash one at a time and there
was a bag of soap.  After they washed I took it to prisoners in
another cell to wash.
Q. You hosed the prisoners down or let them wash by themselves?
A. I let them wash one at a time and when they finished I removed
the hose for the other cells.
Q. So it was a sleeping place and a washing place too?
A. They slept there and they washed there.  When they washed and
dried themselves off they rested.
Q. How many times was each prisoner washed each week?
A. Prisoners were washed twice a day; noon and afternoon.
Q. Prisoners in buildings other than yours, were they washed in
the same way?
A. In general, washing in the other buildings was the same
because law was to wash the prisoners twice at every site.
Q. When did you leave S-21?
A. I left S-21 when Phnom Penh fell.  We all fled together.  We
ran along the back of the prison and met at Prey Sar and we all
fled to Amleang, Kampong Speu.
Q. Please explain.  When you ran away, the prisoners you were
guarding, how were they arranged?
A. The prisoners I was guarding, Huy's group, one unit of 50, had
them taken away in truckloads.  I don't know where they took
them.
Q. For how many days were they transported until they were all
gone?
A. After about 10 days the prisoners were all gone.
Q. So when the defence units fled, the S-21 prisoners were
already gone?
A. They were all gone before the defence unit fled from the
prison through the kitchens.
Q. Did you flee along with your younger brother?
A. No, I fled with the defence unit, not with my younger brother.
Q. Did you meet Duch when you fled?
A. No.  There were many fleeing.  I never fled with Duch.  I ran
with the defence unit.  We all fled to Prey Sar.
Q. This is a photo of prisoners who died right there at S-21 --
'Night of the Khmer Rouge' .  Did you know about the
prisoners who died at Tuol Sleng?
A. It was the guards in the south building, Building A, who
killed prisoners before they fled.
Q. But not in your building?
A. No.
Q. In this photo a prisoner had shot himself -- 'Night of the
Khmer Rouge',  -- by stealing a gun to shoot himself.
A. That was Hor's place.  Suos Thy knows about that too.
Q. Do you know where Hor was?
A. When we fled we got separated.  Hor fled to Amleang and I did
not go.
Q. You said you went to Amleang too.
A. I did not cross.  The plan was to have everyone cross National
Highway Number 4 to Amleang.  The Vietnamese were firing.  I ran
across.  Then I ran to the west to another province.
Q. Do you know where Hor is today?
A. What I know, what I just learned, is that Hor was shot and
killed by Duch group.
Q. Do you have anything to add for us?
A. Everything I have said is the truth.  I have said everything I
know.  What I have said I have seen with my own eyes or heard
with my ears.  I have spoken from my heart about my life inside
S-21.
Q. After you left S-21 did you ever meet your younger brother
again?
A. When S-21 fell I never saw him and I don't know where my
brother is.  When the government negotiated with the Khmer Rouge
people in Pailin returned to the village and they told me.
The hearing of the witness's statement was concluded at two
forty-two in the afternoon of the same day.
We hope that when the ECCC requires it you will continue to
cooperate.
One copy of the written record was provided to the witness.
After it was read aloud the witness had no objections and agreed
to sign.  Witness Nhep Hau."
MR. PRESIDENT:
After hearing the Greffier reading the record of interview of
witness Nhep Hau, do the Co-Prosecutors have any observations to
make regarding this statement?
MR. YET CHAKRIYA:
Thank you, Mr. President.
Regarding the testimony of Nhep Hau as read by the Greffier, the
Co-Prosecutors do not have any observations to make.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The civil party counsel, do you have any observations to make
regarding the content of the testimony as read by the Greffier?
MR. WERNER:
None, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the defence counsel, do you have any observations to make
regarding the content of the testimony of this statement as read
by the Greffier?
The witness's name is Nhep Hau.
MR. ROUX:
Thank you, Mr. President.
On behalf of the defence I would like to make an observation,
which is perhaps of a more general nature.
When the Chamber decided not to call a number of witnesses to
testify in person it was a wise decision.  Since that decision
was taken -- that is, since the 23rd of June 2009, that is more
than a month ago -- since the 29th of June 2009 we have heard
many witnesses before this Court.
The question that should be put today is this: in light of the
total information that witnesses have provided to the Court
concerning the accused's admission of facts, what is the
contribution of the statements we are reading out now?  What is
the extra information these statements provide?
I would like, respectfully, to draw the attention of the Chamber
to article 85 of our regulations, which says that after
consultation of the other Judges, the President of the Chamber
may exclude from the proceedings any material that tends to
extend them unnecessarily without contributing to the
ascertainment of the truth.
The same can be seen in Rule 87, where it is said that the
Chamber can declare -- can find a piece of evidence inadmissible
if it finds that a) it is irrelevant or repetitious, and
therefore, this is what we are facing now.  We have an accused
who has admitted all the facts charged; witnesses who have come
to this Court on several occasions to confirm what the accused
has said.  It seems to me, Mr. President, Your Honours, that at
this stage in the proceedings the ideal procedure would be to
request that the office of the Co-Prosecutors should set out for
the benefit of the Chamber what new and relevant facts can be
found in these statements that are yet to be read.
In the admission of facts by the accused there is a small number
of points that he contested.  Can we hope that the Prosecutors
will henceforth focus on those points and do the witnesses whose
statements they want to put before the Court provide relevant
information pertaining to the points contested by the accused?
I have said before that if these were common-law proceedings with
an accused who admits his responsibility, this trial would be
over, but what is ironical here is that if we were in completely
civil law proceeding, the trial would be over as well.
Mr. President, Your Honours, I have the impression that we are
repeating ourselves needlessly, and I reiterate my request: the
Co-Prosecutors can point out the relevant facts that require us
to suffer through these entire reading of the statements.
These are my submissions.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The international Co-Prosecutor, you may proceed.
MR. AHMED:
Thank you, Your Honour, for this opportunity.
I think my learned friend did not get the question from Mr.
President when Your Honour the President requested his
observations regarding this particular witness.  If my learned
friend were to object only for non-inclusion of this particular
witness then he should say so.  This, Your Honours, is not an
occasion for deciding whether a particular witness should be
called live, as we call it, in this Court or not.  These matters
were discussed in at least two Trial Management meetings.
Now, the lists that Your Honours received were of course given by
parties but ultimately the lists that Your Honour finally decided
of the witnesses to be called in the Court were Your Honours'
lists.  Your Honours in your wisdom decided to call x number of
witnesses to this Court and in your wisdom decided not to call
certain witnesses.  Your Honours also decided to not read the
number of many witnesses in this Court.
So I think Your Honours have applied your minds, Your Honours
have made a decision in respect of which witnesses to be called,
the witnesses whose testimony is to be read in the Court and the
prosecution and the parties' observations to be taken.  This
matter has taken place and it is finished.  At this stage so late
in the proceedings is not the appropriate time to once again go
back and open the entire witness list that Your Honours so very
acidulously prepared in consultation with the parties.
Now, clearly there shall be and will be, as it is the case in
such big trials -- and my learned friend is an experienced
counsel in such trials.  There may be repetition.  After all,
it's about one accused, it's about one security centre but there
are -- as Your Honours have very well seen and public has seen
and parties have seen, every witness has brought in some new
element to this trial and parties, with Your Honours' directions,
have tried to focus on those particular elements in that
witness's testimony.
So I'd most respectfully submit my learned friend should clearly
indicate whether he wants this witness's testimony to be admitted
into evidence without calling this witness and, to Your Honours,
to not permit the defence, or indeed any other party, to reopen
the entire witness list which, with the consultation of the
parties, was very properly created by Your Honours.
I would just conclude that this is not a time to debate whether
these are civil law proceedings or common law proceedings.  We
are guided by the rules and statutes of this Court and Your
Honours, in application of those rules and statutes, have called
these witnesses.  So we should not get into these endless debates
of whether it's a civil law proceeding or a common law
proceeding.  Ultimately it's Your Honours' decision on the basis
of rules of this Court.
I thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. François Roux, you take the floor.
MR. ROUX:
Well, Mr. President, in that case, so that we can move ahead as
the Co-Prosecutor is suggesting, the defence is therefore
requesting the application of Rule 85 of the Internal Rules and
the defence is kindly requesting that you confer with the other
Judges and that you exclude from the proceedings the statement
that has just been read out, as well as all of the following
statements that are planned to be read out, because the defence
believes that these statements are prolonging the proceedings
uselessly without contributing to the ascertainment of truth.
This is clearly the submission of the defence while reminding at
the same time that the Chamber has made its decision on the 29th
of June, it had not yet questioned orally all of the witnesses
who appeared before the Court, so today we are in a different
situation from that of the 29th of June and the Chamber is much
better informed than it was on the 29th of June.
So therefore we are kindly requesting the exclusion of all of
these documents, noting Rule 85 of the Internal Rules as well as
Rule 87, insofar that these documents are not relevant or are
repetitious.
Thank you very much, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Co-Prosecutor, you take the floor.
MR. AHMED:
Your Honours, I shall not respond to what my learned friend said,
otherwise it will become endless, but just a suggestion for Your
Honours' consideration.
May I bring to your attention Rule 87.3 and that may address the
time issue that my learned friend has raised.  Rule 87.3 permits
Your Honours to take into evidence any matter that has been
either summarized or read into evidence.  It may be possible,
subject to Your Honours' leave, to request your Greffiers just to
read a summary of any statement and not read it in totality.
That may take care of the requirements that it's been brought to
the attention of the public -- because it's, after all, a public
trial -- but it shall also ensure an expeditious conduct of this
trial.  But that's only a submission.  I shall leave it to Your
Honours.
Thank you very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Lawyer Studzinsky, you take the floor.
MS. STUDZINSKY:
Thank you, Mr. President.
I would like to object to the motion of the defence, or
application of the defence, insofar that witness statements are
concerned where we objected their removal from the witness list.
The Chamber announced in public, I would say after one of the
Trial Management meetings that would be about the end of June --
announced which witnesses we wanted to be heard in Court and at
least which witnesses we want to read out their statements.
I don't want to repeat them or, if so, then I need five minutes
to recollect these witness names and their statements but I refer
to what the Chamber -- I remember Judge Cartwright told the
public concerning these witnesses.  And I also emphasize which
parts of the testimony are of relevance and are unique and
therefore these witnesses should be heard or at least their
statements should be read out.
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. François Roux, you take the floor.
Please be reminded that this would be the last opportunity to
respond to this matter.
MR. ROUX:
Thank you, Mr. President.
And thank you, Mr. Co-Prosecutor, for his constructive
suggestion.  Summaries, yes, why not, indeed.  And in order to
avoid, indeed, repetition, can we maybe ask the prosecutors to
tell us which is the relevant element in the statements that will
provide something new to the debate.  A summary, yes, but a
summary of the relevant elements that offer something new to the
debate so that we do not fall into repetition, such as it is
noted in Articles 85 and 87.  This is my submission which follows
the constructive suggestions by the Co-Prosecutors.
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you very much for all the observations made by the
parties to the proceeding.  We note that they are all good
purposes to ascertain the truth and that we would like the more
expeditious proceedings and all the remarks are well noted and
the Chamber will discuss and find a way to deal with the
witnesses statements, those who only want to have their
statements read out in the Chamber, especially those whose
statements were made before the Co-Investigators.  And we
appreciate your comments.
We would like now to give the opportunity to the accused to make
his observation in relation to the statement as read out already,
the statement of witness Nhep Hau.
You take the floor.
THE ACCUSED:
Mr. President, I do know Comrade Nhep Hau alias Van, who worked
at S-21 all together with me.
I would like to now tell the Court about the characteristics of
Comrade Van and Hor.  They were not the same.  The statement,
however, will show as the mirror to reflect the situations of the
detainees and how detainees were treated at S-21.  And that is
all I would like to tell the Court.
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Since it is convenient time to take an adjournment we will take
the adjournment now and resume at 3 o'clock.
(Judges exit courtroom)
(Court recesses from 1441H to 1552H)
(Judges enter courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated.  The Chamber is now back in session.
Before the Greffier is instructed to read the statement of the
witness, the Chamber will make an oral decision in response to
the request by the defence counsel as follows.
The Chamber has noted the request made by the defence counsel for
the review of the list of statements to be read during the
proceedings.  The Chamber will review the list of the statements
as it intended to be read and it will decide which statements to
be read out and which need to be summarized or identified.
In the meantime, and for practical reasons, the Trial Chamber
will continue to read the statement in full for the rest of this
afternoon as scheduled.
The Greffier Se Kolvuthy is instructed to read a statement of the
records of interview of witness Kung Phai, D28/1, D53, D54, and
D48/2.
THE GREFFIER:
"Office of the Co-Investigating Judges, Criminal Case File Number
002 dated 14 August 2006, Investigation Number 001 dated 18 July
2007.  Written record of interview of witness, the year 2007, the
month of December, the 27th day at nine hours 30 minutes at the
Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia.
I, Sim Surya, investigator of the Extraordinary Chambers,
assigned by the rogatory letter of the Co-Investigating Judges
dated 21st November 2007, met the witness Kung Phai on
19   December 2007 at his home in Kampong Tralach district, Kampong
Chhnang province.  Since he was busy he requested that we
interview him at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of
Cambodia on 27 December 2007.
Having seen the Law on the Establishment of the Extraordinary
Chambers dated 27 October 2004, having seen Rules 24, 28 and 60
of the Internal Rules of the Extraordinary Chambers, have
recorded the statements of Kung Phai, a witness, who provided the
following information regarding his personal identity:  name,
Kung Phai; revolutionary name, none; born on 4th of May 1960.
This person declared that he could read, write, and understand
the Khmer language, therefore the original of this written record
is written in the Khmer language.  We advised this person that
the taking of this statement is being audio or video recorded.
This person told us that he had no relationship with the charged
persons and civil parties.  This person took an oath in
accordance with the provisions of Rule 24 of the Internal Rules
of the Extraordinary Chambers.
We notified this person of the right against self-incrimination
in accordance with the provisions of Rule 28 of the Internal
Rules of the Extraordinary Chambers.
Question and Answer.
Q. On 17 April 1975, where were you and what were you doing?
A. I was in the Peani South District Militia, Kampong Tralach
District, Kampong Chhnang Province.  I transported food supplies
from the subdistrict to the battlefield front at Spean.  The
subdistrict militia had grown that rice on its own.  The leader
of the subdistrict militia was Ta Poeun, also from Kampong
Tralach district, and Ta Yim was the District Military Chief.
I took those supplies to subdistrict militia forces stationed
there to attack and cut off communication between Lon Nol troops.
Q. Can you please describe your journey from Kampong Chhnang to
Phnom Penh?
A. In early 1976, I left the subdistrict for Phnom Penh.  There
was three of us from the same district.  One has died, the other
is still alive, Set, living at Kreang Ta Ek village, Peany
subdistrict, Kampong Tralach district, Kampon Chhnang province.
Set started at the Ta Khmau training school, but he did not work
at S-21.  I don't know who transported me from the subdistrict
because they came to get us at night.  I studied military
subjects at the Ta Khmau school for three months and 28 days.
The chairman was Yem in charge of military techniques.
Q. When did you arrive at S-21?
A. I went to a huge unit along the river south of Ta Khmau for
one dry season before I went to the former Prey Sar Prison in
1977.
I was there throughout the rainy season in a children's unit with
hundreds of children doing rice transplanting and coconut tree
planting.  I knew Try, a child medic at Prey Sar, I don't know
where he is now.  He had a large and tall build, a clear
complexion, a slow, graceful gait, and straight hair.
Later. I went to Boeng Tumpun for one dry season to work during
the dry season rice and plant Chinese radishes.  The team leader
was Phorn.  He had one crippled arm.  We separated when the
Vietnamese came.
Later, I went to tend the crops, grow pumpkins and soybeans south
of the psychiatric hospital.  I saw shackles and bloodstains in
the three-storey, concrete building, and saw shallowly buried
bodies swelling up and cracking the ground in the compound.  It
looked like a prison which had just ceased operations, but I
don't know who the prisoners had been.
I can't remember the senior chairman there.  I was there
throughout one wet season.
Q. What next?
A. I went to Office S-21.  The same person named Pon came to take
me there.  In mid-1977, I arrived at S-21, first as a guard along
the walls with Mau who had a disease and died in 1978, as my
chairman.  Hieng was a colleague who was relieved by my shifts.
I don't know where he is now.  He was alive in 1979.
The chairman above Mau was Sry.  A platoon leader; I don't know
where he is now.  He was alive in 1979.  I can't remember the
other chairman.  The senior chairman was Duch.  I did not know
Pauch.
Q. What did you see while on guard outside?
A. I saw them taking prisoners in and out.  I opened the gate by
recognizing the faces of the interrogators going in an out, one
of whom was Tuy; white, tall, awkward gait.  I don't know where
he is now.  He was alive in 1979.
In 1978, I saw three Americans brought in through the entrance I
was guarding, the entrance to the south of the present entrance;
the place where they kept important prisoners.  All three of them
were held on the second floor in the different cells.  I saw
Duch, Hor, and Chan Samreng come to interrogate them.
Then I took rice to one of the three and I saw Duch interrogating
that man with long, curly, red hair down to his shoulders.  He
was of white complexion with chest hair, wearing shorts.  Before
Duch interrogated him, he was wearing a short-sleeved camouflage
T-shirt.  Then Hieng, who had the next shift at night, told me
that they had taken all three of them away.  I did not know
where, and they disappeared after that.
Sometimes I guarded the cells and saw Vietnamese female prisoners
arrive.  I was a guard and I brought food for them.  I learned
from an interrogator that those women had been the prostitutes of
the Vietnamese soldiers whom the Khmer Rouge soldiers had
attacked, and they had been captured and brought in.
I guarded one male Vietnamese soldier.  Later on, I went to guard
the gate at the wall, and I don't know where he went to.  I did
not know the names of the senior prisoners.  Sometimes I took
prisoners who were handcuffed and blindfolded to be interrogated
at other places, east of my site.
Q. Were you there until the end?
A. I was there until S-21 fell in 1979.
Q. Did you ever study under or receive instructions from Duch?
A. I studied twice for about two or three days each time.  I
studied preventing prisoner escapes; the Party statute; the
political situation; and the war.  Duch taught this in person.
He said the youth are the Party's bamboo sprouts which replace
the bamboo.
Q. Did Duch and Hor get along personally?
A. I saw them work together normally.  Chhen, who was Duch's
messenger, his description: clear complexion, strong build,
average height, thick body, he was not married at that time, his
place of birth was Amleang.
Q. Did you see any of those who were with you get arrested?
A. I never saw that.  I just know we separated in 1979.
Q. Did you know anyone else; in what sections?
A. The most senior person was Duch.  Next was Hor, the deputy.
Chan Samreng was the member.  The guard, interrogation and arrest
units, the cooks, the medical unit.  Sre was chairman of my guard
unit.  Huy Him, or short Huy and Peng were the chairmen of the
arrest unit.  That unit used about four or five Soviet and
Chinese trucks to go make arrests in the zones.
Aside from this, I have forgotten everything.
Q. Did you ever see them take blood from the prisoners?
A. Never.
Q. Did you ever see interrogators torture prisoners?
A. I did see that. I saw interrogators beating prisoners with
whips, giving them electrical shocks.  I heard the screams of the
prisoners.  I saw medics come to treat injured prisoners.  All of
the interrogators tortured prisoners.  Tuy was an interrogator
too.
Q. This principle of torture, did Duch order that?
A. Yes.  I learned that from Duch at the school from the
company chairman, the platoon chairman.  They said that the
prisoners were enemies and if they did not answer they could be
tortured.
Q. When you fled in 1979 what were the orders of Duch about
what was to be done with the prisoners?
A. By that time there were no prisoners at the site I gathered.
Several days before 7January 1979 I was sent to guard at the big
building, at the days entrance gate.  Since there were so many
prisoners those prisoners were killed, some at Tuol Sleng and
some were transported to Choeung Ek.  They were all gone before
we fled.  I saw this killing with my own eyes.  I did not see
Duch there.  But if he had not arranged it no one would have
dared to do it.
Q. Many thanks.

to sign.  One copy of one of several originals of the written
statement was provided to this witness. The interview was

interrogating prisoners but I did not see him torture them.
Q. During the reconstitution at Tuol Sleng you indicated that you
indeed witnessed the presence and use of a bathtub such as the
one in the museum and painted by Vann Nath.  Do you confirm you
saw this in a building outside of Tuol Sleng?
A. Yes, I confirm, in the special prison located outside Tuol
Sleng.
Q. During the re-enactment at Tuol Sleng you said you recognized
the blackboard on which the Santebal regulations were written.
Can you explain in which condition did you see that blackboard?
A. That blackboard was put on the ground floor of the special
prison next to the pathway in order for everyone to follow.

2007, report on reconstruction in the year 2008 on the 27th of
February at 8.00 a.m., noting the judicial investigation opened
against Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, charged with crimes against
humanity and grave breaches of Geneva Conventions of the 12th of
August 1949, crimes defined and punishable under Rules 5, 6, 29
(new) and 39 (new) of the Law on the Establishment of the

Expert Zoran Lesic, designated by means of the ordinance dated
the 12th of February 2008 was also in attendance for the purpose
of this report and took the photographs which are featured to the
present report, Annex 1.
The charged person said that he knows Vann Nath, Bou Meng, Chum
Mey, Mam Nai, Suos Thy and Him Huy.  Witness Kung Phai stated
that he knows Duch, Mam Nai and Him Huy.  Witness Kung Phai
stated that after his stint as a guard outside he was assigned to
the special prison behind Building A.  He said that he saw Duch
come into the special prison to interrogate prisoners.  He added
that the guards here could not enter the special prison but the
ones from the special prison could come in here.
He was assigned to guard this building very shortly before the
Vietnamese arrived.  He said that he did not know all the
interrogators by name.  He described the various forms of
torture:  clamps in the toenails, ducking in ice water.  After
being interrogated the prisoners were taken to some other
locations but he does not know where.
With regard to the photo of prisoners lying down in a line, Vann
Nath explained that this is how he was held.  See the paragraph
number 9.1 below.
Witnesses Prak Khan and Kung Phai recognized that this type of
room existed.  Before the water tank, Suos Thy and Prak Khan
declared that the water tank did not exist at that time.  Kung
Phai explained that he saw that water tank outside the prison
compound and inside the special prison.  He added that the drum
on display near the bust was used to fill with iced water.  Other
witnesses provided some confirmations regarding the killing.
Kung Phai still insisted that he stood by his statement that he
was present during an execution at night.  He indicated that the
victims were buried next to the special prison inside the S-21
premises, as they were at the time of the events, but outside the
current premises.
The participants then left the room without any incident.  The
reconstruction was photographed and videoed and a copy of the
audio-video recording was given to the accused.  The original of
the report was written in the Khmer and French and then
translated into English.  The Greffiers, Ly Chantola, Ham Hel."
MR. PRESIDENT:

None, Your Honour, thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The defence counsel, do you have any observations you wish to

Greffier?  The statement belongs to the witness Kung Phai.
MR. ROUX:
Mr. President, the defence has a problem.  Could the Office of
the Co-Prosecutors indicate to the Court which of its witnesses
are telling the truth?  This witness contradicts a number of
statements that were made before this Chamber by other
prosecution witnesses.
I am referring, for example, to the fact that this witness said
that the Duch interviewed the prisoners himself, whereas other
prosecution witnesses have stated the contrary.  This witness
says there was a bathtub, and other prosecution witnesses say the
contrary.  While this witness says he saw the 10 rules of
discipline on the wall, this very morning another prosecution
witness said the exact opposite.
So this is my question for the Office of the Co-Prosecutors.  For
the transparency of proceedings, would you be so kind as to
indicate to the Chamber which of your witnesses is telling the
truth in order to support the work of the defence and to
ascertain the truth?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The international Co-Prosecutor, you may proceed.
MR. AHMED:
Your Honours, we all heard Your Honours' question to my learned
friend whether he objects to the admission of this witness
testimony into evidence without calling this witness to the
Court.  My learned friend, once again, did not respond to Your
Honours' question.
Responding to the matter raised by my learned friend, Your
Honours, being very experienced judges, are well aware that a
trial of this nature will clearly not have every witness
repeating the testimony as if every witness was telling the same
story.  They're all humans.  There are, at times, some
differences in the way one witness describes an event from the
way another witness describes an event.
I think it's early at this stage to get into this.  After all,
this is what Your Honours will do at judgement and this is what
we shall argue at the time of closing submissions as to the
weight to be assigned to the testimony of every witness heard by
Your Honours.
So my most respectful submission to Your Honours is:  it's
premature at this stage to get into who is right, who is wrong.
That's not my job.  It's Your Honours business to do, to
ascertain the truth.  After all, we are assisting Your Honours in
that matter.
I would most respectfully request my learned friend respond to
Your Honours question, whether he has any objection to the
admission of this particular witness's testimony.
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. François Roux, do you have anything to respond?
MR. ROUX:
Thank you, Mr. President.
Obviously, the defence is not disputing the putting of this
testimony before the Court.  What the defence wants is for the
prosecution to answer the question which was put; that is to say,
which of your witnesses is telling the truth in light of two
contradictory statements?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber would like to give the opportunity to the accused to
make his observations regarding the statements which were read by
the Greffier, if you wish to do so.
THE ACCUSED:
Mr. President, the general situation surrounding the crimes
committed at S-21, the testimony by Kung Phai is minimal.  It is
only a minimal part to assist the Chamber and the nations as a
whole to understand the truth.  Some events raised by Kung Phai
-- for example, regarding his allegation that I interrogated
prisoners -- this type of testimony, in addition to the alleged
10 regulations of Santebal on the blackboard, were extensively
discussed before this Chamber.  Reasons by both sides were put
before the Chamber, therefore, I think it is problematic with the
testimony of the witness, Kung Phai.
There is an English proverb that one swallow doesn't make a
season.  So this is up to the judgment of the Chamber, as it has
been discussed extensively, separately, regarding the youth whom
I requested from Kampong Chhnang.  I would make a summary on this
topic when the facts regarding those youths have been put before
the Chamber.
This is my response, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is now time for the adjournment.  The Chamber will adjourn the
proceeding today and we will resume our proceeding tomorrow
starting at 9 a.m.
And parties and the public are reminded that tomorrow the Chamber
will hear the testimony of an expert witness, David Chandler.
Security guard, take the accused back to the detention facility
and bring him back to the Chamber before 9 a.m.
The hearing is now adjourned.
THE GREFFIER:
All rise.
