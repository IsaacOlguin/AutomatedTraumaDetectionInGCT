QUESTIONING BY MR. SENG LEANG:
Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, Your Honours, and good
morning everyone in and around the courtroom.
Good morning, Mr. Witness. My name is Seng Leang, I am a National
Deputy Co-Prosecutor. I have some questions for you today in
order to seek your clarification for the benefit of the Chamber
and the Parties.
First of all I would like to ask some questions in relation to
your background and after that I'll put some questions in
relation to <cooperatives> and the subsequent subject is on the
treatment of Buddhists and the fourth subject is related to the
event that you were appointed as chief of the Hospital in Tram
Kak District. And after I conclude my questioning, my colleague
will have some further questions for you on other subject
matters.
Q. Let me begin with my first question. In your OCIJ interview --
that is, document E319.1.21, at answer number 3, you stated the
following and let me quote: "After the coup d'Ã©tat, against
Samdech Sihanouk, Ta Mok started his movement to assemble forces.
I lived in a village near the one where Ta Mok lived then and
because of that I joined the movement." End of quote. And at
question number 6 and let me quote the question: "Did you have
confidence in the Khmer Rouge revolution?" Answer: "I did have
confidence in it initially because of my communist ideology and
so I joined the revolution without hesitation." End of quote.
Also, in the same document, in answer number 200, you said and I
quote: "Initially I loved the revolution but later on when I
heard of the Cultural Revolution, I stopped liking it right
away." Can you tell the Chamber what was it specifically that
caused you to no longer like the revolution?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. The reason that I no longer had confidence in the revolution,
because I heard that such a cultural revolution and from what I
read in documents while I was young, that that kind of revolution
was done in China and <a lot of people died, more than> 30
<million> people<>. If that were to happen in Cambodia, it meant
I myself would be <killed because> I got some education and I
would be smashed because in such a revolution -- that is, the
cultural revolution, the educated ones would be smashed and they
would build a new force. And in fact through my observation,
Angkar appointed people in the way that I <had> understood. That
means the educated people at the village <or> commune were not
appointed to any position. Only the uneducated ones <were
appointed>, some were even illiterate <and> were appointed to be
chief, for instance, group chiefs or chiefs of <communes>. That
was the reason I no longer had confidence in this so-called
Cultural Revolution; <I feared that>. And that's it, Mr.
Prosecutor.
Q. Thank you. So, what did you mean by your reference to the
Cultural Revolution? <What is the exact meaning of it?> Can you
expand on that?
A. <To> my understanding <> once a cultural revolution <was>
initiated, the intellectuals or the educated ones who did not
join the rank or line of the revolution would be smashed and
whoever opposed Angkar would also be smashed. <Those who did not
keep their mouth shut would be smashed.>
Q. Thank you. You also stated that your home village was close to
the village where Ta Mok came from. Can you tell the Court what
was Ta Mok's home village and how far was it from your village?
A. Ta Mok lived in Prakeab village, Trapeang Thum Khang Tboung
commune while I lived in Prey Ta Lei village in Trapeang Thum
Khang Cheung commune. It means we were living in an adjacent
commune or village.
Q. When was the first time you met Ta Mok and did you know his
family <well>?
A. I met him in 1975 -- right in 1975, when he was walking to the
market. As for his family, his wife was Khoeum and I knew her
well. As we were not living far from one another, his house was
<less than> one kilometre from my house.
Q. Did you have any special relationship with his wife before you
met him?
A. No, not at all.
Q. You said that you knew his wife clearly; can you tell the
Court how <> you <got> to know her <that> well?
A. Because she lived in nearby village. However at that time I
did not know what she did and sometimes we went to get some
firewood in the forest and we met <each other>.
Q. Thank you. Let me return to your written record of interview
with the Office of the CIJ
again. In the document E3/5511, at answer 2, you stated the
following, and let me quote: "People said in 1957, or 1958, Khieu
Samphan came to meet Ta Mok." End of quote.
I would like <to> clarify with you whether it was 1957,1958, that
Khieu Samphan came to meet Ta Mok, or 1967 or '68 which is when
Khieu Samphan, Hou Youn and Hu Nim fled Phnom Penh to join the
resistance?
A. I cannot recall the year clearly. However at that time people
throughout the village, <Prakeab village> and the adjacent
village knew that Khieu Samphan and Ta Mok met <each> other.
Though I did not know where they met.
Q. <Thank you, Mr. Witness.> Who exactly told you that Khieu
Samphan had come to meet Ta Mok?
A. I cannot tell you exactly but everybody at that time said the
same thing and I did not know who <exactly he or she was>.
Q. Did you <know as to> why Khieu Samphan came to meet Ta Mok at
that time?
A. No, not at that time. Neither the villagers nor I knew the
reason for the meeting. I did not know which position Ta Mok held
or which position Khieu Samphan held at that time <because it was
just the beginning>.
Q. <Thank you, Mr. Witness.> Did you personally ever see Khieu
Samphan in Tram Kak district or in Takeo province and if so,
when<>?
A. To my knowledge I <saw> him once. However, I did not meet him
face to face, at that time I was  building a dam at Khpob Trabek
(phonetic) and Yeay Khoeum -- that is, Ta Mok's wife was carrying
some stuff and I had a bicycle near the dam so I helped her in
carrying <that stuff including> the rice cake, while she still
carried some other <egg> cake <put in a paper box> on her head
and we reached <Chambak Ponnoreay> village which is now called
Stueng<> village. There were plenty of bamboo <forests> there and
when we reached that location, she told me to drop off<> the rice
cake and she told me that person was <Mr.> Khieu Samphan. I had a
quick look at him and <>that was the only encounter I had with
Khieu Samphan. <I never saw him before> and <Yeay Khoeum,> Ta
Mok's wife told me so.
Q. Thank you. Let me move to another subject that is in relation
to cooperatives. In your OCIJ interview -- that is, document
E3/5511, at answer number 3, you stated the following and let me
quote: "After 1975, the cooperative was formed and many people
died at that time." And below that, a little bit further you
said, "We did not have enough food to eat and enough clothes to
wear." Can you tell the Court <as to> when <cooperatives were
organized> in your commune -- that is, in Trapeang Thum <Khang>
Cheung <commune>?
A. I forget the date. However, <once> cooperatives were
established<,> it was the time that our <belongings,> cooking
utilities, our rice <stock> were <confiscated> for common use at
the cooperatives.
Q. Were the cooperatives immediately formed after the country
fell in 1975 -- in April 1975, or was it formed in late 1975?
A. Cooperatives were established towards the end of 1975 and as
for District 105 in my commune the <first> cooperative was <>
formed and then after that other cooperatives were established in
other communes within District 105.
Q. <Thank you, Mr. Witness.> Why did you say that many people
died after the cooperatives <had been> formed?
A. After the cooperatives were established, people kept
disappearing. At night time<> there were people who would come to
call those people to go and they disappeared, including my uncle.
My uncle complained <a lot> about the cooperative and one night
he disappeared and he never returned.
Q. Thank you for your response in relation to your uncle and I
will have more questions on the issue of your uncle later on. How
did the implementation of cooperatives affect the supply of food
that was available for people to eat?
A. Initially when the cooperative was established, I was happy as
we would have a common meal so for those who lacked food would be
able to eat <with those who were rich. That was easy>. However,
later on, let me give you an example, in my family, we grew
<cucumber on> two plots of land <for one family> and <in the
cooperative,> for the entire village, they could only plant <crop
or vegetable> for only <two or> three plot of lands. So <it> was
not sufficient for the people in the cooperative and then<>
people started to complain <throughout the cooperative. At first,
people were not really afraid, so many of them both young and old
complained. It made> the cooperative <>not that good for the
people.
Q. <Thank you, Mr. Witness.> In regards to the lack of sufficient
food, you also made the following statement in answer 3 of your
interview with OCIJ -- that is, the same document, E3/5511, and
let me quote: "If someone complained about the lack of food and
the complaint was overheard, they were invited to go out at night
time and never returned." Do you remember any people who
disappeared after complaining about the lack of food in the
cooperatives?
A. Most of the people they complained but they did not do it
publicly not like in the case of my uncle who did it openly, he
stated that the cooperative was not good and then he disappeared.
Q. Thank you. Mr. President, for my next line of questions I
would like to seek your leave to provide a document to the
witness. The document is E3/4108, which is a report from Khpob
Trabek commune. I seek your leave, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed.
BY MR. SENG LEANG:
Q. Mr. Witness, the document that you have in your hand is a
report from Khpob Trabek commune, dated 8 May 1977, and it was
signed by a cadre named Cham. It identified two former Lon Nol
soldiers a corporal and a captain who had criticised the
revolution and complained about the lack of food. One was
reported as saying, let me quote: "What is the use of doing
socialist revolution when there is no food?" End of quote. And
the other had complained that, "<In Trapeang Thum Khang Cheung
commune, pigs were slaughtered and pork was given to people to
eat at will, and> there is plenty of food in the warehouse.
<After they got up, they had food to eat and could go for a walk.
However,> for us <we worked so hard and almost died but> we
<still> did not have anything to eat."
And my question to you is the following, did you know a Khmer
Rouge leader from Khpob Trabek commune named Cham<? And how> was
Cham related to Ta Mok?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. Yes, I knew Ta Cham. Ta Cham was chief of Khpob Trabek commune
and he was <a>younger blood brother of Ta Mok.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. Now, going back to again to answer 3
of your interview under, E3/5511, you stated that, and I quote:
"My uncle Long Neak was accused of betraying Angkar. He was
called out and disappeared." Mr. Witness, could you elaborate <as
to> why he was arrested?
A. When he was arrested, as I told you earlier, he complained
about the cooperative and he said that in the future it <would>
become communist -- a real communist and he <would> not <be>
willing to be a part of it.
Q. Thank you. Did you know who came and called him out and who
ordered that person to call him out<?>
A. No, I didn't know about that because I was far away from him
and it happened at night. I've asked his wife and children but
they <did not know. They just knew that there were people> who
came to call him out <but they did not know who they were>
because it happened at night.
Q. Since he was called out until the present time have you ever
met him again?
A. Since he was called out, he disappeared <until now> and I have
never met him. We celebrated a ritual ceremony for him a few
times already.
Q. <Thank you.> Mr. Witness, can you <describe> for the Court,
before and during the DK regime, what <your uncle> was <> doing
for a living<>?
A. Before the DK regime, my uncle was a farmer, a rice farmer and
he <also worked on> plantation to earn his living. <He was always
a farmer.>
Q. Could you indicate or elaborate a bit further what he did
during DK regime<? Or> was he just a simple villager?
A. He was a simple villager.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. Now I would like to come <to the time
period between> 1975 <and> 1976 when you were assigned as a staff
at Tram Kak hospital. You said the following in answer number 4
of your interview <with OCIJ> under, E3/5511, and I quote: "I
<was not allowed to> live together with my family, I was sent to
work in a craft unit. My children were sent to other places to
<herd> cattle. While my wife lived in the cooperative, I could
ask for leave to see my wife <and my children> but it could not
be done often. Some people asked for leave to visit their family
but leave was refused. If they secretly visited their family and
the visits were discovered, they <would disappear>." End of
quote.
My question <to> you is as the following; when was it, in
relation to 17 April 1975, that your family <members were>
separated and you were no longer allowed to live with your wife
and your children?
A. My family members were separated since the creation of the
cooperative and we've always been separated since then.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. In relation to this, was there any
cadre in your commune or your district who explained <as to> why
Angkar would not allow people to live freely with your family,
your children or <home> visit at your freedom<? Was> there any
explanation or announcement like this?
A. No. No one <> ever explained to me about this.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness, and talking about freedom of meeting
or visiting your family members, you said that you <could> ask
for leave to visit your family members but you could not do that
very often and some other people asked for permission to visit
<their family> but his request was refused. If they tried
secretly to visit <their family> and if it was discovered, he or
she <would> disappear. Can you elaborate a bit further on this?
A. I heard this from the unit chief saying that if anyone who
went to visit family members without any permission <or
permission was rejected>, he or she <would> be in trouble and the
person may disappear.
Q. Who was your unit chief?
A. My unit chief was Mon, he is dead now.
Q. Was he the one who <issued the> order? Was it in general in
your cooperative <in which they were very strict on giving
permission to visit family members>?
A. In fact, I don't know for sure but at the <livelihood>
meetings he announced the same as I have just told you a while
ago.
Q. Now talking about your wife, she was assigned to a different
cooperative, which cooperative was she sent to?
A. She was assigned and sent to a cooperative in Ta Suon village
in the same Trapeang Thum <Khang> Cheung <commune>.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. At each time when you met with your
wife, did she tell you anything about the living condition and
food ration at her cooperative?
A. Yes, she did. <In> her cooperative, she was assigned to do the
cooking at the kitchen and there was very limited food and
vegetables <were little> and <it was difficult and she>
complained about food ration.
Q. Did she tell you that the villagers in her cooperative have
enough to eat?
A. She told me that people did not have enough to eat, people
would eat rice gruel and the soup was very little for everyone.
Everyone would receive only a small bowl of soup per meal.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. Did she tell you any difficulty <of
work> at her cooperative?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Hold on, Witness.
A. She told me that it was very difficult at her cooperative but
all she <needed> to do was to try to live better than to die.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. Now, I would like to move on to
another topic. This is about the treatment of Buddhists. In your
OCIJ interview under document, E319.1.21, at <answers> 45 to 48,
you described<> the beginning of the Khmer Rouge, you witnessed
about 100 monks who were defrocked at<> Angk Roka pagoda. First,
can you tell us where Angk Roka pagoda was located in relation to
your home village?
A. Angk Roka pagoda was about two kilometres away from my village
and I would take a road from Angk Ta Saom to Angk Roka <market>
and the distance was probably eight <or nearly nine> kilometres
away.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. After 17 April 1975, how often did you
go to or <go near> the Angk Roka Pagoda?
A. No. I didn't go there very often.
Q. Thank you, Witness. Can you please tell the Court what you
witnessed at the pagoda in terms of the defrocking of 100 monks
at Angk Roka pagoda?
A. On that day, I saw a jeep car transporting black uniforms and
entering into the Pagoda. There were <more than> 100 monks<>
there and I took food and alms to offer to the monks. <I saw a
jeep car> but there were a few people, a few villagers who
offered meals and alms to the monks. <The alms were not enough,
so more rice was cooked for the monks in the pagoda>. And then <I
saw> the <jeep> car arrived with a load of black uniforms and the
uniforms were unloaded from the car and they started defrocking
the monks <on that day>.
Q. On that day, were all the 100 monks defrocked?
A. No, I didn't witness the defrocking because I left the pagoda
but later the former monks who were from the vicinity or nearby
village were all wearing black uniform.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. You also stated in answer 49 of that
same OCIJ interview that, and I quote: "I saw the Khmer Rouge
demolishing the sculptures and temples and they removed the
smaller Buddhist statues from the pagoda and <threw> them into
the water and buried them." End of quote.
My question is as follows; who were the Khmer Rouge cadres who
you saw demolishing or throwing away Buddhist sculptures and
statues?
A. I don't know those Khmer Rouge cadres but there were about 10
or 20 people. Some of them demolished the sculpture in the
temple, others would remove <small> Buddha <statues> and throw
them into the water <while some others dug a pit in front of the
monk house and threw> the small Buddha shrine <into the pit> and
they buried them in the ground and then I heard the monks were
defrocked.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. In your answer 50 of the same OCIJ
interview under, E319.1.21, you testified as follows, and I
quote: "Ta Ich, who was the head of the monks at the pagoda,
protested against the Khmer Rouge orders. He beat the drum to
call the people to protest against the Khmer Rouge but no one
dared come. The Khmer Rouge clique only beat him two or three
times with a club." End of quote.
My question <to> you is as follows; did you personally witness
the head monk of Angk Roka pagoda be beaten with a club by the
Khmer Rouge forces or is this something you were told <of>?
A. Talking about the beating of the head of the monks, I didn't
witness it <personally> but I heard from other people and later
he was defrocked. He was beaten for beating the drum to call
people to protest against the Khmer Rouge.
Q. Could you tell the Court <as to> who told you about this
incident?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness; please hold on until the microphone is activated.
MR. RIEL SON:
A. No, I don't know, I don't remember the person who told me this
story.
BY MR. SENG LEANG:
Q. Based on what you have just told the Court, on the date that
the head of monk was beaten and the defrocking <> happened on the
same day or different days.
A. Those incidents happened on the same day.
Q. <Did the beating happen before, after or> at the same time
<of> the defrocking<?>
A. It happened at the same time when the monks were <being>
defrocked.
Q. How long have you known Ta Ich? Have you ever been to Angk
Roka pagoda for praying?
A. I know him for long time and I went to that pagoda very often
to celebrate <religious> ceremonies over there.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. Now I would like to move <on to>
another topic. In particular your role as the deputy chief of
Tram Kak District hospital and I want to now turn to the period
you worked at <a> hospital in Tram Kak District.
In answer 14 in your OCIJ interview, under E3/5511, you said that
"you were assigned to be a deputy chief of the hospital in 1976
by Ta Chim and Ta Kit". End of quote.
My question <to> you is as follows; who were Ta Chim and Ta Kit?
A. Ta Chim and Ta Kit were <on> the district <105> committee,
both of them <were> siblings.
Q. Was the hospital at which you were assigned to work, the
district hospital for Tram Kak district?
A. Yes, it was the hospital for District 105 also known as Tram
Kak district.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. Do you know <as to> why Ta Chim and Ta
Kit assigned you to work at this hospital?
A. They assigned to me work at this hospital because I knew how
to <administer> injection and how to give prescription for people
to use medicine <such as for cold and chill>. That's why I was
assigned <to work there>.
Q. In your OCIJ interview, E3/5511, at answer 14, and I quote you
said: "I was sent to work in the hospital by Ta Kit and Ta Chim
because I was able to provide some treatment to my family
<members>." Is this your correct statement to the OCIJ?
A. Yes, this is correct.
Q. Thank you, Witness. Had you ever <received> any medical
training before 1976, before you were assigned as a deputy chief
for that hospital?
A. No. I didn't receive any training.
Q. Thank you, Witness, but now I would like you to <indicate the
location of> the hospital. Where <was> it <>located<? In> what
village, commune<? Was> the hospital located near a pagoda called
Wat Trapeang Kol<>?
A. The District 105 hospital located at<> Trapeang Kol <pagoda.>
It was in Trapeang Svay village, <>Trapeang Thum Cheung commune.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Witness. Was the Tram Kak district hospital
also known as Hospital 22 or M-22? <Was it the same or different
hospitals?>
A. The hospital of District 105 and Hospital 22 were two
different hospitals. Hospital 22 was for the zone army hospital.
Q. Can you tell the Court <as to> how many staff <members> there
<were> at your hospital?
A. There were more than 90 <> male and female <members>,
including those who were doing the cooking and transporting
<cooking wood>.
Q. You were the deputy chief of that hospital and who was the
chief <of the hospital>?
A. <There were several chiefs> of District 105 hospital, <most of
them were female.> The first chief was female, Met and then
female, Ya then female, Neang was the last chief and we had three
chiefs in a row.
Q. Do you have any idea why only women were assigned as the chief
for that hospital?
A. To my understanding the women who were appointed as chiefs of
the hospital <> were Party members. They were all Party members,
the three of them. But let me stress, they did not come at the
same time. <One> came to replace another as one was the chief for
<one, two, three,> four or five months and was replaced.
Q. From what you just stated, only a Party member was appointed
as chief of the hospital, is that correct?
A. Yes. Only a Party member would be appointed as chief of a
hospital.
Q. Did the hospital chief have medical expertise or skills?
A. In fact the three women, who were <my> chief<s>, they did not
have any idea at all about the medicines and as for <female,>
Met<>, she did not even know how to read.
Q. Thank you. I would like to ask you about the hospital at the
sector level -- that is, for Sector 13 and hospital at the zone
level for the Southwest Zone. Were there such hospitals at the
sector and zone levels?
A. There was a sector hospital. It was called Trapeang Roneab and
the zone hospital <> at Angk Ta Saom <was located> at <Sala>
Daeum Chambak.
Q. Thank you. Did any of Ta Mok's children or siblings have
positions <>at the district, sector or zone hospitals? If so,
please provide the details.
A. As for hospitals, at the district, at the sector or at the
zone level, there was a <>younger sister of Ta Mok named Yeay
Koeun, who worked at the zone hospital.
Q. How did you know about that?
A. That hospital was <close to mine, that is> near Angk Ta Saom
market <where> I referred the patients to the hospital<.> I could
refer <patients> either to the Sector hospital or to the zone
hospital <for severe cases for special medical attention.>
Q. Did Ta Mok's younger sister have medical expertise or received
any medical training?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please observe the microphone.
MR. RIEL SON:
A. To my knowledge she was not that skilful in the medical field
but there were people dealing with the technical issues in that
hospital.
BY MR. SENG LEANG:
Q. Thank you. Let me go back to your OCIJ interview -- that is,
document E3/5511, in answer 14, you described receiving some
training after you were appointed to work at the hospital in 1976
and you also stated that your first training lasted three months
and that you trained at the sector or zone hospital by a
<trainer> named Sei, and that you were trained with human
anatomy. Can you tell us what months in 1976; you had these three
months of training?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, please wait. And Counsel Koppe, you have the floor.
MR. VICTOR KOPPE:
Thank you, Mr. President. I think in this particular case, the
Prosecution should be including the second part of the sentence
which says there is a six months of training. It is within the
same sentence. First training lasted three months and the second
one lasted six months so I don't see why we are limiting
ourselves to this three months training.
MR. SENG LEANG:
Mr. President, allow me to respond. I have some more questions on
the issue of the six month training. Let me now focus on the
three months of training and after that I will move on to the six
months of training.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please respond to the last question put by the <>
National <Deputy> Co-Prosecutor, if you can recall it. If not,
<>the question to be put again to you.
BY MR. SENG LEANG:
Q. My question to you is the following: In what months in 1976,
did you receive <the three-month> training?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. I cannot recall the month or the year of that <three-month>
training. However, I can recall that that was the first <>medical
training and it lasted for three months.
Q. Can you recall when you concluded that training, in what
month?
A. No, I cannot recall it. In fact the three month training was
not consecutive. It was on and off and if you count the actual
days of training, it was roughly around two weeks <or probably 20
days> only. <And then it stopped.>
Q. And then can you tell the Court, when <> you <started> working
at that district hospital?
A. I cannot recall the <day>. However, it was late 1976, I mean
almost the beginning of 1977.
Q. I also have another question on this training. You stated that
you were trained with human anatomy. What do you mean by that?
A. As for the training with human anatomy, we would study the
skeletons of a human body, we would study the internal organs
including the liver, <gallbladder> and other organs. So in short
we studied everything about human anatomy, inside and outside.
Q. You also stated that you later had additional training that
lasted as much as six months. When and where did that second
training session take place?
A. For the second training session, it was held at the sector
hospital. <Now it is> at Trapeang Roneab.
Q. When did you receive that training?
A. It was <in the year of 1976 and 1977,> in late<> 1977.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is now convenient to take a short break. We will take a break
now and return at 10.30. <Please be back in the courtroom.>
And Court officer, please assist the witness <at the waiting room
for witnesses and civil parties> during the break and have him
return with his duty counsel to the courtroom at 10.30.
The Court is now in recess.
(Court recesses from 1011H to 1032H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Court is now back in session.
And the floor is now given to the <Co-Prosecutors> to continue
<their> line of questioning for this witness.
BY MR. SENG LEANG:
Thank you, Mr. President.
Q. Now I would like to move on to another question. In answer
number 8 of your OCIJ interview, under E3/5511, you made the
following statement and I quote:
"Many people fell sick thanks to overwork and lack of food to
eat. People who were sick and could not go to work were sent to
be treated in the hospital. In the hospital, people were
appropriately treated but there were not enough medicines". End
of quote.
My question for you is that I would like you to indicate, in
general what <>the most common <diseases were that patients at>
the Tram Kak district hospital <were suffering from>?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. <For those> patients who were sent to my hospital, <most of
them> were suffering from diarrhoea, swollen body, and also
malaria.
Q. Can you tell the Court what <medicines that were> in desperate
need for your hospital at the time?
A. At my hospital at the time, we were lacking of every medicine.
<There were some medicines but they were not enough>.
Q. And you said many patients were suffering from diarrhoea, <the
swelling nature of the illness >, and did you think at the time
that those medicines were sufficient for that treatment purpose?
A. No, they were not sufficient for our treatment purpose at the
time.
Q. Now, I would like to move on to another -- answer 147 of your
interview with the OCIJ, under E319.1.21. You were asked how many
patients your hospital admitted each day, and you provided the
following response and I quote: "We received about <more than 30>
men each day. But some of them died because<> their condition
were too serious. There were more than 100 women each day". End
of quote.
And my question is as follows. Was there <any> reason that the
number of female patients at your hospital was much higher than
the number of male patients? Why <were there> so many <female
patients> in Tram Kak hospital?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, please hold on. Now, Mr. Victor Koppe, you may proceed.
MR. KOPPE:
No objection, Mr President, but I have something different in my
English version of the interview. It says 30 and not 10. But
maybe something went wrong with the translation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, please respond to the question posed by the
Co-Prosecutor.
MR. RIEL SON:
Could you please repeat your question?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please hold on. There's a technical problem with the transcripts
machine.
Court officer, please coordinate with the staff so that we can
have the problem fixed for a proper operation.
(Short pause)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Co-Prosecutor and Witness. Prosecutor, could you please
repeat your question to the witness so that he can reply.
BY MR. SENG LEANG:
My question <to> you is as follows: Why were there more female
patients than the male <patients> at Tram Kak hospital?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. There were more female patients at the District 105 hospital
because women were weaker than men and they <did not have enough
food and> were exposed to hard labour. <Since they overworked,>
many women <fell> sick and <many> were sent to the hospital
<every day>.
Q. I have another question before I conclude my line of
questioning for you. You also stated <in your answer 147> that
some of <the> patients who were sent to your hospital <and> died,
and I quote: "because their conditions were too serious". Can you
explain what do you mean by this -- that is, what were the
condition of people who died?
A. Those patients <had fallen sick at the worksite, and their
condition already became worse by the time they arrived at the>
commune <hospital. And so some of them died along the way during
the transfer from the commune hospital to my hospital,> and
<sometimes> when they arrived at my hospital, <they died
instantly, and corpses were sent back>.
MR. SENG LEANG:
Thank you, Mr. Witness for responding to my questions. And Mr.
President, I have no further questions to put to this witness and
my esteemed colleague will continue his line of questioning for
this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, <> International <Deputy> Co-Prosecutor, you may proceed.
QUESTIONING BY MR. LYSAK:
Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, Mr. Witness. My name is
Dale Lysak and I'll be asking you some questions this morning and
this afternoon. I want to start by asking you about how the
district hospital reported to the leaders of Tram Kak district.
Can you tell us how the hospital reported to the Tram Kak
district committee, and specifically, whether you sent written
reports or whether your reporting was done verbally in person?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. The way we did reporting from our District 105 hospital, we
did not prepare a written report for the district committee, but
we would appear before the district chief to make oral report.
Because we thought that it <was> not helpful to prepare a written
report, because <when there were a lot of patients,> there was
<still> no medicine, <and when the patients had no food to eat,
we did not see any food or rice supply coming. That made no
difference,> so we kept doing oral report as usual and <we were
fine and> there was no problem with that oral report.
Q. Thank you. How often did you attend meetings to report to the
district chief?
A. <I went to make oral report to district committee. Sometimes,>
I would go to the district office <>alone at the end of each
month, <or> at any time before the end of the month, <as long as>
I <could> see him to make oral report. <I could only make> oral
report but I received no <benefit in return>.
Q. And can you tell us where it was that you would meet with the
district chief and who else would be present at those meetings?
A. I would meet <>with the district chief at the district office.
Q. Could you tell us where the district office was located?
A. The district office was located at Angk Roka market. It was at
a <>house belonging to the former Chinese owner <in the market.
Apart from this, there were no people living there and> the
market was empty. <And the houses were empty>.
Q.You stated that, a couple of minutes ago, that you went to
report to the district chief by yourself. Is there a reason that
the chiefs of the hospital, the three women who you identified
earlier, is there a reason that that person didn't come to the
meetings?
A. Talking about reporting, <for> reporting of the patients, I
did oral report for that. But reporting about the Party's
activity or work, the three chiefs would go to the district chief
to make report.
Q. In your OCIJ interview, E3/5511, and perhaps before I get to
that, Mr. President, maybe at this time I will ask to provide to
the witness and his counsel his two OCIJ interviews, E3/5511 and
E319.1.21. And also I request to provide him his two DC-Cam
interviews as I may ask him questions from those. The two DC-Cam
interviews are, for the record, .409 and .410.
And with your leave, Mr. President, can I provide those four
statements to the witness?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Co-Prosecutor, your request is granted.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Now, Mr. Witness, I have provided these to you and your counsel
so you have them in case you wish to refer. I'm going to refer
now to answer 15 in your first OCIJ interview, E3/5511. In that
answer, you described a quarterly meeting at which you were asked
by the district committee, why people from the hospital suffered
from diarrhoea and puffiness or swelling. Can you tell the Court
what you told the district committee when they asked you why
there people in the hospital who were sick with diarrhoea and
swelling?
MR. SON RIEL:
A. When I reported to him that people suffered from swelling and
diarrhoea because the lack of nutrition for their health <and
there was not enough food>, that was the reason <> they had this
kind of illness.
Q. And, you said him. Were -- at this meeting, were you reporting
to the entire district committee or was it just the district
chief?
A. I reported to only the district chief.
Q. And what was the district chief's response when you told him
that people were sick because they didn't have enough food to eat
and were suffering from malnutrition?
A. The district secretary responded to me that I was attacking
<or insulting> the cooperative by my report, by my words.
Q. And did you ask the district chief to provide more food to the
hospital? And if so, what was his response?
A. At the time, I dared not request anything because I <did
request quite often> but I received nothing in return.
Q. In the next answer -- question and answer in that same
statement E35511, answer 16, you described the ration of rice
that was given to the district -- given by the district to your
hospital as follows. Quote: "I was allowed to have 50 cans of
rice for 250 patients. Four cans of rice were equivalent to one
kilogram". Can you tell us, was that a daily ration? What was the
period for which you would receive 50 cans of rice for 250
patients?
A. This is a daily ration.
Q. And did the rations remain the same throughout the entire
period that you worked at the district hospital?
A. I didn't know what happened in other places but <I talked
about only what> happened at my place.
Q. Do you remember the year this meeting took place? Or do you
remember who the district chief was at the time of this incident
where you reported that there was malnutrition and you were
accused of attacking the cooperatives?
A. I forget the date and year. But at the time, the district
<chiefs were> Ta Chay, Ta Chim. And in particular, Ta Chay
<accused> me of attacking <>the cooperative; <the cooperative was
created, but I in turn attacked the cooperative>.
Q. While we're talking about the district chiefs, I want to see
if I can go through with you the succession of people who were
the district chief of Tram Kak during the Khmer Rouge regime. In
your interview E319.1.21, at answer 213, you identified a woman
named Khom, who was the daughter of Ta Mok and the wife of Meas
Muth, and stated that she was the District 105 secretary early in
the regime but that, in your words, she went insane. Can you
describe for the Court what Yeay Khom was like as the district
chief and what happened to her?
A. At the time, Yeay Khom was the district secretary but later,
she became insane. She kept saying words. Sometimes when I met
her, she ordered me to cut the big tree and to dig the ground to
pull out the stump of the <mango> tree, <I was afraid, so I
always followed her order,> but actually she was insane.
Q. And do you know what happened to her after she became insane?
A. After the incident that she became insane, I don't know what
happened to her because <she> left the area for Kampong Saom.
Q. In answer 13 of interview, E3/5511, you identified the
following people as being district committee - District 105
committee. Quote: "Ta Chay, Ta Kit, Ta Chim, and Ta San", and you
noted that Ta Kit and Ta Chim were biological siblings. And in
your DC-Cam interview, .409, at English ERN, 00729041;
Khmer, 00418824; and French, 00808621; you stated, quote:
"Question: What was the name of the district's chief?"
"Answer: It was Ta Kit who predecessor was Ta Chim. Ta Kit was
followed by Ta San, younger brother-in-law of Ta Mok". End of
quote.
Do I understand correctly that Ta Chim was the district chief
after Yeay Khom?
A. In fact, Ta Chim was the chief of Tram Kak <district> before
Yeay Khom. And when Ta Chim was sent to the rubber plantation and
then Yeay Khom was assigned to replace him.
Q. All right. I'll come back to that in a little while. After Ta
Chim and Yeay Khom, can you tell us your recollection of who the
district chiefs were?
A. Before the end of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ta San, the
<younger> brother-in-law of Ta Mok who was the district chief.
<He was the last district chief.>
Q. And you've indicated that Ta Chay was district chief for a
period. Can you tell us when he was district chief? Or who it was
that -- where he fell in the succession of district chiefs -- who
he was district chief after and before?
A. After Ta Chay, there were two cadres, Ta Kit and Ta Chim. And
later, Yeay Khom and after that, Ta San, who was the <younger>
brother-in-law of Ta Mok.
Q. Mr. Witness, I'm going to try to refresh your recollection
about the timing of -- that Chim and Kit were district chiefs. In
interview E319, I'm sorry, interview -- OCIJ interview E3/400, at
pages Khmer, 00373459; English, 00379171; French, 00426179. And
this was an interview of former district chief, Chim. He
testified that he left Tram Kak to go to Kampong Cham, to the
rubber plantation, in February 1977, and that he was replaced as
district secretary by his brother Kit. Does that refresh your
recollection that Chim was district secretary after Yeay Khom,
and that Chim was then succeeded by his brother Kit?
A. No, I could not remember.
Q. Was Kit someone that you knew fairly well?
A. I knew Ta Kit really well.
Q. Let me ask you before I -- let me ask you about another --
some other people that you referenced in your various interviews.
In a DC-Cam interview, .409, and here I'm referring to
Khmer, 00418876; English, 00729094; and French, 00808678. You
referred to a cadre named Ta Keav, who had been arrested. Can you
tell us what was Ta Keav's position in Tram Kak district?
A. From the beginning, Ta Keav was the secretary of Tram Kak
district. However, I only saw him <probably> for a few months
<but I cannot remember exactly. Maybe, it was the end of his
term> and then he disappeared and I did not know where he went.
Q. You said that he was arrested. How did you become aware that
Ta Keav had been arrested?
A. I only knew that <when> he left. <At that time,> Ta Kit was
ill and he rested at the house, and I was there as well. <I saw
Ta Keav was riding on a small bicycle and he told Ta Kit.> And at
that time, there was only him, Ta Kit, and myself <who stayed at
a villager's house>. And he told Ta Kit that he would go away
<and he did not know where he would go; probably he would
disappear>. And from that day onward, he disappeared.
Q. Another person -- two people actually, that I'd like to ask
you about. In answer 13 of your OCIJ statement, E3/5511, you
identified a person named Dan, who held the position of chief or
head of the district office. And in your DC-Cam interview
.409, Khmer, 00418877; English, 00729095 through 96;
French, 00808679; you identified a man named Phy, someone who had
a broken leg and who had preceded Dan as head of the district
office. Can you explain -- my question is, can you explain what
Phy and Dan's roles or responsibilities were as chief of the
district office and how their function differed from the people
who were district secretary?
A. Phy and Dan were <chiefs> of the district office, and their
main responsibility was to receive goods or materials sent from
the upper level -- that is, from the sector level. And those
materials included medicine. And in fact, the district office was
a kind of a commerce office. It means that was the location where
they received supplies or materials from the sector, and then
they would make the arrangement for the distribution to the
<communes>.
Q. You said in that same part of your DC-Cam interview that Phy
was a cruel person. What did you mean by that? Why did you say
that?
A. I said that Phy was a cruel person. And although I was much
older than him and he was much younger and had a broken leg, but
would threaten me <like I was a kid>. He's really, really very
cruel, but he passed away.
Q. In another part of the same DC-Cam interview, D3131.2.409,
Khmer, 00418815; English, 00729031; French, 00808611; you
provided the following statement about another occasion where you
had tried to discuss the possibility of increasing production of
medicine. And this is what you said in that interview, I quote:
"I also wanted to make more productions but I needed more raw
materials. When I raised this issue, they said it would be
impossible. Raising this issue, I had my conscience assessed. I
was assessed as having the imagination of a bourgeois and an
intellectual rather than a worker." End of quote. Who was it that
criticised you as being a bourgeois and intellectual, when you
raised the idea of trying to produce more medicine?
A. At that time, it was the district secretary, that is, Ta Chay
who said that I was a bourgeoisie and intellectual.
Q. Was this the same meeting where you were accused of attacking
the cooperatives for saying people had malnutrition or was this a
different meeting?
A. <They were> two separate matters.
Q. And in that same DC-Cam interview at Khmer, 00418817; English,
00729033; French, 00808613; you made -- you gave the following
testimony or statement:
"Question: Did patients die at that centre?"
"Answer: First, only a few died occasionally. But later, the
death toll increased dramatically due to dysentery and
malnutrition."
And continuing below; "Generally speaking, malnutrition and
dysentery led to five deaths per day in the last period." End of
quote.
Can you tell us why the number of deaths from malnutrition
increased dramatically in the latter part of the Khmer Rouge
regime?
A. Toward the latter part of the regime, it became worse. People
did not have anything to eat. For that reason, <swollen body and
dysentery increased in a large number>.
Q. And I know you weren't trained as a -- as a medical doctor but
you received medical training and you worked at the hospital
where these patients died. Can you explain to the Court how it is
that people died from malnutrition in your hospital?
A. I said they died from malnutrition because in general, we need
to have all kinds of nutrition for our body. And with the lack of
nutrition, people got dysentery <and swollen body>, but the main
concern was that their bodies became swollen <and water kept
coming out of their whole body>. And that caused by the lack of
food and malnutrition.
Q. Were the majority of people who died from malnutrition 17
April People or Base People?
A. Both groups. The Base People also died as well as the New
People.
Q. And after you were criticised by the district chief for
attacking the cooperatives and for being a bourgeois and
intellectual, did you ever raise again with the leaders of Tram
Kak district the problem of malnutrition and insufficient
medicine in the district?
A. No, I did not. I dared not do that again. I was very afraid by
that time.
Q. I'd like now to turn to a different subject, the subject of
purges of enemies. In both of your OCIJ interviews, you described
being present at a Tram Kak district meeting at which
instructions were given on the categories or groups of people to
be purged. Specifically in interview, E319.1.21, at answers 40
through 43, you described how the district committee instructed
that the following people were to be purged, and I quote:
"Former government workers with the rank of first assistant to
the chief of commune and above were to be arrested and sent to be
executed. Former government police and military officials with
the rank of warrant officer and above were also to be arrested
and killed."
Continuing in the next question and answer:
"Question: Apart from the above categories, were there any other
groups also to be purged?"
"Answer: Yes, any of the people who went round speaking against
the Khmer Rouge had to be reported and taken away to be killed."
"Question: Among the people considered Khmer Rouge opponents,
were they also classified as feudalist, Chinese, CIA, KGB, Khmer
Krom, Cham or Buddhist followers?"
"Answer: I did hear that people from Kampuchea Krom had been
accused of being KGB agents, "Yuon" spies. At those meetings, it
was brought up that all the Khmer Krom had to be killed." End of
quote.
The first thing I'd like to clarify with you, Mr. Witness, is
whether there was only one meeting at which these instructions
were provided or were there multiple meetings where these issues
were discussed?
A. On the issue of the purges, I only knew about this instruction
only at that particular meeting that I attended. <For other
meetings, I did not know because I did not attend those
meetings.>
Q. And where did that meeting take place?
A. The meeting was held at a kitchen hall near Angk Roka market.
<Nowadays that compound of the kitchen hall has been turned into
a high school. The meeting> was held right there in the kitchen
hall.
Q. How many district cadres were present at this meeting, and
specifically were the commune chiefs in attendance?
A. I cannot recall the total number. However, there were
representatives from the nearby communes attending the meeting.
There were many people who were evacuated from Phnom Penh and
from Takeo. So the representatives from the communes attended the
meeting including the Trapeang Thum Khang Cheung commune,
<Trapeang Thum Khang Tboung commune, and Cheang Tong commune. I
could only remember two or three communes but I did not know who
came to attend the meeting.>
Q. In your first OCIJ interview, E3/5511, at answer nine, you
stated and I quote: "The chiefs of the district, the communes,
the villages, and unit members were invited to attend a
conference. The conference participants were informed of what
categories of people to be purged."
Continuing below: "The conference was attended by the district
committee. There was a planned purge. People who were targeted to
be purged included; soldiers, from the ranks of corporal,
sergeant and above in the army, and from the first deputy chief
and above in the administration." Now, one thing I just want to
clarify, to be sure about, in the other OCIJ interview I read,
the former military to be purged were described as those with the
rank of warrant officer and above instead of corporal sergeant
and above. However, when I looked at the French translation, the
military rank was described the same in both interviews, that of
adjutant. And your DC-Cam interview also stated that the rank to
be killed was anyone with the rank of warrant officer and above.
At -- who you referred to as commissioned officers, and this was
referenced at .409, Khmer, 00418851; English, 00729068;
French, 00808649. And what I wanted to ask you was just to
explain what you meant by commissioned officers, and to have in
your words in Khmer the rank that the district committee
instructed were to be purged.
A. At the meeting, he told us about the purges of all those
people. And <for> those who were in the army, they had to be
purged from the adjutant up. And as for the administration side,
it means from the first deputy chief and up or above.
Q. And who was the district representative who provided these
instructions at this meeting?
A. There was Ta Chay. However, there were a few other commune
chiefs who attended that meeting. <But Ta Chay was the only one.>
Q. You have testified that there were commune chiefs present at
the meeting -- at this meeting where the district committee gave
instructions on the former Lon Nol soldiers and officials to be
purged. There are a number of reports from communes relating to
the arrests of former ranking officers or officials. I'd like to
now show you a few of those reports. Mr. President, with your
leave, I'd like to provide these documents together to the
witness. They are; E3/2048; E3/2435; E3/4103; and E3/2917. With
your leave, I'll provide them to the witness together and then I
will go through the documents. And also I would like to show them
on the screen as we question the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed.
(Short pause)
BY MR. LYSAK:
Mr. Witness, I've handed you a number of documents. I'm going to
take you through them one by one. The first is, E3/2048, and it's
Khmer page, 00079089; English, 00276562 through 63; and French,
00611659. This is the report to Tram Kak district, Angkar from
Cheang Tong commune, signed by someone named Moeun, dated the
30th of April 1977, and it includes the following statement,
quote: "After having received successive instructions from Angkar
about being vigilant about the enemy and purging the enemy
officers, we have tracked, examined, and found the following
persons." End of quote.
Do you remember a cadre from Cheang Tong commune named Moeun?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. No, the name was not Moeun. In fact, it was Boeun. <And Boeun
was a lady.>
Q. The next report in the collection I gave you is also E3/2048,
at Khmer, 00079091; English, 00276564; and French, 00611661. And
it is a report from Ta Phem commune, signed by someone named Kit,
that was sent almost at the same time as the last document, on
the 28th of April 1977. And it reports that the commune had, and
I quote: "Examined and purged the enemies who held ranks after
having received the instructions of the Party." End of quote.
My question for you about this document, was there another cadre
in the district named Kit who was a representative of Ta Phem
commune, a different person than the Kit who was the district
chief?
A. No, I do not know a person at the commune by the name of Kit.
Q. The next document is E3/2435, and it is a report from Angk Ta
Saom commune to district Angkar, dated the 26th of April 1977,
which confirmed that, and I quote: "For those who have ranks as
first lieutenant or second lieutenant, I am going to contact with
Comrade Yorn, district military in order to take them out this
evening right away." And this note, I believe, appears on the
second page of the report. My question, do you -- did you know a
cadre form the district military named Comrade Yorn?
A. No, I did not know a person at that time by that name, Yorn.
Q. And then I have two documents from Popel commune. First,
E3/4103, at Khmer, 00143476; and this is on the right side of
that page, English, 00322133; French, 00612838. And this is the
document dated the 11th of April, from a cadre from Popel commune
named Chorn who reported to the district. Quote: "For those
people who held a ranking position, we will send them to you one
after another." End of quote.
And one month later, in early May 1977, in the next document,
E3/2917, the same commune reported to the district that: "106
military families, 393 people had already been smashed by Angkar
or died and the commune was screening more families to find out
whether or not they are of the military personnel." End of quote.
First, do you remember a cadre from Popel commune named Chorn?
A. No. I did not, because Popel commune was far from where I
lived. I <just> knew <the name of the> commune<> but I did not
know who was in charge of that commune.
Q. You've mentioned a woman named Boeun who was chief of Cheang
Tong commune. Did you know Boeun's husband?
A. Chorn was <Yeay> Boeun's husband but I am not sure whether he
is still alive.
Q. Do you remember, was Yeay Boeun present at this meeting where
the district chief announced this plan for purges of Lon Nol
officers?
A. No, she was not there at the meeting.
Q. These documents that I've shown you from four different
communes in Tram Kak district are all from the same time period,
April to early May 1977. Do these documents refresh your
recollection about the timing of the meeting you attended where
instructions were provided on the purge of Lon Nol officers? And
specifically, do you remember when in relation to April 1977 that
meeting took place? Was it before April '77, or was it after
April 1977?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please wait and Counsel Koppe, you have the floor.
MR. KOPPE:
I object to this question. You would look in the dictionary for a
textbook leading question, there we have one. This is not the way
to ask a witness questions by feeding him all kinds of details
around dates and then ask him to confirm. What's the purpose of
this line of questioning?
MR. LYSAK:
If I may respond, Your Honour, the purpose of documents is they
help witnesses remember dates. The question was not leading. I
asked the witness whether the meeting was before or after April
1977. That is not leading question; that is the exact opposite of
a leading question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The objection raised by the Defence Counsel is overruled, as the
Chamber needs to hear the response from the witness to the last
question put to him by the <>Deputy <International>
Co-Prosecutor. And Witness, please respond.
MR. RIEL SON:
Please, put the question again.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Do these documents refresh your recollection on the timing of the
meeting you attended where instructions were provided on the
purge of Lon Nol officers? Do you remember was that meeting
before or after April 1977?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. The meeting was held before 1977.
Q. And one further question, Mr. President, before I change
subjects. Do you remember - was this meeting during the time
period that you were working at the district hospital?
A. The meeting was organised when I was working at the district
hospital.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, <the> International <Deputy> Co-Prosecutor. It is now
appropriate time for lunch break. And the Trial Chamber will take
a break from now until 1.30 this afternoon. <Please be back in
the courtroom.>
Court officer, please coordinate the rest for the witness and his
duty counsel with the WESU, and have both the witness and duty
counsel back in the courtroom at 1.30 this afternoon.
And security personnel are instructed to bring Mr. Khieu Samphan
to the waiting room downstairs and have him back before 1.30 this
afternoon.
The Court is now in recess.
(Court recesses from 1135H to 1331H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Chamber is now back in session.
And we'll give the floor to the <Co-Prosecutors> to put questions
to this Witness. You may proceed.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon.
Q. We were talking about the meeting you attended at which the
district chief provided instructions on the types -- categories
of people to be purged and I had asked you about -- for your
recollection as to who the district chief or who -- which
district leaders were present at that meeting. I'd like to read
to you from your interview, E319.1.21, and at answers 35 through
39 you testified that the person who chaired that meeting was
district committee, Chim. At question and answer number 37.
"Question: What was the name of the district committee? Answer:
His name was Chim."
And at question and answer 39: "Question: Did Chim, the district
committee, tell the participants of those meetings about the
types of people that had to be purged? Answer: Yes he did."
Does this refresh your recollection that the district chief who
chaired the meeting identifying the groups to be purged was Chim?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. Yes. It was Chim who addressed the meeting at that time.
Q. And do you remember -- was Chay also present at this meeting?
A. Yes. Ta Chay was also in the meeting.
Q. You indicated that at the same meeting, and this is from
E319.1.21, answer 43, you testified that you heard people from
Kampuchea Krom were accused of being "Yuon" spies and that the
Khmer Krom had to be killed. The evidence that has been admitted
by this Chamber includes lists from six different communes
identifying Khmer Krom and prepared in the same time period as
the Lon Nol documents we just looked at -- that is, April to May
1977. I don't want to tire you out looking at too many documents
but, with your leave, Mr. President, I'd like to provide two of
the Khmer Krom lists to the witness starting with E3/2281,
E3/2281, with your leave, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.
(Short pause)
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. Mr. Witness, the document that's just been presented to you is
a report signed by a cadre, Mon, dated the 4th of May, 1977,
which is titled "List of Kampuchea Krom people from Trapeang Thum
Cheung commune" -- your commune -- and it identifies 73 Khmer
Krom families living in that commune, including their former
occupation and the ranks of those who were former military.
First, can you tell us who was Mon, the person who signed this
report?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. Mon was the commune chief of Trapeang Thum Khang Cheung.
Q. And was Mon one of the commune representatives who was present
at the meeting you've described, where instructions were provided
on groups to be purged?
A. Yes, he was there.
Q. Can you take a look at this list and are you able to tell us
whether the Khmer Krom families on this list were people who were
originally from Trapeang Thum Cheung commune or whether they were
people who had been evacuated and relocated to the district from
Phnom Penh, Kampuchea Krom or other areas?
A. I have forgotten all these people. I do not know whether the
names here refer to those from Kampuchea Krom. <I cannot remember
and> I do not know them all.
Q. I'd like to show you now, Mr. Witness, two documents from
Popel commune. Mr. President, these are E3/2262 and E3/2917, with
your leave, if I may provide these documents to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.
MR. KOPPE:
Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Koppe.
MR. KOPPE:
Thank you. Just some clarification from the Prosecution. I
believe the witness was just shown E3/2281 and did I get that
right? And the witness was told that these lists -- or this list
consists of Kampuchea Krom families but to be honest I don't see
that in that document, so if the Prosecution would be so helpful
as to tell me where he sees Kampuchea Krom on this document?
MR. LYSAK:
Yes, I'd be happy to. This is one of these documents where
there's a difference in translations. In the Khmer original you
can see Kampuchea Krom, the French translation has Kampuchea
Krom, the English translation appears to have missed that so it
is there, it just was something that was missed in the English
translation.
MR. KOPPE:
Thank you very much, Mr. Prosecution -- Mr. Prosecutor for the
explanation but this is really getting troubling. Yesterday -- we
still haven't heard back by the way, Mr. President, from the IT
unit on this but there seems to be a big discrepancy between the
French translation of the original Khmer document and the English
translation. Yesterday we talked about the word 'eliminated' and
that word appeared, I think, about 20 or 40 times in the French
text. It didn't appear at all in the English text. Besides the
question, if the abbreviation KT should not just be literally
translated as KT and that the interpretation of what KT means
should be left to the Parties in their closing submissions to
argue. But these are all kinds of questions really to this
document, if now another essential ingredient of this document
seems to be lost in the English translation, which is, after all,
a working language, I think we're having substantial problems. We
are working in English so we must count on the fact that it is a
literal translation and that the French and the English
translations are the same.
MR. LYSAK:
Mr. President, if I may, I don't want to dwell on this very long.
This is certainly an issue that can be addressed. There are
procedures for this. There are many, many thousands of pages that
have been translated in the Case file. No one is perfect and when
these discrepancies arise they can be submitted to CMS and
corrected. It's part of the purpose of these Court proceedings so
we've identified one. CMS can look into it and make the necessary
corrections.
MR. KOPPE:
True as that may be, if I hadn't risen then -- if I hadn't paid
attention then this would have probably gone past us. I don't
think it's a detail problem or a marginal problem, it's a very
fundamental problem. There should be no mistake. There should be
no misunderstanding whatsoever between the -- with the
translations. That is a fundamental issue which possibly directs
-- affects this witness and upcoming witnesses so to stand now
and compare it with all the other thousand documents, I don't
think that is fair.
(Judges deliberate)
MR. PRESIDENT:
In relation to this matter, first, <>the Khmer document is the
original document so we need to rely on the original document --
that is, Khmer document -- the Khmer version <for the
discussion>. And <second,> I believe the Co-Prosecutor is aware
of the discrepancy of translation between English and Khmer, and
also the French. And I note that the <International>
Co-Prosecutor does not notify the ITU concerning the matter <in
order to make necessary correction before this hearing>, and they
allow this matter to arise again and again and the Chamber now
instructs <> the Parties, and particularly the <Co-Prosecutors>,
that if they find any discrepancy in relation to the document,
they may notify the ITU <so that correction can be made and all
parties can be informed in advance>. And <third, all parties are
comprised of national staff.> As for the Defence Teams, <there
are also national staff in the team, so> the National Counsel
<must actively> inform their colleagues concerning the <accuracy
of original document which is in Khmer> so that the proceeding
can move smoothly. The Chamber has taken action on this matter
again and again and we asked the senior legal officers to
coordinate with the CMS, and particularly ITU to deal with the
matter <and the discrepancy of translation could be avoided in
the future>. We have tried working very hard on the matter <once
and again but> the problem still occurs <because in this case,
there are many documents, millions of documents, millions of
pages. That is why the problem is still there. However, this
problem can probably be solved in the future>. You may now
proceed, <the International Deputy> Co-Prosecutor.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Thank you, Mr. President. We will certainly do our best to make
sure that all significant discrepancies are brought to the
attention.
Q. Mr. Witness, we were -- I just provided you with two documents
from Popel commune -- document E3/2917, is a report that was sent
from Popel commune in early May 1977, that refers to 64 Khmer
Krom families who had been received in an exchange with Vietnam.
And document E3/2262 is a list identifying 64 Khmer Krom families
living in that same commune, Popel commune, including their
former occupation. You have stated in interview E319.1.21, at
answer 97, that a group you called the "New Khmer Krom People"
meaning those, "[â¦] who had just come to live there, not the ones
who had been living in the villages for a long time." end of
quote, were particularly targeted by the Khmer Rouge.
My question for you is did the New Khmer Krom People, who you
said were targeted, include people who had been obtained in
exchanges or trades with Vietnam?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. As for the issue of exchanges or trades with Vietnam, I was
not aware of it. I only knew that < Kampuchea Krom people who
came with both> the wife and the husband, <>with no children<>
were the targets.
Q. Could you explain a little further as to who the people were
who you observed were targets?
A. The targeted people were the Kampuchea Krom people <who newly
arrived at the place. That could be only both> the husband and
wife <or adult people> with no children, they were identified as
"Yuon" spies -- agents or they were identified as KGB agents.
Q. And what was the significance of whether they had children or
not?
A. For those who came in the place with no children, they <were
the ones who worked for "Yuon"> according to the orders from the
<upper echelon>.
Q. We've seen -- I've shown you two examples of the lists that
were compiled by communes, identifying Khmer Krom. Do you
remember at the meeting you attended or at other occasions,
whether there were instructions given to register or prepare
lists of the Khmer Krom people living in each commune?
A. There were meetings <during which> commune and village chiefs
<were instructed> to prepare lists and the lists had to be sent
upwards.
Q. And do you remember who it was that gave the instruction to
the commune chiefs to prepare these lists?
A. The district committee.
Q. I want to ask you now about a couple of statements you made in
your OCIJ interviews. First, at interview E3/5511, answer 10, you
made the following statement, quote: "Vietnamese people were not
mentioned in the conference but later on all Vietnamese people
who lived in the village disappeared". End of quote. My question
for you is, where were these Vietnamese people living who
disappeared and when was it that they disappeared?
A. Those Vietnamese disappeared at night time or during the time
that they were working in the field or in the canal work sites.
These people were called out and then they were taken away.
Q. And in interview E319.1.21, referring you to question and
answer 103, it reads as follows: "Question: How did you know that
Khmer Krom people were sent to Krang Ta Chan prison or prison
204."
"Answer: I did not now about Krang Ta Chan prison but I knew they
were imprisoned at prison 204 because my hospital was located
along the roadside. One day, I saw a group of over 20 people
being escorted on foot from Kiri Vong district. They stopped at
my place to ask for medicines. I asked them what was happening to
those people and they said they were all KGB and "Yuon" spies and
they stated that the people were being sent to prison 204".
Can you first tell us, where was prison 204 located? How far away
was it from your hospital?
A. It was in Prey Kduoch commune, currently <in> Ou Saray
<commune>. It was about 17 or 18 kilometres away from my hospital
at that time.
Q. Do you remember what year it was when you saw this group of 20
people being arrested and taken towards prison 204?
A. I did not recall the year <because it was too long ago>. I
never think of it.
Q. And I wanted to clarify one thing. Did you believe that this
group of
prisoners was Khmer Krom? Were you told that they           20   were Khmer Krom or was all you were told by the cadres who
arrested them that they were people accused of being KGB or
"Youn" spies? Can you clarify that for us?
A. What I knew is that -- I was told that these people were Khmer
Krom and I was not told that these people were KGB or CIA. I was
just told that they were Khmer Krom <because those who were taken
away never came to meet me. Only the ones> who <were armed and>
escorted those <>Khmer Krom <people> came to me and asked for
medicines <at the hospital>.
Q. And do you know that the people who were escorting these
prisoners -- were they district cadres from Tram Kak, were they
sector cadres? Who were these people?
A. I do not know their names but I was told that they were from
Kiri Vong district -- that is, District 109.
Q. And do you know whether Prison 204 was a district prison, a
sector prison or a zone prison?
A. I did not know whether Prison 204 was <a> sector or district
prison, but this Prison 204 was in District 105.
Q. Did you visit the Prison 204 site after the fall of the Khmer
Rouge regime and if so, can you tell the Court what you saw when
you visited that site?
A. Prison 204 -- <from what I saw> the building was in bad
condition. There were two small buildings <made from leaves.>
Roof <and wall were made from> leaves and the buildings were in
bad condition. I went to farm near the place, <at Dach (phonetic)
mountain and Peang (phonetic) mountain>. Some farmers went to <do
rice farming> in the area and they found <>skulls <and skeletons,
but there were not many, just a few>.
Q. Did you see these remains -- human remains yourself or were
you just told about them?
A. After I returned from clearing the forest for plantation, I
saw a few skulls there and some other skeleton remains. However,
they were the skeleton remains of a few people and not many and I
believe they were thrown away by the peasants who got it from the
rice fields <because those were all skulls and skeletons which
were not buried.>.
Q. Thank you. Another group of people that you said the district
leaders instructed were to be purged were, and I quote from your
answer that I've read before, "people who went around speaking
against the Khmer Rouge", end of quote. Mr. President, at this
time I'd like to provide to the witness, with your leave,
document E3/4093, E3/4093.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed.
(Short pause)
BY MR. LYSAK:
Mr. Witness, I'm giving you two parts, two documents from
E3/4093. The first; Khmer, 00270786 through 87; English,
00831486; French, 00729674. This is a letter from Ta San dated
the 7th of August 1978, providing instructions to sweep clean the
widows from Trapeang Thum Khang Cheung who are currently staying
at the place of Comrade Meng. And the other document, Khmer,
00270788 through 89; English, 00831487 through 88; and French,
00729674 through 75; contains a note from Meng, dated the 8th of
August 1978, and appears to attach a report from Trapeang Thum
Cheung regarding five widows who had criticised the revolution
and planned to flee to Vietnam. My first question is did you know
who Comrade Meng was?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. No, I did not know this person.
Q. Do you know whether there was a unit called a "widows unit" in
Trapeang Thum Cheung commune?
A. Yes, there was. There was a widow unit.
Q. And can you explain -- what was the widows unit?
A. A widow<> unit comprised of those widows whose husband died
<>or that they were no longer with their husbands and <both>
women from Phnom Penh <and base women who were no longer with
their husbands lived and worked together in the unit>.
Q. Do you know why these women were put in a separate unit?
A. I did not know the reason for this widow<> unit.
Q. I want to refer now to a statement from your DC-Cam interview,
.409. This reference is at Khmer, 00418846; English,
00729063; and French, 00808645; and you made the following
statement at that part of your DC-Cam interview, quote: "In
political and enemy terms, there were so-called enemies allegedly
infiltrating among patients or following one another. We were
ordered to identify such enemies."
My question to you is, who was it that ordered the district
hospital to identify enemies amongst patients?
A. It was the district committee or district secretary.
Q. Was there a particular district chief who provided this
instruction or was this something that was instructed by all the
people who served as district chief?
A. There was a general instruction for all, <not only> the
hospital <but all villages> regarding this matter.
Q. I'd now like to ask you a few questions relating to a couple
of issues of the CPK publication, "Revolutionary Flag". With you
leave, Mr. President, I'd first like to provide to the witness
the April 1977, issue of "Revolutionary Flag" which is document,
E3/742.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes you may proceed.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Mr. Witness, this document is the April 1977 issue of
"Revolutionary Flag". April 1977, is a time period we have been
discussing in the documents I have been showing you today and if
you'd start by looking at the very end of this issue -- at the
very last page or second to last page. At the end of this issue
the Party cadres were provided the following instruction, quote:
"Number 1: Every base area and every unit must organise the study
of this document. Number 2: It is imperative to organise that
study primarily collectively, then there must be additional study
by group or individually." End of quote. I'd like to read a
couple of passages to you from the April 1977 issue of
"Revolutionary Flag", to see if you recall ever receiving
instruction on these matters by the leaders of Tram Kak district.
The first reference is at Khmer, 00062986; English, 00478496; and
French, 00499754; which contains the following statement, quote:
"As for the enemies that are CIA, KGB and "Yuon" agents, the
cheap running dogs of the enemy that sneakily embed inside our
revolution and our revolutionary ranks[â¦]", continuing below,
"[â¦] We must continue to strike them and trample them from our
position of absolute advantage and must constantly be on the
offensive against them during 1977 to smash them even more so
they cannot raise their heads." End of quote.
The second passage I want to refer you to is at Khmer, 00062991;
English, 00478501; and French 00499758; which reads as follows,
quote:
"It is imperative to indoctrinate and whip up the masses into a
force to seek out the enemy, assess the enemy, analyse the enemy,
track the enemy, pressure the enemy, capture the enemy, to smash
the enemy and to make the enemy be like a rat surrounded by a
crowd of people beating and smashing it." End of quote.
And the last passage I want to refer you to is at Khmer,
00062994; English, 00478502 through 03; and French, 00499760;
which reads as follows, quote:
"Each location must take the leadership role to push the mission
profoundly in order to further seize, expand and increase the
power of socialist revolution. So the power of socialist
revolution will trample the enemy and trample the remnants of the
various oppressor classes, trample the remnants of the various
private ownership regimes and smash them to bits to prevent them
from being able to raise their heads no matter where they are,
even if they are at some small location." End of quote.
Q. Mr. Witness, do you recall issues like this being discussed at
any of the district meetings you attended?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. On the issue of the "Revolutionary Flag" magazine, personally
I never saw it during the regime.
Q. Do you remember -- was the "Revolutionary Flag" ever read at
any of the meetings you attended? Read by the district leaders?
A. No. I never heard them say anything regarding this matter.
Q. Do you remember receiving -- aside from the issue of
"Revolutionary Flag" -- do you remember receiving instructions or
directions along the lines of what I just read -- that is, that
cadres were to be on the lookout for enemies?
A. No.
Q. Mr. President, the next two documents I would like to provide
to the witness are E3/135 -- E3/135 and E3/289. E3/135 is the
July 1977, "Revolutionary Flag", E3/289 is a copy of a Democratic
Kampuchea radio broadcast.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed.
MR. KOPPE:
Mr. President, I have an objection. We have just established that
the witness has never seen a "Revolutionary Flag". I know you
allow witnesses to be shown documents that we haven't established
before that they actually have seen it, but now that we have
established it I don't really see the point in showing him a
"Revolutionary Flag" again, so I object.
MR. LYSAK:
Mr. President, this is the -- these are the two different
documents that announced the award of the honorary "Red Flag" to
Tram Kak district. It was done both through "Revolutionary Flag"
and on the radio so I've given the witness both documents to see
whether either of them refresh his recollection about this event.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The objection raised by the Defence Counsel is denied and the
Chamber allows the documents to be shown to the witness. And Mr.
Witness, please refer to the document and respond to the question
that will be put to you by the <International Deputy
Co-Prosecutor>.
BY MR. LYSAK:
And for the record, Mr. President, the excerpt from E3/289 --
that is, the particular radio broadcast, is at pages Khmer,
01064303 through 307, English, 00168509 through 511; and French,
01066907 through 910. Mr. Witness, the reason I provided these
documents to you is that on 30th June 1977, approximately two
months after some of the documents and events we've been
discussing, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
Kampuchea awarded the honorary "Red Flag" to Tram Kak district,
recognising it as one of three model districts in all of
Democratic Kampuchea. That award was both announced in the
"Revolutionary Flag" issue that I gave you and announced in the
radio broadcast that is in the second document I provided to you.
Q. My question; do you remember hearing that Tram Kak had been
recognized by the Khmer Rouge leaders as a model district in
Democratic Kampuchea?
MR. SON RIEL:
A. No, I did not hear about that, nor was I told about it.
Q. This morning, you told my colleague about seeing Khieu Samphan
in Tram Kak district at one point. Other than Khieu Samphan, did
you see any other Khmer Rouge leaders come to Tram Kak district?
A. No, I did not.
Q. What about Ta Mok? How often did you see him between April
1975 and January 1979?
A. I saw him three to four times during the regime <but I have
forgotten>.
Q. Can you tell the Court where it was that you--
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Prosecution, please <hold on>. Defence Counsel Kong Sam Onn,
you have the floor.
MR. KONG SAM ONN:
Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to make an observation
regarding the line of questioning by the <Co-Prosecutor>. I think
it leads to misunderstanding <of witness statement>. That in his
previous response, he stated he saw Khieu Samphan during the
period of 1957 or '58. And then the National Co-Prosecutor tried
to clarify whether it was in '67 or '68. However, just then the
International Co-Prosecutor <first tried> to link <>the year that
the witness encountered or met Ta Mok to the time or the year
that this witness saw Mr. Khieu Samphan <and then the
International Co-Prosecutor asked about Ta Mok which was from>
'75 to '79. <This led to confusion of the time when the witness
met Mr. Khieu Samphan.> That is my observation, Mr. President.
MR. LYSAK:
I'll respond briefly. First, I wasn't making any link. Second,
Counsel, you've misstated; you've completely misstated the
evidence from this morning. This witness testified to two things.
One, that he heard that Khieu Samphan came to meet with Ta Mok in
'57 to '58, '67 to '68. Second, he testified that during the
period he was working at the Khpob Trabek dam, on one day he went
with the wife of Ta Mok and saw Khieu Samphan. Two separate
testimonies. In any event, there's no link being made here. I'm
asking this witness now about when he saw Ta Mok. That's the
question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The <> International <Deputy> Co-Prosecutor, in fact you may
proceed. There is no need to wait for the ruling from the
Chamber, as the Defence Counsel only made an observation, <> not
an objection.
MR. KONG SAM ONN:
The Co-Prosecutor just stated <new facts> that he saw Khieu
Samphan at <Kampong> Trabek, <but the witness had not yet raised
this point> and I think <this could lead to confusion.>.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the <> International <Deputy> Co-Prosecutor, please rephrase
your last question to the witness.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Witness, you said you remember
seeing Ta Mok three or four times during the Khmer Rouge regime.
Can you tell us where it was that you would see Ta Mok?
MR. SON RIEL:
A. I saw Ta Mok while he was in a vehicle, <which was> alongside
the road <near my worksite. I saw him in a vehicle>. And in fact,
there was only one time that he stopped his car near where I
worked, but he didn't get out of the car.
Q. On any of these occasions, did you talk to Ta Mok when he was
driving, driving on the road near your hospital?
A. No, I did not <meet> him. <When I saw him, I would run away
and hide myself>, as I was scared of him.
Q. Why were you scared of Ta Mok?
A. I did not know why. <>I was scared of him, and I was not the
only one. Many other people felt the same thing. <When we saw
him, we would run away and hide ourselves. We dared not stay
close to him.>
Q. While we're talking about Ta Mok, I wanted to ask you a few
questions about some of his relatives, and in particular, whether
they had positions in the Khmer Rouge regime. This morning you've
already identified for my colleague a brother of Ta Mok named
Cham. Did Ta Mok also have a brother named Chong (phonetic), and
if so, what position did Chong (phonetic) hold during the Khmer
Rouge regime?
A. Ta Mok had a younger brother by the name of Cham. He was the
Khpob Trabek commune chief.
Q. Perhaps my pronunciation was not very good. I was talking
about the other brother of Ta Mok, a person who, I believe, was
named Chong (phonetic). Did you know Chong (phonetic)? Did you
know what position he held during the regime?
A. I knew that <he had another> younger brother, named Chong
(phonetic), he was <a> secretary of District 55 -- that is,
<Prey> Kabbas district.
Q. And you discussed this morning a sister of Ta Mok, named
Koeun, who held a position at the zone or sector hospital. Was
this the sister who was married to Ta San?
A. Yes, <Yeay> Koeun was the wife of Ta San.
Q. And I just wanted to clarify something about the hospitals,
the sector hospitals. In your DC-Cam interview, .409, at
Khmer, 00418835; English, 00729050; and French, 00808631; you
stated as follows, quote: "Sector health centres were located in
Daeum Chambak school, and Trapeang Roneab." End of quote.
I wanted you to clarify two things. One, were there more than one
sector health centre, more than one sector hospital? And second,
can you clarify which hospital it was that Koeun worked at?
A. The zone hospital, <>that's for the general treatment <of
people>, there was one at <Sala (phonetic) Daeum > Chambak. And
there was a military hospital for the treatment of soldiers. It
was <>Hospital 22, and there was a sector hospital at Trapeang
<Roneam>, that was for the <> treatment of <general> people as
well.
Q. And the military hospital, the one called Hospital 22, where
was that located?
A. Hospital 22 was located at Pou Doh <village>, Trapeang Thum
Khang Cheung <commune>.
Q. And which of these hospitals was the one that Koeun worked at?
A. <The hospital which Yeay> Koeun worked <at was Sala
(phonetic)> Daeum Chambak <hospital>.
Q. I'd like to turn now to a few questions about the daughters of
Ta Mok. We've already talked about one of his daughters, Khom,
who you identified as a Tram Kak district secretary for a period.
Did Ta Mok have another daughter, named Ho or Hoe (phonetic), and
what positions did she hold during the Khmer Rouge regime?
A. As for the <daughters> of Ta Mok, I only know one. That is,
Yeay Khom. <Apart from her,> I did not know the other daughters
as they were not at home while I was there.
Q. So, you don't -- Do I understand you correctly, you don't
remember his other daughters well enough to tell us whether they
had positions in any hospitals in the southwest zone?
A. Yes.
Q. I want to turn now to a matter you've testified about in your
OCIJ interviews, and that is a trip you made to Krang Ta Chan
prison. In interview E319.1.21, at answer 125, you described this
visit to Krang Ta Chan prison, testifying as follows, quote:
"Many prisoners died of malaria at the prison then. Ta Chim, who
was district committee, wrote a letter to my hospital, requesting
us to spray DDT inside the prison to kill mosquitoes. When I got
there, I saw many prisoners." And continuing below, at answers
128 to 130:
"Question: Were those prisoners shackled when you saw them?"
"Answer: I saw all of them lying on the floor. There were about
three or four rows of them."
"Question: Did you talk to the chairman of Krang Ta Chan prison?"
"Answer: Yes, I talked with him, and he gave instructions on
where to spray the insecticide."
"Question: How many times did you spray at Krang Ta Chan prison?"
"Answer: Only once."
You indicated in this statement that many prisoners had died of
malaria at the prison. How did you know this?
A. I was aware of it because if the prisoners <had not died from>
malaria, I would not <have been> called to spray the insecticide;
<there were a lot of mosquitoes>.
Q. Do you remember when it was that you made this trip to spray
insecticide in Krang Ta Chan? Do you remember the year?
A. I did not recall it. I did not know when it was.
Q. You indicated that, when you were there, you talked to the
chairman of Krang Ta Chan prison, who gave you instructions on
where to spray the insecticide. Who was the prison chairman that
you talked to?
A. It was An, the prison chief. He asked me to spray the
insecticide<>.
Q. Do you remember approximately how long you were at Krang Ta
Chan that day, while you were spraying the insecticides?
A. I was there for half an hour. And <we> sprayed <a total of>
five buckets of the insecticide. <Each of us sprayed a bucket of
insecticide.> I was there for half an hour.
Q. In your interview E3/5511, at answer number 18, you made the
following statement, quote: "While spraying I met a man from
Hanoi who was also a prisoner, but he was outside the cell. I
asked him to take care of Han." And I'm going to ask you some
more questions about Han later. First, I want to ask you about
this man from Hanoi. Who was this man who you saw at Krang Ta
Chan? And how did you know he was from Hanoi?
A. I knew that he was from Hanoi because after his arrival from
Hanoi, he worked with the commune chief. He went to various
commune chiefs, to various communes. He <had left for> Hanoi
<since he was 13> years <old>, and <only when he became mature
did> he return<> to Cambodia. <>I knew him because he <went to
work in various villages>.
Q. So this is someone who had been in Hanoi for three years, but
then had returned, and had a position in Tram Kak district? Do I
understand correctly?
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. Do you remember the name of this person?
A. His name was Chea (phonetic).
Q. And in -- also in regards to your visit to Krang Ta Chan, do
you remember approximately how many prisoners were there on the
day that you visited the prison?
A. I looked into one building <in which I saw> four rows of
prisoners, <and from my estimation, in that building which was
the longest one,> there were about <more than> 100 prisoners,
<who were lying directly on the ground>. And after I glanced into
the building, I walked away.
MR. LYSAK:
Mr. President, I was going to change to another subject now. I
can either continue or move to the new subject after the break.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is now appropriate time for a short break. The Court will take
a short break from now until 3 o'clock <and please be back in the
courtroom>.
Court officer, please find a proper place for the witness <and
his duty counsel> during the break time, and have him return,
together with his duty counsel, back into the courtroom at 3
o'clock.
The Court is now adjourned.
(Court recesses from 1439H to 1502H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated. The Court is back in session, and the Chamber
hands over the floor to the <> International <Deputy>
Co-Prosecutor to put questions to this witness. You may proceed.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Witness, I have one more subject
that I want to cover with you today. That concerns the arrests of
some cadres from hospitals in Tram Kak and the Southwest Zone,
and in particular, the arrest of a woman medic from your
hospital, that you've testified about. In interview E319.1.21, at
answer 132, you provided the following testimony regarding the
arrest of a female medic named Han from your hospital. I quote:
"There was a letter from the district ordering her dismissal, and
then they took her out of the hospital and sent her straight to
Krang Ta Chan prison. They told me that the woman had had a
relationship with Ta Kang, who was a senior Khmer Rouge cadre."
End of quote.
And in question and answer 134, quote: "Ta Kang was arrested by
Pol Pot. The woman used to work with Ta Kang, and that was why
she was arrested, because she was considered one of Ta Kang's
operatives." End of quote. Can you first tell the Court who Ta
Kang was?
MR. SON RIEL:
A. Ta Kang was the chief of <> Hospital 22. At the time, the
woman, Han, was with him.
Q. Just to make sure I understand, Kang was the chief of the zone
hospital, Hospital 22, and Han was someone who used to work for
Kang at that hospital. Do I understand correctly?
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. Did you see Han on the day when you visited Krang Ta Chan to
spray insecticide?
A. I met Han. She was cooking rice, a small pot of rice.
Q. Mr. President, at this time I'd like to provide to the witness
two documents, E3/4164 and E3/4145. These are two prisoner lists
from Krang Ta Chan that I would like to ask the witness about,
with your leave.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.
(Short pause)
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. Mr. Witness, I've given you two documents. The first, E3/4164,
and the relevant pages here are Khmer, 00079337-38; English,
00973147; and French 00937104. This is a list entitled "Brief
Biographies of Prisoners at Tram Kak District Education Office",
and I want to refer you to the second and third people on the
list. In particular, the third person on this list is a female
named Uch Han, a 26-year-old medic from Trapeang Kol, who was
arrested on the 23rd May 1977, and the comment for Uch Han
indicates that she was implicated in the responses of Hang and
Kang. My first question to you: Is the woman identified in this
record as Uch Han the same person you have described who was
arrested from your hospital and taken to Krang Ta Chan?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. That was the woman.
Q. And so it's clear, was Han one of the prisoners who survived
Krang Ta Chan and was released?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember when she was released from Krang Ta Chan?
A. I did not know <as to> when she was released.
Q. But there is a second female medic referred to in both of the
lists that I've provided to you, who's listed next to Uch Han,
named Vorng Sarun. She was a 27-year-old medic from Hospital 22,
who was arrested on the same date as Han, the 23rd of May 1977,
and the comments for both of these women in both prisoner lists
are the same. They're both described as people who were
implicated in the responses of Hang and Kang. Do you remember
this woman medic, Vorng Sarun?
A. I never knew this person.
MR. LYSAK:
Mr. President, with your leave I'd like to now provide to the
witness a document, D157.13, D157.13, which is one of the
documents that's been identified as a notebook from Krang Ta
Chan, with your leave.
MR. KOPPE:
Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Koppe.
MR. KOPPE:
Only a request for clarification in relation to the previous
document. Did I hear the Prosecution say Vorng Sarun? Or did I
just mishear that? Because I have Rang Sarun (phonetic).
MR. LYSAK:
This is again a situation where we have multiple translations. We
have two different documents. We have a list in which her first
name is Vorng. We have notes of her interrogation in which she's
identified as Vorng. So, there are about four or five different
references to this individual in the various Krang Ta Chan
records. The reference as, Rang (phonetic), is the only one out
of many references. So, we're happy to refer this, again, to the
CMS people, but I'm using the name of -- the most common name of
this person.
MR. KOPPE:
I am happy to accept this explanation, but I would also be able
to verify, what the Prosecution is saying. So, where exactly is
Rang, Vorng? In which document, so that I can follow what the
International Co-Prosecutor is saying.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Let me just take two minutes then to put on the record the
various references to this person, so it's clear. First, in this
document E3/4164, she is again, as I've said, identified as a
27-year-old female from Khcheay village, I may not be pronouncing
this correctly, a medic from Hospital 22, who was implicated in
the responses of Hang and Kang. On -- in document E3/4145, the
first page, again there is a person identified with Uch Han. In
this one, the name is translated as Vorng Sanu. Again, a
27-year-old female medic from Khcheay, from Hospital 22, who is
indicated as someone who was implicated by Hang. In document
D157.7, this is a notebook from Krang Ta Chan, at Khmer,
00270874; English, 00866433-34; French, 00872808-09; are
contained the notes of the interrogation of a Vorng Sarun,
26-year-old female from Khcheay village, who worked at Hospital
22.
And there is also a reference to a Ruan (phonetic) in the
document that I was about to question the witness about. So, to
respond to Counsel too, it is very common, particularly with
spellings of names, for there to be differences in translations.
We're -- we will certainly follow your directive with respect to
significant things. I don't think that we would be able to notify
CMS every time there is a difference in how names were translated
or spelt. I hope I can proceed at this point with the next
document, which is D157.13.
Mr. President, with your leave, I'd like to submit this document
to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.
(Short pause)
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. Mr. Witness, the document I've just handed you is a notebook,
and it contains notes of the interrogation of a cadre from
Hospital 22, named Hun Hang. You'll find that reference at Khmer,
00270827-29; English, 01064174-76; French, 00971285-288. And the
prisoner lists, that I just showed you, indicated that Ouch Han
had been implicated by two people, Kang, who you've already
identified, but also by someone named Hang. And I'd like you to
look at these pages that relate to this Hun Hang person. First of
all, tell me, do you remember a cadre named Hang who worked at
Hospital 22?
MR. SON RIEL:
A. I do not remember. I do not recognize this individual. I never
went to that <Hospital 22>. I <only> knew <> the name <of Ta>
Kang, and I never saw this person personally.
Q. Now, in Hun Hang's notes, he refers to Kang as achar Kang. Did
you hear the person Kang, who was the head of Hospital 22
referred to as achar Kang?
A. I heard there was a person by the name <of> Kang, the chief of
Hospital 22. I do not know whether there were <other individuals
by the name of> Kang<>.
Q. And if you look at the notes on the pages I've provided,
there's a list of 16 cadres -- 16 hospital medics. And I'd just
like you to take a quick look at those 16 names, who are
identified as being medics or people who worked at various
hospitals including Trapeang Kol, and tell me if you remember, or
knew, any of these people?
A. What are the names? I cannot find those names.
MR. KOPPE:
I'm lost too, Mr. President. Could you, Mr. Prosecutor, please
give us the document number again?
BY MR. LYSAK:
Yes, it's the same document, D157.13, and if you look at Khmer
page -- it should be 00270828-29, you'll see a list of 16 names.
They're numbered. Same thing in the English translation. It
appears at 1064175-176, a list of 16 people. And the French ERN
range is -- these notes are in 00971285-88, You'll find the same
list of 16 people there.
Q. My question is simply for you to look at the names of the 16
hospital medics or cadres, and tell me if you knew any of those
people?
MR. SON RIEL:
A. I cannot read the names <on the list> because the document is
not clear to me.
Q. Fair enough. In your interview E3/5511, at answer 21, you made
the following statement about Kang: "I think Kang was the chief
of the zone hospital. He was arrested and executed by the Khmer
Rouge, and Neary Han was arrested as she worked with Kang." End
of quote. Do you remember what year it was, when it was, that
Kang was arrested?
A. I do not remember the <exact date>.
Q. Let me read to you an excerpt from a document, E3/2120. This
is E3/2120. This is the book by Meng-Try Ea, "The Chain of
Terror". This is only in English, at 00416443-416444. This is a
report of an interview of a driver of Ta Mok, and the passage
reads as follows, quote:
"One day in late 1976, after returning from Phnom Penh, Ta Mok
called a member of the Southwest Zone committee named achar Kang
to his house. After the two men talked for a moment, Ta Mok
ordered his soldiers to arrest achar Kang, place him in shackles
and put him in a car. Achar Kang's S21 confession states that he
had been arrested and sent to S21 for interrogation on
October  
          2   1976." End of quote.
Now, Mr. Witness, you indicated in your OCIJ interviews, at one
point you stated that Kang had been arrested by Pol Pot. And in
the second excerpt I read, you said he was arrested and executed
by the Khmer Rouge. My first question to you is, how did you
learn -- from whom did you learn, that achar Kang had been
arrested by Pol Pot?
A. I heard from a villager, or people, living near the Hospital
22. <All> people <living> around the hospital knew about that,
and they told me.
Q. The last document, and last questions I have for you -- Mr.
President, with your leave I'd like to provide to the witness a
copy of E3/1135, that's E3/1135, which is a document that relates
to achar Kang.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.
BY MR. LYSAK:
Q. Mr. Witness, the document that I've handed to you is a report
from the 19th of October, 1976, from Muth. It discusses -- it's a
report regarding the wife of achar Kang, who had been
hospitalized in Division 164, but who had disappeared. And there
are a number of people who were identified as her associates: a
man named Chheng and a man named Ban.
And then there is a note on this report dated the 20th of
October, addressed to Bong Nuon, that states, quote: "Now achar
Kang's wife has already left the division hospital. Two: Request
to search for Chheng and Ban, who are related to this matter."
End of quote. My first question for you is did you know the wife
of achar Kang?
MR. RIEL SON:
A. I do not know. I do not know Kang's face, and I only <heard of
his name, and> knew that he was the head of Hospital 22.
Q. Did you know whether there was a hospital in Kampong Saom, and
whether cadres or people from the Southwest Zone sometimes went
to that hospital?
A. I was not aware of it.
Q. And my last question is -- simply relates to the two people
associated with achar Kang's wife, who are identified in this
document, that is the men named Chheng and Ban. Do either of
those names ring a bell to you? Did you know who either of they
were?
A. For the two individuals, I did not know them.
MR. LYSAK:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for bearing with me today with
a lot of documents. I appreciate your time. Mr. President, I have
no further questions.
MR. KOPPE:
Just, Mr. President, a request for clarification on the -- not
the last document, and also not Meng-Try's book, but the document
before. The list of 16 names. We were just not able, all of us
here, to follow the Prosecution. So, if he would again be so kind
and tell us to which page he was referring?
MR. LYSAK:
I'll assume you're looking at -- want to look at the English
pages. The English pages are 01064175 and 01064176, of document
D157.13. There is a section that starts on one page, continues on
the next. The first -- the list of 16 starts with these words:
"The associates who joined the traitorous activities with the
contemptible Kang, and whom he always promoted or sent for
technical classes, are as follows". And then there's a list of 16
people.
MR. KOPPE:
Just for the record, Mr. President, the reason why we couldn't
follow is that it seems that the old translations said that the
document was intelligible and that the new document was added to
the case file. That's what I'm getting from the back. I don't
know if that's correct, but just for the record. If it's not,
please, I stand corrected.
MR. LYSAK:
We listed this document on the interface. I just printed it out
from ZyLAB, so I have no idea why you cannot, why you would not
be able to access it. It's on ZyLAB, so.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Actually, the document is on the case file and the National
Counsel, please try to locate that document, at least in the
Khmer language. I think you need to manage within your own team,
try to locate the relevant documents <in a timely manner>.
The Chamber would like now to hand the floor to the Lead
Co-Lawyers for civil parties to put <questions> to this witness.
You may proceed.
QUESTIONING BY MY. LOR CHUNTHY:
Thank you and good afternoon to, Your Honours, and everyone. My
name is Lor Chunthy, <a> lawyer for civil parties, and good
afternoon, Mr. Witness. I'd like to put some questions to you,
and the first subject is in relation to your <profession>.
Q. When you attended the two study sessions -- that is, the two
medical trainings, and one of which you engaged in the human
anatomy, did you only study this topic in theory or was there
actually a hand-on practice on live human beings?
MR. SON RIEL:
A. Actually, we only studied it in theory, that is, on paper,
with no live subject.
Q. In that study session, how many participants for each<>
session<> that you attended?
A. There were medics from the communes; actually there were 12
medic communes and there were<> two district medics.
Q. And <for> the trainer, where did the trainer come from? And
please tell the name if you can recall the name.
A. Sei was the trainer and, actually, Sei was chief of the sector
hospital.
Q. While you worked at the hospital, you stated that there were
many patients, and on a daily basis, there were almost 100 male
and female patients. How many actual medical staff were there
together in your hospital? I do not want you to refer to the
support staff as you stated this morning. <I want to know as to
how many staff of yours who had medical expertise.>
A. The medical staff who <had expertise and> could engage in
treatment, there were <>two <male> medics, in addition to myself.
<>And there were about five female medics. When I talked about
the number of patients, <that is 30 patients per day> who came
for the treatment, they were actually not in-house patients. They
just came to ask for medicines and then they left. <However,
there were only about four or five patients per day, who had to
hospitalize.> And <it was the same case at> the women's section.
<They came to ask for medicines and left. I thought> there were
more than 100 patients a day <in women's section>. However,
<there were still some, about 10 or 20 people who were> in
patients.
Q. And <in terms of> the medicines for the treatment of those
patients, were the medicines traditional or modern, and who
actually supplied you with the medicines?
A. I'd like to talk about the traditional medicines. I had a few
staff who <were in charge of collecting> herbal medicines<>, and
<the> few female medics <were the one who made and used that>
traditional medicine. <For modern medicines, I could not
remember; there were probably eight or nine female staff. Some
worked on steaming water, some mixed medicine while some others
cleaned the tube or refill them.> That's for <our own> use within
the hospital. <There was serum to be cleaned as well.>
Q. The main point that I'd like to ask you is the following: How
effective was that medicine?
A. It varied. The <traditional> medicines that we produced,
sometimes it produced a good result; for example, for the
treatment of diarrhoea. But in other cases, it didn't work, so we
had to supply the patient with the modern medicine. We actually
had a few <modern> medicines <made by ourselves. There were
Calcium,> B1, B12, etc., <For mixed medicine, we had to buy
medicine from outside to mix>. And, of course, <at first the
medicine was effective, but later on it was not really> effective
for the treatment.
Q. <Thank you.> What was your observation on the children who
might have been sent for the treatment at your hospital? Were
there many children?
A. <At that time,> there were many children <who went to carry
cow dung when they came back, they would stop by outside the
hospital and> would come to the hospital to ask for medicine for
the treatment of a headache or diarrhoea. And, in fact, <there
were 10 to 20> children <every day.> They <were tasked to
collect> cow dung <in> the nearby villages. And usually they
would come to ask for medicine <on their way back from work>.
Q. The diseases that you treated, as you stated, include the
dysentery and the swelling nature of the illness. Were the
patients fully treated <and did they recover from the diseases>?
Was there a relapse or did some of them die due to the lack of
medicine?
A. For the patient<> whose body was swelling or who had
dysentery, they came for the treatment, and, of course, not all
of them could be fully treated <by medicine. Sometimes,> while
they were there, we would provide them with <enough> cooked rice
<>for five to 10 days and then they recovered. <Some who had
diarrhoea recovered because of medicine.> And <if food and
medicine were provided but> their symptom could not be
improved<>, I would refer them to the sector hospital. And in
other cases, they died.
Q. <Did> many patients <die>?
A. Toward the later regime of the Khmer Rouge -- that is, about
one <>month<> before the collapse of the regime, many, many
patients died <and there were too many to count>. And <those who
had to bury the corpses did not stay still because they> had to
dig pits to <bury> those <dead> patients<>, maybe 10 to 20 <dead
patients> every day. <This happened towards the end of Khmer
Rouge regime.>
Q. Did you know the real cause of the so many deaths towards the
later part of the regime?
A. Yes, because initially we were provided with 25 to 50 cans of
rice for <more than 200 people at> the hospital, but <later on>
we were not given that rice, so <I tried to collect rice from
here and there until all patients were transferred to their
respective bases. We also asked the patient's relatives to pick
up those patients at the hospital, and for those whose house was
far away, someone would take them to their house. When all
patients were transferred out of the hospital,> it was the time
that we had to flee already.
Q. While you were at that hospital, did you receive any pregnant
women who went there for <delivery>?
A. Yes, we did. <We received pregnant women> quite frequently.
Sometimes we would receive them two or three <times> per month.
Sometimes <some of> those women<> delivered their babies at the
base. We also had five or six midwives who were skillful in
<maternal care> and I myself also have expertise in this area.
Q. On the technique of <birth> delivery and the issue of <birth>
delivery, <was there any death> during the delivery?
A. No, <when those women came to deliver their baby> at the
hospital, there was no such case. However, on other instances,
the mother survived, but a baby died during the delivery and
sometimes we had to engage in Caesarean operation to rescue the
<mother> or to use a suction cup. <So we managed to rescue only
the mother, not the baby.>
Q. I'd like to move on to another subject. You talked about the
conference that you attended where you heard instructions
regarding the <smash and> purges. Who <>actually called people to
attend the conference and who actually chaired that conference?
<How many participants were there in this conference?>
A. That conference was chaired by the district <secretary. The
district secretary was the one who invited people to the
conference> through the district office <chief> there. And <the>
participants <varied depending on> the district committee, but I
observed that <all> commune chiefs were called, <and some village
chiefs were called sometimes while some other village chiefs>
were not.
Q. After you received that instruction, who was responsible for
the implementation of that instruction?
A. In fact, <those were> people in the leadership who had to
implement that instruction; that is <all> unit <chiefs>, village
<chiefs>, <and> commune chief<s>.
Q. Did you yourself <encounter> the implementation of that
instruction <on a particular individual>?
A. The only thing that I experienced <personally> was that my
uncle and my elder brother-in-law were taken away <from my
house>. In fact, in regard to <this case>, I didn't witness it
myself <until> my wife came to tell me about it and when I ran
home, <they had> already <been taken away.  Apart from this, I
did not know>.
Q. In response to a question on the letter by the district
committee -- that is, in regards to a former major <who
hospitalized at your hospital>, and you stated that the person
had already been sent <out>, can you tell the Court what happened
later on to this former major?
A. I am afraid that that <Major> died <already because one>
night, he really liked me, and while he was in my hospital <and
his room was next to mine. We sat down and talked for almost the
whole night>, he told me that he was a former major and next day,
I saw a letter from the district secretary that he was looking
for this major from Romchang commune and that he had to be sent
back to his base. <They stressed that he had to be sent back
regardless of his condition.> And I knew that that would be a
problem for him. Then I <wrote a letter and asked> a messenger
<to send it to the district secretary. I told the district chief
that> that patient <was sent> back home three days ago. And I
told <>the patient to <have a ride in> a horse cart, which was
being used to transport food supplies in Romchang village, which
was his village. So, he actually got on that horse cart and went
<away but I do not know what could happen to him and he
disappeared until now.> And <if he was still alive,> he <would
be> a good person <to know. Just for a short period of time, I
became very fond of him. It happened so quickly that> I did not
learn of his name at that time.
Q. So, in your account, that Major got on a horse cart and
disappeared <until now>. And in your document E3/5511, in
question-answer number 12, you talked about the commune committee
and there <were> three people <on> that committee, <Chief, Deputy
Chief and one member>. And a little bit further down <one
paragraph>, you also stated that a member of the committee was a
policeman who was in charge of making arrests of people. My
question to you is the following. Does it mean one of the three
people <on> the committee was <a soldier> -- that is, was in
charge of making arrests of people, is that what you mean?
A. <Yes, amongst> the three members of the committee,<> the
deputy chief of the committee was performing a policeman role --
that is, engaging in making arrests.
Q. You stated that you were sent to spray insecticide at the
Krang Ta Chan prison. How many of you actually went to that
prison?
A. There were five of us, including myself.
Q. How far was the prison from the hospital where you worked?
A. The distance was about six to seven kilometres, <but I never
measured it>.
Q. Upon your arrival, you engaged in spraying the insecticide
and, actually, upon your observation, can you tell the Court what
kinds or how many types of insects <> there <were> at the prison?
A. In fact, it was not the prison chief who requested me to go
there. It was the district committee or district secretary who
sent <us> to spray insecticide at the <> bushes near the area in
order to <get rid of mosquitoes, the main causes of dengue fever
and> malaria.
Q. When you were spraying insecticide around the prison compound
and upon your observation, how many prison buildings did you see?
A. <When I arrived there,> I saw three big buildings and two
small buildings. The big buildings, they were big in size and
long in length.
Q. This is my last question to you. When you arrived at the
prison, did you <learn> of any information about the prisoners
who were detained there or <> whether <> those prisoners were
tortured?
A. No, <>I did not know whether <> prisoners were tortured,
because when I was there, I did not see any interrogation or any
torture site. However, we were prohibited <from entering and
spraying insecticide in> a certain <building> -- that is,
<located> to the south part of the compound.
Q. Did you see a building in that prohibited area? <What big was
it?>
A. It was a <relatively> small building. It was about five metres
by six metres. <I looked at the building from a distance of about
30-40 metres.>.
Q. Did you feel any bad smell when you were around in that area?
A. No, there was no foul smell, because <that insecticide already
produced its own> smell. <It was DDT power which we sprayed;
thus, I did not smell anything.> Each of us had to spray a bucket
of <> insecticide and after we finished <the task>, we <bid them
goodbye>.
MR. LOR CHUNTHY:
Mr. President, I don't have any further questions. And Mr.
Witness, thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel Koppe, you have the floor.
MR. KOPPE:
Yes, Mr. President, I do apologize to revisit this document issue
again, because there is something strange going on with this
document. Because, what we have in the paper version is D157.13.
It says here this handwriting document is illegible, so there's
no translation. One would expect there's a corrected document of
157.13, sorry, D157.13. We cannot find such a correction. So,
because we cannot find a correction, we were basing ourselves
upon this D157.13, which says this handwriting document is
illegible.
So, in regard to ZyLAB, we see there is a creation date still at
6 May, 2010. So what it looks like is that this document has been
recently translated without any notification, which seems odd in
the light of the fact that it is, indeed, a very difficult to
read document in the original Khmer.
So, my point is to indicate we are not unorganized, but there is
something strange going on with this particular document, so we
need to know what the situation is. We were, indeed, able to
immediately take this off ZyLAB, but this is a new version of
D157.13, apparently recently translated, which, of course, begs
the question why the translators were now able to translate and
weren't before.
But that's another issue.
But I think I'm raising this point now to ask clarification as to
what happened with this specific document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The <International> Deputy Co-Prosecutor, you have the floor.
MR. LYSAK:
I think that's a question he should direct to CMS. This -- I
mean, he wasted I don't know how much time because he had an old
version before the English translation had been posted. I can't
answer why someone from CMS thought this document was illegible.
The French translation has clearly been on the Case file for a
while. You can tell, well, you can tell from the document numbers
when, roughly, when these documents were posted. But this is a
question he can raise with the translators. And sometimes, my
understanding is, translators are sent a copy that is not a good
copy and they're able to go back and get a better copy. But I'm
not the right person to answer this question. You can correspond
with CMS. All I can tell you is that this document has been in
ZyLAB for a long time, since I started preparing for this witness
weeks ago. That's all I can tell you.
MR. KOPPE:
I understand what the prosecutor is saying, but if we do not get
notified of an English translation then of course we're working
on the assumption that this document is unintelligible. Maybe
it's translated from the French version, I don't know. But,
again, we're not quite sure what's going on with these documents,
but I think we need clarification.
MR. LYSAK:
And just one more point, that's what the interface is for. We
posted this document on the interface. If you looked at the
interface and linked -- clicked on this document, you would have
got it. No, you would not have got it if you looked on the
interface, I guarantee you.
(Judges deliberate)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for raising this matter. The Chamber thinks it is
appropriate for Counsel Koppe to make a request to ITU for
clarification since you are the one who <frequently raised> this
issue <regarding documents, which was faced by the Lead
Co-Lawyers>, so that ITU can clarify this matter once and for
all.
The hearing today comes to its adjournment, and we will resume
tomorrow -- that is, Wednesday,
March 2015, commencing from 9           18   o'clock in the morning.
Tomorrow, the Chamber will continue to hear the remainder of the
testimony of this witness, Mr. Riel Son. This information is for
the concerned Parties and for the public <and please be on time>.

not yet concluded. Thus, you are invited by the Chamber to return
tomorrow starting from 9 o'clock in the morning. You may now
