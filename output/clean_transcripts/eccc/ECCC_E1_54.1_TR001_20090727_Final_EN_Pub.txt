(Judges enter courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated.  The Court is now in session.
We are going to continue hearing the testimony of witness Kok
Sros.
Before we begin our proceedings, the Greffiers are now instructed
to verify the attendance of the parties to the proceedings and
the person concerned today.
THE GREFFIER:
Mr. President, the parties to the proceedings today are all
present.  The witness, Kok Sros, is also present in the
courtroom.  Witness KW-07 is ready to be testifying in the Court
and he has no relationship with any parties in the proceeding and
he has taken an oath already.
THE PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Kok Sros.  Today, the Chamber is going to hear
your testimony.
Before we give this floor to the Judges to put questions to you,
could you please be informed of your rights and obligations as a
witness as following.
As a witness, you can reject to respond to any questions if you
are afraid that your testimony could self-incriminate you and, as
a witness, you have the obligation to tell the Court only the
truth; nothing but the truth.  So, please, be reminded we already
informed you during the first day you came to the courtroom.
And, next, we would like to give the floor to Judge Thou Mony to
put further questions to Mr. Kok Sros.  The floor is yours, Judge
Thou Mony.
JUDGE THOU MONY:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY JUDGE THOU MONY:
Q. Mr. Kok Sros, in the afternoon of Wednesday, we already put a
couple of questions to you but we would like to proceed with
further questions.
As the guard, had you ever carried out the arrests?
A. No, I had never arrested people.
Q. You said that you were on guard at the building, which is the
south-north building, probably Building D.  During the time when
you were on guard, were you supposed to be on guard or you took
shifts also to different places?
A. I was in charge of guarding inside the complex.  After one
month I was shifted to guard outside, so this was a regular basis
that I once guarded inside and once guarded outside after each
month.
Q. So you had to guard different places.  Is that correct?
A. There were two locations that I had to stand guard, inside and
outside, so these two locations are my primary target for my
assignment.
Q. When you were guarding inside, what had you seen?
A. I had to patrol the location to see prisoners, and I observed
that some prisoners were covered with injuries on their backs
when they were walking -- passing me when I were on guard.
Q. So you were walking while on duty.  Could you tell the Court
what was your impression concerning the detainees, and how were
they treated?
A. Detainees were put in an individual cell and there were a six
centimetres-long metal bar attached to shackles and they were
shackled, and every one of detainees was shackled in each
individual cell.
Q. Were detainees shackled on a regular basis or sometimes they
were also removed from being shackled?
A. Detainees were shackled every day and night.
Q. If they were shackled regularly like that, how could they have
themselves washed or relieve themselves?
A. They were given a container or box to relieve themselves and
while -- when they had to be washed then water would be sprayed
from a hose; water hose from outside.
Q. How could detainees change their clothes?  Were they wet and
then they had to keep it until it dried?  What happened?
A. During the time when they were being washed, they could change
their clothes and then had the wet one dried.
Q. How could they change or remove their clothes if they were
remained shackled?
A. They could make use of the one leg which was not attached to
the shackles.  Then they could remove their pants or shorts
through that kind of margins of the shackles.
Q. Were there any female detainees at the location where you were
on guard?
A. No, there weren't.
Q. So did you know anything about the situation when female
detainees were being washed?
A. I never saw any female detainees had a wash inside individual
cells.
Q. What about the food ration?  Was detainees given enough food?
A. Detainees did not receive adequate food ration because they
were given only a small mug of gruel and just watery soup.
Q. So how could the food be delivered to them?
A. Normally, the mug would be used to take the gruel, so they
were given only one mug of gruel.
Q. You said you saw prisoners or detainees who had scars or
injuries on their back and body.  From your observation, did you
notice that these detainees were severely injured and how could
they sustain such wounds?
A. I have no idea how they were treated, but when I saw them I
noted that they would have been beaten and the wounds were
obviously seen on their backs, and I don't know how they were
tortured.
Q. Did you know back then that the detainees would be immersed
into the water basin and that their toenails or nails were torn
off?
A. I don't know.
Q. At the location where you were assigned to guard, were there
any interrogation sessions or places?
A. I did not see any interrogation locations in that compound.
Q. So where were these detainees taken to be interrogated then?
A. They were taken to the east of the compound.
Q. Within the vicinity of the prison or outside?
A. Outside.
Q. When detainees were taken to be interrogated, who were in
charge of walking them; the guards or the interrogators who were
assigned to do those tasks?
A. The interrogators were in charge.  The guards were asked to
unlocked the door and take the detainees but, later on, the
interrogators would be walking them.
Q. So you said about the mobile forces and then the fixed forces;
could you tell us more about this?
A. Yes, there were mobile guards and fixed guards.
Q. Did you ever witness any interrogation session?
A. No, I didn't.
Q. While on duty, what kind of regulations and rules were imposed
on you and other guards?  So if you made any mistake by letting
any detainee escape, for example, what would be the sanction or
punishment?
A. During the meeting, the superior would instruct us to be
vigilant, to be very careful while on guard and not to allow
detainees to react against any of the guards and not to let
anyone flee, otherwise we would be punished.
Q. So who led the meeting?
A. Peng, the chief of the unit of 100.
Q. Did Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, ever chair the meeting?
A. He never attended such meeting except Peng who was seen often.
Q. During the time when you were on guard, did you see or had you
seen Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, walk past that location?
A. Occasionally, he would come to that location, but he did not
come inside, he only watch from outside.
Q. Had you ever seen him interrogating any detainee?
A. No, I had not seen him interrogating any detainees.
Q. Did you also know that the accused took part in interrogating
the detainees?
A. I don't think I know anything about this.
Q. In the process of detaining the detainees and taking the
detainees out to be interrogated, who ordered such a process to
be done?
A. It was the unit of 100 which was in charge of bringing and
taking out the detainees.
Q. So who was superior than the unit of 100 regarding this
matter?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you know that after each interrogation, were there any
detainees released after such interrogation sessions?
A. I don't know.
Q. Where would the detainees who had been interrogated taken to?
A. I don't know where they were taken to, but they left the rooms
or the cell and disappeared.
Q. How were they transported?  Could you please tell the Court
about the process of any detainee being transported?
A. Detainees would be tied to -- their hands behind their back
and blindfolded.
Q. Had you ever witnessed any execution of any detainee inside
S-21 compound?
A. I never saw it.
Q. When detainees were wounded -- the injuries sustained from the
interrogation and torture -- were there any treatment for them?
A. There were medics.
Q. How many medics were there at S-21?
A. I don't know.
Q. You indicated that the wounded detainees would be treated by
medics.  Did you ever see the medics give such treatment?  Was
the treatment taking place inside the compound or were they
treated elsewhere?
A. The medics treated the detainees inside the cells.
Q. How many medics were seen at any one time, and were there any
female medics?
A. I saw only one male medic.
Q. Among the superiors at S-21, other than Mr. Kaing Guek Eav
alias Duch and Peng, the chief of the unit of 100, do you know
any other people?
A. I have known four guards: Kuarn, Heng, Than, and a guy named
Choeun -- the four guards I have known and they survived.
Q. I would like to know the superiors -- I mean people in the
leadership at S-21 -- for example, the chief of the interrogators
or the chief of any units inside S-21.  Do you know any of them?
A. I only know Brother Hor and Brother Huy and Brother Peng and
small Huy.
Q. What is the full name of small Huy?
A. His name is Him Huy.
Q. What about the big Huy?  What is his full name?
A. I don't know his full name.  I only known his appearance; I
saw him.
Q. During the time when you had worked at S-21, had you ever seen
any staff member of S-21 be arrested?
A. I never witnessed even the disappearance of the staff member
at S-21.
Q. You never witnessed this disappearance, but did you ever see
any arrest of the members of staff at S-21?
A. At S-21, from what I observed within my group, two were
arrested -- the chief and a member of the group.
Q. What offence did they make so that they were arrested?
A. It's my observation that they did not complete their task
properly as they fell asleep during the guard shift, so they were
arrested.
Q. Did you know after they were arrested where were they taken
to?
A. I did not know.
Q. Did you know about the arrest and the killing of westerners;
did you witness that?
A. I did not see it.
Q. During the time that you worked at S-21, were you permitted to
visit your relatives or to go visit your home village?
A. No.
Q. So you worked at S-21, and until when did you stop?
A. I worked at S-21 until the time almost near the liberation
when I moved to the rice field.
Q. How did you move to the rice field?  Did you go and work in a
rice field or you made a mistake and you were sent for
re-education?
A. I did not make any mistake but I was assigned in amongst other
people because the work was light, so we were assigned to assist
in rice farming at the rice fields.
Q. During the time that you went to do farming, did you go every
year?
A. From the time that I worked at S-21, I was assigned to work in
the rice fields on two occasions.
Q. Did you know before the liberation of 7 January that prisoners
were transported to any location in large scale?
A. I did not know about that.
Q. Did you know the location of Choeung Ek?
A. I hear people talking about Choeung Ek, but I myself did not
go there.
Q. So you heard people talking about Choeung Ek.  What did they
talk about at Choeung Ek or were prisoners from S-21 were taken
and killed at Choeung Ek?  Did you know that?
A. Regarding the prisoners being taken and killed at Choeung Ek,
I did not know that.  I only heard people talking about Choeung
Ek, and whether prisoners were transported to that location I did
not know.
JUDGE THOU MONY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I do not have more questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judges of the Bench, do you have any questions to be put to the
witness?
Judge Cartwright, you take the floor.
JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:
Kok Sros, you spoke to the author of a book called "Voices from
S-21"and the author's name was David Chandler.  Do you remember
doing that?
A. It's been so many years, I cannot recall it.
Q. Well, I have a few questions to ask you about an interview
that you gave to David Chandler, and you can tell me at any time
if you don't agree with some of the statements that you gave to
him.  But, first, do you remember meeting a man called David
Chandler?
A. I met a person but I cannot recall his name.
Q. This would be a man who spoke English and it would have been
nearly 10 years ago, so does that help you?
A. That is correct.
Q. Thank you.  Now, first of all, the book to which I am
referring is "Voices From S-21:  Terror and History in Pol Pot's
Secret prison" and it's found at English ERN 00192667 to 00192932
D91/I.
First of all, at ERN 00192712, you talked to this man about the
age of the guards at S-21.  Is it correct what you said to him,
that you were 25 years of age when you came to S-21, but that
most of the guards who began working after the middle of 1977
were quite a lot younger than that?  Is that correct, to your
recollection?
A. I cannot recall that part.  I totally forget.
Q. Do you remember anything about the age of the guards at S-21?
Were they the same age as you or were they younger?
A. From my observation, there were some guards who were older and
younger than me.
Q. Are you able to tell me how young the youngest guards would
be?  Would they be 20 years of age or younger?
A. The children who stayed and worked with me, their ages were
around 15 years old.
Q. And were there many children of that age working at S-21?
A. There were only a few of them working at S-21, and there were
about three of them working within my group.
Q. Thank you.  And there could have been other children of that
age in other groups but you might not know about that.  Is that
correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Now, in his book, this man also talks about how he spoke to
you about high-ranking prisoners at S-21, and he says that you
told him that they got special treatment.  Do you remember that?
A. I cannot recall this part.
Q. At English ERN 00192716, he says that you told him that they
slept on beds and had the same food as the staff.  Do you
remember that?
A. I cannot recall this part either.  It's been so many years
already, I have forgotten it.
Q. Do you remember telling him that after they had been
interrogated and tortured they were bathed and the medics treated
them?  Do you remember that?
A. I can't recall this part.
Q. And is that correct, what you told him?
A. That was what I said to him.
Q. Now, you spent a lot of time at S-21 and you were able to
watch a lot of things happening.  Is that correct?
A. I have forgotten most of them already, it's been so long.
Q. Well, I certainly understand that, but I still have a few more
matters that I'd like to ask you about because of what you told
this man, David Chandler.
The next thing is at ERN 00192775, and David Chandler says that
you told him that you saw prisoners who were often covered in
blood when they were taken back to their cells after
interrogation.  Is that a correct statement?
A. That is correct.
Q. And again at 00192821, you spoke of hearing people screaming
during interrogation.  Is that correct?
A. That is correct too.
Q. And that you heard that screaming while they were under
interrogation, but also whenever a prisoner disobeyed a guard.
Is that correct?
A. I cannot recall that part.
Q. The screaming that you heard when people were being
interrogated, did you have to be quite close to the place where
they were being interrogated to hear it?
A. When I heard it, I guarded inside, but I was near the wall --
to the east part of the wall.  I did not see it, but I could hear
the screaming
Q. Another person told this man, David Chandler, that there was
lots of screaming, especially at night when there was no noise in
Phnom Penh and that, "the cries were so loud we could hear them
from half a mile away."  Do you agree with that statement?
A. I did not know about this statement.  I did not know about
this point either.
Q. Now, at 00192832, you talked to David Chandler about the
killings of prisoners and you told him that nearly all the
killings took place in secret and at night.  Is that as you
remember it now?
A. I completely forget this point.
Q. You told him that in 1976, blindfolded prisoners were clubbed
to death with iron bars in the field immediately to the west of
the compound.  They were buried where they fell in shallow graves
that measured only 1.5 metres deep.  Do you remember those
incidents?
A. I cannot recall this part either.
Q. You also told him that although the killings were not openly
discussed, the smell of decomposing bodies mingled with the
stench of feces and urine was overwhelming.  Do you remember
this?
A. I am not really clear on my recollection of this part.
Q. At ERN 00192845, you spoke to David Chandler about
interrogators who did not want to use torture and that if they
hesitated, they would be arrested.  Do you remember that?
A. I also forget this point.  I cannot recall it.
Q. Do you remember attending a livelihood meeting where the
accused spoke about torture saying something like this?
"You must rid yourselves of the view that beating prisoners is
cruel.  Kindness is misplaced in such cases.  You must speak to
them for national reasons, class reasons, and international
reasons."
Do you remember any livelihood meetings where the accused said
words like that?
A. During the meeting, the superior would give us instructions to
the guards to perform their duty properly, not to allow the
prisoners to conduct any activities and besides that, I cannot
recall anything.
Q. Do you remember the accused, Duch, talking to a livelihood
meeting about how you should beat prisoners?
A. I did not know this part.
Q. Thank you.
JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:
Mr. President, I have no further questions of this witness, but
with your permission, may I ask the accused about that last
statement, please?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Cartwright, you can proceed.
JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:
Thank you.
Kaing Guek Eav, do you wish me to repeat the statement that is
recorded in David Chandler's book that I just read out to this
witness?
THE ACCUSED:
Your Honour, the book by David Chandler is also in French and I
read it, but I cannot recall it and if you can now read what you
said then I would thank you.
JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:
This is a statement attributed to you and recorded as coming from
an un-catalogued item from S-21 archive dated 18 February 1976,
so I don't have an ERN Number for that but I will read it out to
you in English again.  This is the statement that was recorded:
"You must rid yourselves of the view that beating the prisoners
is cruel.  Kindness is misplaced in such cases.  You must beat
them for national reasons, class reasons, and international
reasons."
Now, my question to you, obviously, is do you accept that you
made a statement like that?
THE ACCUSED:
Your Honour, the document of the 18th of 1976 that you just read
was far from what I taught.  The content of what I taught, I
believe, is on the record of the 13 February 1976 which during
the livelihood meeting, I led the meeting for the city resistance
force -- the former force.  I said anyone who was arrested by
Angkar was the enemy and if you cannot regard them as an enemy
then you cannot extract the confession from them, and that is the
foundation for my instructions to every interrogator, but on the
cruel beating, it's not.  And, of course, for the reasons of the
nation, the class, it is a possibility that I might have said to
distinguish their individualism and nation.
And the focus is that the people who were arrested and sent to
S-21, they did not have any issues with anyone working at S-21 or
with me, but they were arrested by Angkar, and I believe I did
not say anything in regard cruel beating.  That is my response,
Your Honour.
JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:
Thank you.  We will, of course, be examining Professor Chandler
later, but your response to his entire book has been that it is a
thorough and systematic review of events at S-21.  Is that
correct?
THE ACCUSED:
Your Honour, I responded to David Chandler in 13-page writing in
French language, which I already submitted to the
Co-Investigating Judges, and I will respond more when David
Chandler is summonsed to testify in the Chamber.
JUDGE CARTWRIGHT:
Yes, thank you.
I have no further questions of the accused.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Lavergne, you take the floor.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.
BY JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Q. Mr. Kok Sros, I am Judge Lavergne and I have a few questions
to put to you.
Could you first of all tell me if you are suffering from memory
problems?  Do you have difficulty to remember certain things?
A. Because the events took place long time ago, so I cannot
recall them all clearly.
Q. Do you not remember specifically what happened at S-21 or,
generally speaking, you have memory problems?  Or are these
problems only based on your recollections of S-21 -- only involve
your recollections of S-21?
A. I know that I forget a lot because I think a lot and my main
focus at the moment is to provide support to my family.
Q. You have seen the accused present here in the courtroom.  Do
you recognize him?  Do you wish to see him again?
A. I recognize him here in the courtroom; he was the Chairman of
S-21.  At that time, I called him Ta Duch, or Grandfather Duch.
Q. Was he also called Brother East?
A. I had never heard he was called like that.
Q. You were interviewed by the investigators of the
Co-Investigating Judges, this is in document number D78/10 and
you explained, amongst other things, that after Phnom Penh was
evacuated you worked in what you described as the main prison.
You have so far not mentioned this work at the main prison.  Do
you remember it or not?
A. I think my memory is rather poor regarding that point.  I
don't remember it in details.
Q. Are your memory problems recent because you were interviewed
barely more than a year ago?  It was on the 3rd of April 2008.
Your memory was good on the 3rd of April 2008 and it is no longer
good now.  Is that correct?  Did you have any particular problems
after the 3rd of April 2008?
A. Of course, my memory after the 3rd of April 2008 is still
good, but still I forget a lot of other things because I have not
paid great attention to that matter other than my feeding of the
family.
Q. Mr. Kok Sros, are you afraid today, and if you are afraid,
what are you afraid of or whom are you afraid of?
A. No, Your Honour, I'm not afraid of what or whom.
Q. So the most important thing for you today is to feed your
family.  Is that what we are to understand?
A. That is correct, Your Honour.
Q. But do you know that as a witness you took an oath and you are
required to participate in the ascertainment of the truth?  Are
you aware of this?
A. Yes, I am, Your Honour.  Only if I can recollect it then I am
able to tell the Court and the parts that I'm not sure I'm not
supposed to tell the Court because I don't remember it.
Q. At this particular moment, do you remember what you described
as the main prison PJ which was south of the central market Psar
Thmei?  Do you remember telling the investigators that Duch was
the director of that prison?
A. I spent only one night and one day at that location before I
was transferred to Ta Khmau and the person in charge at that time
was told by my friends that he was Ta Duch.  That's what I was
told.
Q. Did you see him there or is this something which, as you say,
you were told?  And what was going on in that prison?
A. I did not see him in that location.  I was only told about
him.
Q. Had you heard about him before then?
A. No, I hadn't.
Q. You explained that afterwards you went to Ta Khmau prison and
you stated that the prisoners in Ta Khmau were sent to the
central prison to be interrogated.  Did you witness this
personally or was this something you were told?
A. I was told about this.
Q. Mr. Kok Sros, was it the first time you were working in a
detention centre?  In the course of your life had you ever had to
work in a detention centre before?
A. No, Your Honour, only during the Khmer Rouge regime that I had
been put and appointed by the Angkar to work in that such
location.
Q. Was this ordinary work, in your view, or was it special work?
Did it leave strong memories for you or did it seem something
ordinary?
A. Through my observation, this work was a kind of ordinary task.
Q. Could you explain what was ordinary about this work?
A. I'm saying it is ordinary work because wherever I had worked,
it would be the same and when I worked at the prison I could feel
like it was just another kind of ordinary assignment because we
were assigned by the Angkar to be on guard and we had to follow
the assignment, the order.
Q. Mr. Kok Sros, today if you were asked to do such ordinary
work, if you were asked to do that again, would you do it?
A. No, Your Honour, I wouldn't.
Q. The shouting, the shouting you heard, was that ordinary?  Was
that normal?  Were these human beings shouting or were they the
cries of animals?
A. The shouting's from people were of course different from the
cries of the animals.
Q. Regarding the wounds that you saw, the bodies covered in blood
-- were they the bodies of human beings?  The smells, what was it
that smelled?
A. The wounded detainees were physically human beings but the
smell I did not know whether they smelled like animal or what.  I
just have no idea.
Q. Do you remember that smell now?  What did it smell of?  Was it
the smell of dead bodies as you were told a while ago?  What was
it?  What smell was this?
A. At that time I could smell the stench.  I think the smell was
identical to the smell from the decayed animal and dead animal,
dead body or the human corpses.  They were the same.
Q. Is Angkar a word that raises any memories with you; what does
it mean to you?  What memories does it arouse; is it something
ordinary or does it arouse fear within you?
A. Usually the term Angkar, so far as I know, is just the
ordinary term used back then.  I have not been afraid of using
the term Angkar because it has been widely used.
Q. And the word "pity", was that word ever used in S-21?  Do you
remember any prisoners who asked you to help them?  Do you have
any such memories?
A. At S-21 I had never heard the term "pity" -- never.
Q. Do you remember prisoners who asked you for help, who asked
you, "Why am I detained?"  Does this remind you of anything?  Did
you speak to the prisoners or did you not speak to them at all?
A. When detainees were arrested and detained in the cells, of
course, they asked me and the guards such questions, why were
they arrested and detained.  I just told them I did not know
anything.  It was the Angkor who arrested them and sent them here
and I was in charge of looking -- or just patrolling the
location.  That's all.
Q. Did they ask you for help?  When there was suffering, did they
ask you for help?
A. They did ask me for help, but I just told them that I could
not help them.  It was none of my business.
Q. So that is ordinary work?  It is neither a good or a bad
memory; it is just an ordinary memory for you, is it?
A. I partially remember the work.  I cannot fully remember the
details because many years had passed.
Q. And in the course of this work, do you remember any prisoners
who committed suicide?
A. I don't know.  I had never seen such incident.
Q. Did you hear about it?  Did you have any instructions destined
to avoid detainees committing suicide?
A. It's obviously true that we were instructed to be cautious of
this matter.
Q. Did you see anyone die at S-21?
A. No, I didn't, Your Honour.
Q. Did you hear about any female prisoners who may have been
maltreated or even raped?  Did you have any instructions
regarding female prisoners?
A. I was not in charge of guarding the female detainees, and I
don't even know where they would have been detained.
Q. I shall put my question again.  Did you hear about any
prisoners, any female prisoners, being raped; did you hear
anything about it?
A. No, I didn't, Your Honour.
Q. Now, let us talk about the accused.  In your view, was he an
ordinary leader?  What can you tell us about Duch; what can you
tell us about his character?
A. Having lived and worked with him, I think he led the work
ordinarily and he did not force us to do anything.
Q. What does that mean; what does what you have just told us
mean?
A. It was ordinary because we were assigned the same old tasks
and that we followed the orders on a regular basis without any
problem.
Q. When you were interviewed by the investigators, and I am
referring to document number D78/10 pages 3 and 4 of the French,
the following question was put to you:
"For how long have you known Duch; what is he like?"
And you said this:
"He is small.  He is warm but strict.  I knew him from when I
was assigned to be a guard in S-21.  I went once to Duch's when I
took prisoners who were able to record documents at his home.
His home was in front of the entry gate to the southeast.  Duch
spoke with me and asked me to keep the prisoners, to guard the
good prisoners -- or the prisoners who were good at registering
documents.  Duch was the Director of S-21 and he was responsible
for documents pertaining to confessions.  He kept orders in
general; for example, with regard to executions."
So what are you telling us today?  Are you telling us that he was
a warm but strict person still?  Was he an ordinary man?
A. It is correct as what I already stated in that quote Your
Honour just read out.
Q. You spent practically four years in S-21, didn't you?  Would
you say that these memories are painful or that they are
ordinary; that is, neither good nor bad?
A. I had been in S-21 from 1975 until the liberation day of the
7th of January.  I had been suffering, of course, from the time I
spent there but I had no choice.  I could not flee and I just had
to be patient and I did not even realize that the regime had
exterminated a large scale of population, and I just did my best
to survive.
Q. So let me try to summarize.  If you have any bad memories it
is because you personally suffered.  Is that correct?  Or do you
also have bad memories because other people suffered in S-21, or
is this suffering too ordinary?
A. The suffering endured at S-21 was tremendous because we had to
work hard.  Every one of us suffered and we had no choice, we
could not escape, and we had to work.  Only time would tell.
Q. This will be my last question, Mr. Kok Sros.
The hardest suffering; was it you who suffered, was it the staff
that suffered or was it the prisoners?
A. The detainees suffered more than the staff members at S-21.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Very well, I have no further questions, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is a convenient time now to take an adjournment.  We will
adjourn for 17 minutes and resume afterwards.
The Court officer is now instructed to take Kok Sros to the
waiting room and return him to the courtroom by a quarter to 11
a.m.
(Judges exit courtroom)
(Court recesses from 1029H to 1050H)
(Judges enter courtroom)
MR PRESIDENT:
Please be seated.  The Chamber is now back in session.  We
continue to hear the testimony of the witness, Kok Sros.
Before I hand the floor to the Co-Prosecutors, the Chamber would
like to make an announcement regarding the decision and
instructions as a result of our Trial Management Meeting and also
in response to the various requests.
First, regarding the request for the time to question the
witnesses.  On the 22nd of July, the Co-Prosecutors raised
questions to the accused regarding the time of the testimony of
the witness.  It is requested that this type of practice would
scare the witnesses away.
The Chamber also noticed that the civil party lawyers group
3   said if the accused was to be questioned during the testimony of
the accused; an extra time shall be given.
Regarding these two requests, the Chamber would like to provide
instructions to all parties as follows.
1. There is no restriction on the questioning of the accused
during the relevant time of the proceedings.  The Chamber will
make decision whether the questioning is allowed or not based on
the actual situation.
2. All the civil parties can use all the times allocated for
questioning to the witness and instead question the accused,
however, there is no additional time granted for such
questioning.
The civil party lawyers group 2 also requested to ask questions
-- or the remaining questions to the accused -- but as the lawyer
did not have time to ask during the allocated time.  The
Co-Prosecutors supported this motion but observed that if the
Chamber takes this stand then the questions shall be divided
verbally in order to set the times required for translation in
the three languages.
The defence counsel objected to this request with the reasons
that this is a simple proceeding to gain additional time for the
civil party lawyers to put questions.
Decision:  The Chamber has the duty to ensure that the trial is
both fair and expeditious.  There is a constant need to review
the time given to parties to put questions while ensuring that
the defence also has adequate time.
The Trial Chamber will not introduce a practice that effectively
extends the time for questioning allocated to any party as this
would distort the careful balancing of the time allocated to each
party, including the defence.
Decision on the request by the defence for a period of time equal
to the time allocated to the prosecutors and the civil parties
together for putting questions to the witnesses:  The Chamber has
noted the defence application to be granted after each witness
testifies, a period of time equal to the total questioning time
granted to the Co-Prosecutors and civil party lawyers.
Bearing in mind that the civil parties are allowed to put their
questions with a view to supporting the prosecution, the Chamber
is aware that in order to preserve the rights of the defence
particularly the right to a fair trial that guarantees equality
of arms, it may become necessary to accord more time to the
defence than is set aside for it in the scheduling of the
hearing.  This notwithstanding, the Chamber must also ensure that
the trial of the accused is conducted within a reasonable time,
which justifies the view that for the proper administration of
justice a limited time should be allocated to each of the parties
to take the floor during the proceedings and that repetitive or
irrelevant questions should be prohibited.
The Chamber notes that in point of fact the defence has so far
not requested additional time, nor has the defence registered any
particular concerns upon the conclusion of a testimony.  On the
contrary, the defence has most often signified that it has no
further questions, even when the time allocated for it to put
questions still runs.
Accordingly, the Chamber is of the opinion that in order to allow
for realistic scheduling consistent with expeditious trial
requirements, it is appropriate to maintain the time allocated
for each party to take the floor; it being clear that should the
Chamber consider it necessary, in light of the questions already
put, the defence may apply to the Chamber for a further period of
time to enable it to put all the questions it may consider
necessary to ensure that its rights are preserved.  In such case
the Chamber will rule on a case-by-case basis.
The Chamber decides to maintain the period of time currently
allocated to the defence; it being clear that the defence may on
a case-by-case basis and, in light of what transpires in the
proceedings, request a further period of time to put the
questions that it considers necessary for the preservation of its
rights.
These are the instructions and decisions regarding the motions
and observations put forward by the parties during the last
hearing on last Wednesday.  I would like now to give the floor to
the Co-Prosecutors to put questions to this witness regarding the
facts being processed before the Chamber.
The Co-Prosecutors have 15 minutes in total.  The floor is yours.
MR. TAN SENARONG:
Thank you, Mr. President.
QUESTIONING BY THE CO-PROSECUTORS
BY MR. TAN SENARONG:
Q. Good morning, Mr. Kok Sros.  The first question:  you stated
earlier on that you were assigned to guard S-21 and you took
turns to stand guard one month inside the compound and the other
month would be standing guard outside.  So who made such decision
to switch your shift and how many hours were you supposed to be
on guard?
A. It was the chief of the company who administered these shifts.
If the shift falls on the evening we would be on guard from 6
p.m. to 12 midnight.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Kok Sros.  During the time when you were on
guard, both within and outside the vicinity of S-21, when you
were guarding had you ever seen any security regulations in each
building?
MR. TAN SENARONG:
With the Chamber's permit, could the document with ERN 00181448
be put on the screen, please?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The AV Unit is instructed to project this document as requested.
BY MR. TAN SENARONG:
Q. Mr. Kok Sros, have you ever seen such Santebal circulations
while you were at S 21?
A. I had never seen such regulations.
Q. Thank you.
MR. TAN SENARONG:
With Mr. President's leave could another photo, the general view
with ERN 00189137, be put on display, please?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The AV Unit is instructed to put this document on the screen as
requested by the Co-Prosecutor.
BY MR. TAN SENARONG:
Q. Mr. Kok Sros, this is the overview, the photo or aerial
photograph of S-21, and you can see letters here -- letters A, B,
C, D, and E.  Can you please tell the Chamber, during the time
when you were guarding the premises, in which particular building
did you witness the detainees being detained, and in which
particular location of which particular building were you on
guard?
MR. TAN SENARONG:
And I would like to inform the Chamber that this is just the
former photographs already included in the case file.  We only
highlighted and added just a few names of the streets to be more
convenient for the witness to identify.
BY MR. TAN SENARONG:
Q. Mr. Kok Sros, could you please tell the Court about this?
A. I was guarding at Building C inside the building and then when
I was guarding outside, it was to the west at the rear of
Building C and I would be patrolling along the wall of that
premise.
MR. TAN SENARONG:
Thank you.
With Mr. President's leave, could document with ERN 00326351 be
put on display?  This photo was the drawing of Vann Nath who
depicts the condition of S-21.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The AV Unit is instructed to put this document under ERN 00326351
on the screen, please.
BY MR. TAN SENARONG:
Q. Mr.  Kok Sros, as a guard, had you ever seen any detainee were
detained in such a condition as shown in this photo or as this
drawing?
A. The drawings are reflecting the real condition at the location
back then.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Kok Sros.
MR. TAN SENARONG:
Could document P00000027 be put on the screen, please, with Mr.
President's leave?
Q. In this common room and you could see that detainees were
shackled and lie down on their backs, does it remind you of the
condition back then when you were on guard?  Did you see such
condition?
A. That is true, the condition is like that.
Q. Thank you very much.
MR. TAN SENARONG:
I would like to give the floor to my colleague to put more
questions.
MR. AHMED:
Given the constraints of time, I'll have a very few questions.
Can I request the Audio-Visual Unit to project this document on
the screen, 00186795 to 00186801?  And while it's being
projected, I shall ask my question.
BY MR. AHMED:
Q. Mr. Kok Sros, you are a literate person and you can read
Khmer, can't you?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The AV Unit is now instructed to put this document on the screen
as requested by the international Co-Prosecutor.
BY MR. AHMED:
Q. I'll ask my question again.  Mr. Kok Sros, you are a literate
person and you can read Khmer, can't you?
A. Yes, I can read, but now my eyesight is not good because I
cannot really see the clear cut of the writings.
Q. This document before you is a statement that you gave about
one year ago as reminded to you by Judge Lavergne on which there
is a signature and a time impression.  On the left-hand side, can
you recognize your signature and time impression?
A. I still remember it.
Q. This was a statement you gave to the investigators of the
Investigating Judges who interviewed you on 3rd April 2008.  You
told the investigators that Duch, the accused here, was in
overall control of the premises and he had the power including
the order to kill.  Do you agree with that?
A. Yes, I do because at that location he was the top person.
Q. You also told the investigators that when Vietnamese soldiers
came in, Duch ordered the killing of the remaining detainees at
S-21.  Is that correct?
A. No one other than him could put such order; otherwise the
detainee would not be executed.
Q. Thank you.
You also told the investigators that although children were not
detained, but children of "big guys" and this is not my
expression, your expression, "big guys" -- were detained; is that
true?
A. I did not mention anything about it.
Q. You also told the investigators that sometimes senior military
officials were imprisoned and with them, their soldiers -- their
entire group was arrested even if they were innocent soldiers.
Do you agree?
A. I don't remember saying it.
Q. You also told the investigators that important prisoners, even
if they were few in number, were killed outside the S-21 fence.
Do you agree with that?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. You also told the investigators of the Investigating Judges
that there were many foreigners -- Indians, Thais, and
particularly Vietnamese who were there at S-21.  Is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. My last question to you is, because my time is running out --
you quoted Duch as saying that Duch ordered the imprisonment of
S-21 staff -- not quoting Duch, this is your statement:
"Duch ordered the imprisonment of S-21 staff if they had
involvements and tendencies."
To your recollection, did Duch order the imprisonment of S-21
staff?
A. I still remember it.
Q. Maybe one last question since I have one minute.  You said:
"No inmate was allowed to leave alive from S-21."
Is that correct?
A. Yes, that is correct.
MR. AHMED:
Mr. President, I have no further questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Next, at this time, for the civil party lawyers to put questions
to the witness starting from civil party lawyer, group 1.  You
have five minutes to put question to this witness.
MR. WERNER:
Good morning, Your Honours.
We have an agreement among civil parties because of the time
allocated.  Only one lawyer will ask questions to the civil
party; and it will be for this witness my colleague, Silke
Studzinsky.
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Lawyer Studzinsky, please take the floor, but could you please
verify the time.  It is now 11.14.
MS. STUDZINSKY:
Yes, good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I agree it's
between 11.14 and 11.15.
QUESTIONING BY CIVIL PARTY COUNSEL
BY MS. STUDZINSKY:
Q. Good morning, Mr. Kok Sros.  My name is Silke Studzinsky.  I'm
representing civil
party for victims here in these proceedings.  I want to put some
questions to you.
My first question is did you see the accused enter the
interrogation rooms outside the prison compound to watch and
inspect interrogations?
A. I saw him once.  He came into the place where the
interrogators were conducting interrogation.  I did not know what
he said or what he did inside.
Q. Do you remember how long he stayed in this interrogation room?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you remember what kind of prisoner was interrogated?  Was
this an important prisoner?
A. When he came to that session I didn't know whether the
detainee at that time was important or not important.
Q. What was the distance?  Where were you when you saw him enter
this room?
A. It was about 15 metres from the location where I was standing
and I could see him walking from the east into that location.
Q. Did you see that the accused frequently came to inspect the
detention cells, looking in from outside? Did you observe this?
A. Occasionally he would be coming to the location but he was not
coming inside the compound.  He was seen outside.
Q. But again, am I right that he looked into the cells, into the
detention cells, and this frequently?  Is this right?
A. Not very frequent.  He only went occasionally but he did not
go inside.  He only watched from outside.
Q. My next questions concern the suicides in S-21.  You told us
today that you have no knowledge about the suicides.  I would
like to confront you with a statement that you gave to David
Chandler, the man that already Judge Cartwright talked to you,
who made an interview around
years ago.  And there this is the           10   ERN 00164564, the English version.
And there you said to Mr. Chandler there were many cases of
prisoners committing suicide this way and you had described
before how they committed suicide.  "And some of them hanged
themselves so we had to be right there, watch them finish
drinking ourselves.  This is why we had to be careful."
Do you remember that you told Mr. Chandler that you were aware of
a lot of cases of suicide?
A. I still remember it regarding the detainee who hanged himself.
At that time we were instructed to be more vigilant and were
asked not to let this kind of thing happen again.
Q. Did you see this prisoner hanging personally with your own
eyes?
A. I never saw it personally because we worked in the different
targets of assignment.
Q. But you have been told about this suicide.  Is this right?
A. Yes, it's correct because I was told and when we changed shift
and I was told by the previous guards about this.
Q. I would like to know now could you recall again how many
people were in your group?
A. There were four groups in my unit, the units who would take
turns to guard the location.  In each group there were 10 to 12
people.
Q. How many of this group of 10 to 12 people disappeared?
A. After some time more and more people disappeared but I don't
remember how many disappeared because when one disappeared then
another person would be called to substitute the missing or the
disappearing men.
Q. But can you confirm -- and only talking about your group; that
means those with whom you worked closely together -- is it right
to say that these, the members of your group were like your
brothers?  Is this fair to say?
A. In my group there were 10 of us and we had worked together for
quite some time and there were two of us who disappeared.
Q. I would like to confront you with another statement that you
gave in this interview around 10 years ago.  This is the ERN
number 00164580.  In there you have been asked by David Chandler
how many were in your group.  Your answer was, "First there were
20 men and all of them died except for two of us.  Then they were
replaced."  This is rather different than what you said now.  It
means to David Chandler you said the great majority of your group
disappeared and died.
Could you recall what the right number is?  How many of your
brothers in your group died and disappeared?
A. It was not true that there were 20 people in the unit because
there were about 200 people in total.  After time passed by then
more and more people disappeared but later on I only observed
that the people whom I had known, only two of them remained.
Q. This was not really an answer to my question but, however, I
will proceed then at this point.  Had you fear when you observed
that more and more people from your group disappeared?  Had you
personally fear?
A. I felt some fear actually and I knew that only time would tell
but I had to tell myself to be strong and then concentrated on my
work.
Q. And you could?  You were able to control yourself in such
manner that this fear, this original fear, disappeared then and
then to go ahead with your work?  Is this right that you were
able to suppress your fear?
A. That's correct.
Q. I would like to move now to 1979 and 1978, and I would first
like to know did you get any news by the end of 1978 or beginning
of 1979 that the Vietnamese will invade or are about to invade
Cambodia?  Did you get any news about this?
A. I did not receive any information regarding that matter.
Q. And I would like to confront you as well with your statement
in the interview 10 years ago.  It is 00164572.  To the same
question you told David Chandler, "About two weeks before a cadre
called a meeting and told us about this."  And "this" means the
Vietnamese invasion.
My question is do you recall this now, that there was a meeting
two weeks before?
A. At that time, yes, there were meetings amongst the company
members and then we were instructed to be really strict and to
save all the resources because we would not be certain whether we
would sleep in the house or sleep in the forest.
Q. When did you finally leave S-21 and when have you been there
for the last time?  But I'm talking of course '78, '79.
A. Before I left S-21, that is, before the liberation it was
about a fortnight before the liberation I left S-21 and went to
work at a branch of S-21 to work the rice fields.  It was south
of Prey Sar prison where I worked the rice fields.
Q. Did you go back to S-21?
A. In that final stage I did not return and after the Vietnamese
attack I was at the rice fields so we fled to the west.
Q. I would like to confront you as well with your statement to
David Chandler.  It's on the same page, same ERN number of
00164572.  And there you have been asked, "When you left, were
the Vietnamese already approaching?"
And then I quote your response was,
"When we were about to leave, they had already reached Chbar
Ampov Monivong Bridge."
Do you remember this? That you have been in S-21 when the
Vietnamese arrived at Monivong Bridge?
A. I cannot recall this part.
Q. I'm very sorry but this is, I would say, a very impressing
moment that the Vietnamese enter Phnom Penh and you want to -- or
pretending here that you do not remember this.  I note this.
I would like to continue with one more sentence.  Did you come
back, as you told Mr. Chandler, to collect important documents
that were kept in the wardrobe, managed to get about one-third of
the documents.  There were a lot.  Do you remember that you have
collected documents from S-21?
A. I did not return to S-21.  I did not even go to my house to
collect my clothes, let alone the documents.  I did not return.
Q. And now my last quotation with this interview to Mr. David
Chandler.  On the same page you have been asked, "Did you burn
the documents at the prison?"
And then your response as it is quoted here is,
"No.  We took them away and threw some of them upon the streets,
the documents from the wardrobe in S-21."
Do you remember now?
A. As I said, I did not return to collect any document so that
statement is not true.
MS. STUDZINSKY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The allocated time is running out and
so we have further questions but no time to ask them.
Thank you very much, Mr. Kok Sros.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would like now to give the floor to the defence counsel to put
questions to the witness.  If you have any, the floor is yours.
MR. KAR SAVUTH:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good
morning, ladies and gentlemen.
QUESTIONING BY DEFENCE COUNSEL
BY MR. KAR SAVUTH:
Q. Mr. Kok Sros, in the document ERN 00186796 D78/10 on the last
line you said:
"Angkar assigned me to the big prison, PJ, south of Psar Thmei.
I stayed there for one night and the leader there was Duch."
Did you know In Lorn, alias Nat, at the time?
A. I did not know him at the time.
Q. Thank you.  During the time that you stood guard at S-21 did
you ever see any Vietnamese prisoners of war or Vietnamese
prisoners?
A. During the time that I stood guard I only saw Vietnamese
civilians, not Vietnamese soldiers.
Q. So during the time that you guarded you did not see any
Vietnamese soldiers.  Now, another question.
You said you never saw Duch interrogate or torture or kill any
prisoner.  Is this correct?  Do you agree with this statement?
A. Yes.
Q. Thank you.  You said Duch ordered the execution.  Did you know
who ordered Duch to give those instructions?  Do you know?
A. I did not know regarding this matter.
Q. Thank you.  You worked as a guard at that location.  Did you
ever see any release of Thai people at S-21?
A. I did not see any.
Q. Thank you.  In your group who was your direct chief of the
group?
A. In my group I had a chief but I cannot recall his name.
Q. So you forget your chief group?  Another question.
So who was the chief of your group chief?  Can you recall the
name?
A. The person supervised my group chief was Peng.
Q. Thank you.  What was the role of your group chief?  Can you
elaborate?
A. The role of the group chief was during the guard he patrolled
the guards at the designated locations to ensure that they did
not fall asleep.
Q. Thank you.  What about the role of the supervisor or the chief
of your chief?  Do you know that?
A. The role of the chairman of the company was stationed opposite
the detention location to supervise the incoming and outgoing of
the prisoners for the interrogation.
Q. Thank you.  Did you also know the role of the S-21 Chairman;
that is, of Duch?  Because he, as you stated, went around looking
at various rooms; so what was the role of Duch?  Can you
elaborate?
A. Regarding his role in general, and it is not specific, nobody
ordered him because he was the top leader there.  So he went
around doing this or that, inspecting this or that.  That is his
exclusive role to supervise, to monitor.
MR. KAR SAVUTH:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I do not have questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber would like to give the time now to the accused to
make his observations regarding this witness testimony, if he
wishes to do so.  Secondly, the observations to be made by the
accused is for the entire Chamber to hear.  Especially it should
be addressed to the Judges of the Bench and try to avoid to
signify any pressure placing upon the witness.
You can take the floor.
THE ACCUSED:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to clarify certain
matters as follows.
This person, Kok Sros -- and I was interested in him since I
started reading David Chandler's book and I wanted to find out
who actually is Kok Sros.  And during this Chamber hearing I
tried to look and to recognize him but I couldn't think of him at
all, of any people working at S-21.  I still think I never met
him before.  That is point one.
And on point number two I would like to talk about Mr. Kok Sros'
testimony, which I do not agree.  Kok Sros said I looked at the
detention rooms occasionally.  It sounds plausible but I never
did that, and that is the reason of the testimony that led me to
believe that Kok Sros was not a member of S-21.
And the second point to prove that he was not a member of the
S-21, he said that I instructed and provided lessons to the
guards regarding the policy on the enemy.  Of course I taught the
guards regarding the general situation and also talked about the
enemy, based on documents provided by Angkar, but it was in
general.  And regarding the teaching of specific enemy detained
at S-21, that testimony is not true.
And the third point:  Kok Sros said I ordered the prisoners to
copy documents, so this is another reason that makes me believe
he is not a member of the S-21. At S-21 we had a photocopier,
that is one machine, and the other one is a stencil machine and
then a roller and they are the remnants of Division 703.  Before
I became the Chairman of S-21, 703 was already in operation of
the three machines.   Although I have the three machines in my
house, as ordered by my superior, only where needed, I ordered
the S-21 staff to use it.  Therefore, I am not convinced that Kok
Sros was a former guard of S-21.
And I would like to provide my observations on the following
situations.  Kok Sros did not clearly recognize any people except
those who were well known by the public like Peng, Huy Sre, Hor
and myself and besides, even Nat who was the former Chairman of
S-21, he did not even know.  So it is my observation that I am
not convinced he was a former S-1 guard.
I also would like to provide another testimony.  Kok Sros said
about a meeting regarding instructions to prevent the prisoners
escape.  If he were a member, the essence of the meeting would be
according to the circular instructions that all comrades are
instructed to follow the instructions by the S-21 document with
ERN 00008091.  If Peng really led a meeting, he would pass these
instructions on this document.
So, in summary, there are several issues which make me believe
that Kok Sros was not a member of the S-21 guards; however, I do
not completely reject his status.  If the Co-Investigating Judges
have any evidentiary documents to put before the Chamber that he
was a member, then I would accept it.
This is my response, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Lavergne, you take the floor.
BY JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Q. It seems to me that after such a statement, the witness should
have the possibility of providing his own clarifications in
relation to what I just heard and, in particular, to tell us if,
yes or no, he was a staff member at S-21.
A. I would like to clearly state that I am a former S-21 guard
starting from late 1975 until Phnom Penh fell, and this is my
response.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
So if I understood properly what the accused told us is that as
long as we do not have a written document that can check this
that, well, he believes that Mr. Kok Sros' statement is doubtful.
Is that what you are saying, but if we provide you a written
document that states that he was part of the S-21 staff you would
accept it.  Is that so?
THE ACCUSED:
Your Honour, I would like to state that the list of S-21 staff
from the time that I took control and during the investigation, I
never seen such a list submitted by the Co-Investigating Judges
to the Chamber.  So that is one issue.
And on a separate issue, regarding Kok Sros and other people who
allege themselves to be the S-21 staff, there might be a few
other people whom I might not know clearly.  So if there is S-21
documents on the list of staff, if their names are there and you
can clearly verify that categorically, I would accept their
testimonies.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Can you tell the Chamber today that you personally knew each one
of the staff members at S-21 or no?
THE ACCUSED:
Your Honour, the S-21 staff, for those who came from M-13 I knew
everyone of them without any exception; namely, Brother Mam Nai,
alias Chan, Tong Sun Hoeun, alias Pon, Prak Nan (phonetic), On
(phonetic), Oeun (phonetic), Tith.  I knew every one of them.
And for those forces who were the former city resistant forces,
there were five of them, and I knew every one of them.
And for those that came from 703 Division, I knew some of them
including Hor, Huy Sre, Huy from the Special Force, Phal, Snguon,
Pauch  and several interrogators and as well as Suos Thy
So for those whom I knew I would not deny their status, but I
can't say at this stage that I only know some of those forces
came from Division 703.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
Can you remind us of the number of people who were part of the
S-21 staff and who came from the 703rd Division and, in
particular, those who came from M-13?  Could you say that more
than 80 percent came from the 703rd Division?
THE ACCUSED:
Your Honour, the statistics that we received from the general
staff, which was submitted by the Co-Investigating Judges to the
Chamber, there were more than 2,000 staff, 2,300 something.  And
amongst those from M-13 including young and old, including my
guard, parents -- there were -- total number which was mentioned
in that document, and three people from the city force and the
other two only got married when they worked at S-21.  So that was
the city force.
Also, there were the teenagers from Kampong Chhnang.  There were
about 40 of them, and amongst those 40 I clearly knew four of
them.  I knew their names and I knew their faces and the rest,
they were the forces from 703, and in total they would be in
excess of 95 percent of the total forces employed at S-21.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
So regarding the 2,000 people you just spoke about, you knew
about 100?
THE ACCUSED:
No, less than 100; far less than 100.
JUDGE LAVERGNE:
I have no further questions, thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The hearing of the testimony of the witness Kok Sros now comes to
an end and also it is time for lunch break.  The Chamber will
adjourn the hearing this morning and we'll resume this afternoon.
Mr. Kok Sros, the Chamber would like to thank you for providing
your testimony before this Chamber.  We also have taken note of
the difficulties that you have experienced in providing your
testimony as being faced by several questions put to you by the
Chamber and by the various parties.
Secondly, the difficulty arose as a result of the facts which had
been for many years -- 30, 34 years already, and the recollection
of people in general tend to forget certain aspects of the facts.
Regardless of this, the Chamber appreciates your testimony and
you can now return to your residence.
Court Officer, make necessary arrangements for Mr. Kok Sros to
return to his residence.
And for this afternoon, starting from 1.30, the Chamber will hear
the testimony of a witness, KW-07.  So the hearing is now

QUESTIONING BY THE BENCH
BY MR. PRESIDENT:
Q. Mr. Witness, what is your name?
A. I am Suos Thy.
Q. Do you have any alias?
A. No, Your Honour, I don't have any other name.
Q. How old are you?
A. I'm 58 years old.
Q.  What is your occupation now?
A. I do farming.  I'm a farmer.
Q. According to the report of the Greffiers, it indicates clearly
that you have no blood relation with any parties to the
proceeding today and that you have taken an oath already.  Is
that correct?
A.  That is correct, Your Honour.
Q.  Mr. Suos Thy, as a witness who is testifying before the Trial
Chamber of the Extraordinary Chamber in the Courts of Cambodia,
you have the following rights and obligations.  As a witness, you
can choose not to respond to any questions that you believe or
you are afraid that your testimony could self-incriminate you.
So you have the right not to incriminate yourself.
At the same time, while you are a witness you have the obligation
to talk only about the truth; nothing but the truth.  And your
testimony shall not be from your assumption or conclusion other
than what you witnessed.  Do you understand what we have told
you?
A. Yes I do, Your Honour.
Q. Mr. Suos Thy, when did you join the revolutionary movement?
A. After the coup d'état staged by Lon Nol to topple down the
king, the former Prince Norodom Sihanouk.  And in 1971, late
1971, with the appeal of the former prince, I joined the army and
I was the local militia for the commune in Koh Keo, and later on
I was sent to work in a unit in the Special Zone near Phnom Penh.
And I was promoted to be the combatant of a regiment and I fought
in the battles in the battlefield near Phnom Penh until 1973 when
I was severely injured and was hospitalized for a few months.
After I was discharged from the hospital I was used as the medic
for the Battalion 112.  And in 1974, because my injury was still
severe, I was sent to the Company 23.  And Peng was actually the
chief of that battalion.
I was asked to register the lists or the names of combatants who
got injured during the battlefields and that I had to report to
the superior.  And I prepared or made the lists in this Battalion
112 until 1975 and after a few months, two months after the fall
of Phnom Penh, I was reassigned to my unit and I was the deputy
chief of that team.
Q. After the liberation day, after the 17th of April 1975 until
the 7th of January 1979, what had you done and in which units had
you worked?
A. After 1975 until 1979, first after two months I was assigned
to the unit and in late 1975 I saw Hor in the battalion I worked
in and then Hor asked that I work with him in the PJ location
near the central market.  And first I was not assigned any task.
I was later on given the lists, to prepare the lists of detainees
at that PJ prison or office.
In late 1975, maybe early 1976, the location of the prison was
changed to Tuol Sleng, current location, and I worked in the
guard unit.  And Hor asked me to take hold of the prisoners'
lists, to grasp or to control how many detainees were being sent
in and out and also to summarize their biographies.  And I had
been dealing with these lists until the day Phnom Penh was
liberated.
Q. You indicated that you administered the lists of the wounded
combatants and ammunition during the wartime before 1975 and in
the battlefields to liberate Phnom Penh from Lon Nol's regime.
And there was Huy you mentioned.  What was his full name?
A. He was Nun Huy or Huy Sre.  He was the commander of the
battalion.
Q. You also stated that after the 17th of April 1975 -- although
you said you were not quite sure but after that time Hor took you
to work in a location which was the former PJ prison -- or at the
prison.  Is that correct?
A. That is correct, Your Honour.
Q. Can you tell the Court about the full name of Hor, the Hor you
mentioned at the PJ, and what was his role?  What was his role
back then?
A. I don't remember his full name but actually he was the chief
of regiment of the Division 703, and later on he worked at S-21
as the deputy chairman of S-21, or Tuol Sleng.
Q. When Hor took you to work at a prison, the former PJ location,
at the beginning, where was it located?  If now, where would it
be?  Could you please give, for example, a landmark of importance
to which you can link that location to that important location --
for example, central market?
A. The PJ prison location is now located at the police
headquarters in Phnom Penh.
Q. Is it to the south of central market, about 200 metres to the
south of central market; is it correct?
A. It's correct, Your Honour; it's to the south of the central
market.
Q. Because currently this location is occupied by the police
headquarters, but the police headquarters has been swept to the
other side of the town because it's further from the TV tower, so
make sure that we understand the location very clearly.  So you
did say that the PJ location was once located at the current
location south to central market.
When you said the PJ location was used as the prison, so who was
in charge as the chairperson at that location?
A. When I first came to work at that location -- at the PJ
location -- I did not know whether it belonged to the S-21 but it
first originally belonged to Division 703 in which Brother Nat
was the chairman and Huy was the deputy chief of that PJ prison.
Q. How long did you work at the PJ location before it is changed
or moved to the S 21 location of Phnom Penh centre back then?
A. I don't remember in full but actually after one or two or
maybe three months after I had worked at that PJ location before
we were moved to the current S-21 location.
Q. During the few months -- initial few months, at that compound
before it was moved to the S-21 location, had you ever known the
accused, alias Duch, back then?
A. I had never known him at the PJ prison.
Q. When did you start to get to know him -- to know the accused?
A. I came to know him only when Ta Nat was removed and that Duch
was promoted to be the Chairman of S-21.
Q. Do you know what was the reason behind the removal of In Lorn,
alias Nat, from the position?  So when Nat was removed was S-21
still located at the PJ location or was it already moved to S-21,
or current Tuol Sleng prison compound?
A. Mr. President, could you please repeat your question?  I may
not understand it well.
Q. You said Nat was removed and that a new chairman was put to
replace Nat.  The question is that when such removal took place,
did it happen at the former location of the PJ prison or did it
happen only when the location was already moved to the current
S-21, or Tuol Sleng, prison location?
A. Ta Nat was replaced at the PJ location, not at the current
location at S-21.
Q. So this means that when you started working at the PJ
location, or prison, you were under the supervision of Nat and
that a few months later Nat was removed and Duch was in place of
that position, and later on, after Duch was promoted, then the
location was moved to the current location.  Is that a fair
assumption of what we understand from you?
A. That is true.  It's correct, Your Honour.
Q. When Hor took you to work with him, you said you were asked to
administer the prisoners list.  The first question is when you
first arrived at the PJ location was it a name already used, the
PJ prison, or was there any other name to identify that location
at the outset?
Question number 2:  what were you in charge back then at the very
outset when you worked at the PJ location?
A. At the PJ location it was known as the 703 Division prison and
at the beginning I
was asked to prepare the lists of the detainees who were brought
in on a daily basis.
Q. Had you ever heard Dam Pheng prison?
A. I did not pay attention to know that Dam Pheng prison because
I worked at that location, I did not move about, and I was only
put to administer the prisoners' lists; that's all.
Q. Could you please tell the Court about the work you had done in
relation to the administering of the lists of detainees from the
time when you worked at the Division 703 prison until you were
about to be moved to the S-21?  Just tell us about those kind of
work before S-21.
A. When I was made to keep the lists of detainees, my task was to
register thereby a brief biography of any detainees who was being
brought in.  I was asked to only record their names of the
parents and where they were from, and I had to report on a
regular basis to the chief of the division, and at that time Meng
was put in charge and I had to report to him every day.
Q. When detainees were arrested and detained at 703 Division
prison and that you were in charge of keeping such lists of the
detainees, were there any photographs taken?
A. I don't remember having seen anyone being photographed.  After
their biographies were obtained detainees would be detained.  At
that location, the 703 Division prison, there were very few
detainees and the list was drawn or made without having any
detainee's photograph be taken.
Q. You said that there were only few detainees while you had been
working at that PJ location.  So can you give us approximate
figures of detainees who had been detained and sent into that
prison?
A. The work at Division 703 was based on the list prepared
earlier.  I had to only input new entry, which was very few.  I
mean the new entry regarding the new detainees; there were very
few of them.
Q. So you said there were very few here, referring to the numbers
of detainees who were asked by your superior that you put into
the list.  But in conclusion, can you give us approximate figures
of all the detainees, including those that you had not prepared
the list.
A. The detainees who had already been arrested, on top of what I
had registered, I think there were approximately 100 people only,
more or less.
Q. You were the list holder or documents holder.  Did you know
that among the 100 or so detainees arrested and detained at
Division 703 prison, where were they sent from?  What kinds of
people were they?  Were they the former combatants, former Lon
Nol soldiers, or were they the officials from Lon Nol's regime?
A. At 703 Division prison there were not any internal detainees
yet.  They were the workers, officials, workers of the factories,
but there were no people arrested inside the Party's rank yet.
There were only the factory workers and the people of the 17th of
April.
Q. Did you know where those people were arrested?  So where the
703 Division arrested those people, I mean the 100 or so people.
A. I did not know because the arrests were carried out outside.
Q. The 100-plus people who were detained at the 703 Division
prison, as you said, after the prison was relocated from PJ to
the Tuol Sleng prison which is currently known as the museum, the
Tuol Sleng Museum, were those prisoners -- or where were those
prisoners taken to?
A. After the 703 prison relocated to Tuol Sleng the prisoners
were also brought from that location to Tuol Sleng prison.
Q. During the time that you worked at that location, besides
making the list of the incoming prisoners did you also work on
the list of the outgoing prisoners, besides the remaining
prisoners who were transferred to the S-21 prison that is now
known as the Tuol Sleng Genocidal Museum?  At that particular
time were there any prisoners taken out and did you work on the
list of the outgoing prisoners as well as on the incoming
prisoners?
A. So when the prison was relocated from the 703 Division to the
Tuol Sleng all the prisoners from the old location were brought
to the new location and none of the prisoners was killed at that
time.
Q. During the times that you first worked at the PJ location did
you ever go to another prison to belong to 703 Division which was
located at the psychiatric hospital in Ta Khmau?
A. During the time that I worked at the 703 Division prison at PJ
I never went to the Ta Khmau prison because in the Ta Khmau
prison there was already a person who administered the list.
Q. Now let me talk about the times that you came to work and
administer the list at the Santebal Office or S-21 Office in
Phnom Penh.  And let me remind you that location is now known as
the Genocidal Museum of Tuol Sleng.  When you first arrived at
that location what was your assignment and what was your role in
carrying out your assignment?
A. After the 703 prison was relocated to Tuol Sleng prison and
upon my arrival I was still assigned to work on the list, which
is the list of the incoming and outgoing prisoners.  Another task
that I was assigned to was to write and record biographies of the
prisoners on a piece of paper before a photograph was attached to
that biography.  Also I had to report constantly the total number
of the daily incoming and outgoing prisoners to the S-21A, where
Meng was in charge of the list of the prisoners in that location.
Q. What was your unit called and how many people working there,
and who was the chief?
A. In my unit it was called S-21B or, in brief, it's the guards
unit and Hor was the chairman of that unit.
Q. Hor was a deputy chairman and he also was the general chief of
the guards unit.  What about your team?  Who was the chief and
how many people in that group?
A. In the group of making list it was only I who made the list
because the list -- the records were brief to be written on the
list and there was only I who worked on the list.
Q. What about the photography section?  Which unit did it belong
to; was it separate or was it part of your unit?
A. The photography unit was part of the S-21A unit under Meng's
supervision, and Meng was also a list-maker at S-21A.
Q. Today it is new to us that we have heard the words S-21A and
S-21B.  So far we have only heard of M-13A and M-13B at Amleang,
and we have also heard that the S-21 office located in Phnom Penh
and another one is called S-24 or the re-education camp at Prey
Sar.  And now you have said about S-21A and S-21B.  For the
S-21A, who was in charge of the S-21A Office and what was his
role?
A. The chief of the S-21A Office was Duch.  He was an overall
Chairman in charge of all the units in S-21A.  However, to make
it easy to understand, S-21A is an interrogation unit and the
S-21B was the guard unit, and the S-21C was the rice fields unit
which was later on called the S-24.
Q. So regarding the structure, S-21 which is called the Security
Office S-21 or S-21 prison was an overall office and there were
three subordinate offices under S-21, i.e. S 21A, the
interrogation unit; and S-21B, the guard unit or section; and
then the S-21C which is the re-education office at Prey Sar.  Is
this correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Let me make it clear that we have to really work on the
structure of S-21 so that there shall be no misunderstanding,
because now you talk about the S-21A, B, C, and D.  Were there
any S-21C or D or S-24, as you said?
A. From what I heard, there were only S-21A, S-21B and S-21D or
S-24.  I did not hear of any S-21C.
Q. You said S-21A was the interrogation section.  Were there
other sections under S 21A?
A. Under S-21A there was the interrogation section, the economics
section, the photography section and the typist section.  So
there were like four sections under S-21A.
Q. And what about S-21B?  How many units under S-21B?
A. Under S-21B there was only the guard unit and also the kitchen
-- the cooks group was also under S-21B.
Q. What about the Special Unit?  Did you ever hear of the Special
Unit or the company?
A. The company, it was under the guards unit.  Initially the
Special Unit was under the supervision of the 703 Division and so
when it was transferred over it was still referred to as the
Special Unit.
Q. We want to know about the Special Unit which was initially
from the 703 Division.  So which unit of S-21B was it integrated
into?  You said one Special Unit from the 703 Division was
integrated into the S-21 and you also talk about S-21B where the
guard unit was in, and was the special force also in the S-21B?
A. The Special Unit while at the PJ prison it was under the
direct supervision of Nat, the chairman of the division.
However, at Tuol Sleng the Special Unit was under the supervision
of the guard unit under the supervision of Hor.
Q. What about the motor pool or the drivers?  Which unit it
belonged to?
A. For the motor pool it was under the Special Unit.  Let me add
a bit further.  The Special Unit initially was under the 703
Division and messengers belonged into that unit later on at Tuol
Sleng.  So it was still called Special Unit under the supervision
of Hor under the guard section.
Q. Are there any other units?  And what about the medical unit?
Where did it belong too?
A. The medical unit was also under the S-21A; that is under the
interrogation section.  However, later on after the previous
medics were arrested, when the new ones arrived, then they were
under the supervision of the guard section of S-21B.
Q. What about those who worked in the kitchen, who cooked for the
S-21 staff and cadres?  Which section or unit did it belong to --
A, B or D?
A. The cook for the cadres was under S-21B; that is under the
guard section.  And for those who cooked were under the economic
unit, who also cooked both for the cadres and for the prisoners.
Q. Were the kitchens separate -- those for the cadres and those
for the prisoners?
A. It was a common kitchen for both S-21A and S-21B; that is for
both the interrogation and the guard sections.
Q. You talk about the separate sections.  The S-21A, where the
economic section was in, and they also provide food to the
prisoners, and those cooks in the S-21B provided food to the
cadres.  Were those who worked in the common kitchen but for
different sections used the common equipment in the kitchen,
common tools?
A. I am not clear on this matter because I did not go to the
kitchen.
Q. What about the S-21D?  What was the clear structure of S-21D
and who was in charge?
A. For the S-21D I was not familiar with its structure.  However,
the chief was Nun Huy.  He supervised the S-21D.
Q. Let's talk about your task that you administered the list of
incoming and outgoing prisoners at S-21.  First let's focus on
your location where you worked.  Where did you work?  Did you
work within the S-21 compound?
A. The guard office where Hor worked was inside and I also was
assigned by Hor to work on the lists inside the office; that is
inside the prison compound.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Court Officer, can you project on the slide the document with the
ER number 00189137?  Please use the projector, not the screen of
the computer.
Can you make a proper light adjustment on this?  It looks a bit
too bright.  It's a bit too big now.  Can you zoom out a bit?
That is fine now.
BY MR. PRESIDENT:
Q. Mr. Witness, can you look at this photo?  The top part is the
west and to the right is the north and to the bottom is the east
and your left is the south.  And there are buildings photographed
and marked with Latin letters and there are five of them.
From the east, the building on the left, on the far left, is
Building A.  And then the north-south building is Building B, and
next to it on the north is Building C.  And further right, that's
Building D.  And in front of it, in front of us, it's called
Building E.  In French it's E.
And the location where you worked, which building where you
worked amongst the five buildings here of the Tuol Sleng prison?
A. It was in a building next to the entrance.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Court officer, can you give the witness a pen so that he can
indicate the location?
THE WITNESS:
That was the office where I worked, towards the east.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
Court officer, you can remove the document from the projector
now.
BY MR. PRESIDENT:
Q. Mr. Suos Thy, can you describe to the Chamber so that we know
the process of registering on the incoming list and the outgoing
list of S-21 -- how was it done?  You don't have to respond now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I notice the presence of the civil party lawyer, group 1.  Mr.
Werner, you may proceed.
MR. WERNER:
I apologize for interrupting Your Honour.  I just would like the
record to show that, answering your previous question, the
witness took a pen and actually indicated Building E, and if it's
not on the record then that will not be known.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the record, it was Building E.  It was to the front of
Building E towards the east where the witness worked.  So it was
from the middle of Building E towards the front where Mr. Sous
Thy worked.
BY MR. PRESIDENT:
Q. Mr. Suos Thy, can you describe to us the operation of working
on the lists, how the lists were processed for both the incoming
prisoners and the outgoing prisoners?
A. When the prisoners were brought in by the Special Unit, the
Special Unit brought the prisoners in from outside and they were
brought through the main entrance on the east.  And once they
were brought in they were asked to sit and then I would record
their names one by one.  It was a brief recording of the names,
their positions, and the villages or the sub districts.
And after that, let me say that during the time when the
prisoners were brought in they were still in handcuffs and
blindfolds and during the recording of their names they were
still in blindfolds and they were still tied or cuffed.  And
after I took down their names the prisoners would be taken to the
photography location, which is not far from where I worked.  It
was just next.  So actually I recorded their names outside a room
and they later on were brought into the room to be photographed.
After they were photographed then they would blindfold the
prisoners and then the guards would take those prisoners who were
already photographed into the rooms or cells.  And once they were
brought into the rooms or cells after I made their brief
biography I had to register which rooms they had to be detained
in, and in which building, in order to combine them into the list
so that which prisoners and how many of them were detained in
which buildings and in which rooms, common rooms or individual
cells, and that would facilitate the guards when they had to
bring those prisoners for interrogation.  So that is the
operation for the incoming prisoners.
Regarding the outgoing prisoners, when there was an annotation
from Duch a list would be given to Hor and Hor would send the
list to me to extract the names and the room numbers and the
buildings so that the guards would be able to identify them and
to take them out.  And during the process the prisoners had to be
brought to the front of the main entrance so that they would not
be mistaken.  Hor reminded me if I made a mistake in identifying
a prisoner then I would be accused as a traitor or an enemy.
So once they were brought to the front near the gate then I would
ask them again regarding their names and positions, and once it's
finished I would give the list back to Hor so that Hor would
assign the forces to take them out.
Q. So the lists of detainees that was prepared initially when any
detainee was being sent into the S-21 then -- I mean the
detainees who were sent by the Special Unit, they would be sent
to you so that you can register their names before they would be
taken for photographs.  Is that correct?
A. It is correct, Your Honour.
Q. When did they put the photos onto the biography of any
detainee?
A. A biography would be attached to a photo gradually because I
was alone and I could not do it immediately.  So we only
processed it gradually.
Q. After photographs were being taken then detainees would be
sent to the detention rooms, including the common room and the
individual cells.  And you said that at that moment you had to
verify the detainees' names again to make sure that you did not
make a mistake in counting them.  Is that correct?
A. In the process of taking the detainees into the detention room
then if the small rooms were vacant they would then be fit in
that room except the small rooms downstairs were filled or
occupied, then the latecomers would be sent to upstairs.
Q. So who notified you whether the rooms were vacant or not and,
for example, who made a decision to put prisoner or detainee A or
B into any particular room?  Were you in charge to do so or you
were only assigned to record their names and that after all the
guards would be in charge to bring them to any respective cells
or rooms and that you only go there finally to verify the records
of the names, when they came and when they were being sent to the
room, whether the names are consistent?
A. Detainees were taken to the detention facility or rooms by the
guards and I was not entitled to take them to their rooms.  When
the rooms were free for accommodating more detainees then the
guards would take them to those respective rooms.  I was not in
charge of doing so.
Q. So after that you had to go to each room to verify the
attendance?  I mean after the detainees were already sent to the
common or individual cells.  So what else did you do?
A. After I already verified the names of the detainees who were
put into each room I would come back to my workplace to retype
the names so that we can have the final list and have it reported
to the superior and awaiting for the next assignment for
tomorrow.
Q. You can please continue your testimony.
A. I would like -- that I had to report to the superior and that
in the report there was no indication of smaller or bigger rooms.
We only had the names of the detainees and we did not list down
even the titles -- correction; I reported the names of the
detainees along with their roles and occupations, but I did not
put in which room these particular detainees were detained.
Q. During the time when you were asked to record the detainees,
were all the detainees be registered and that their photographs
be taken or were there any exceptions; that there was no
biography taken and photographs were not taken either or was it
not a case?
A. Regarding the detainees who were being sent in, not all of
them were sent straight to me because the important detainees
would be segregated and they were not put to have their
biographies taken because they were then put into their special
prisons, and only later that Hor would come to me and bring in
the names so that I can have them registered.
Q. If Hor was the one in charge of bringing the names of those
people who put in the special prison, how could their photographs
be processed or taken?
A. Regarding the important detainees, I don't think I grasped
hold of what happened to them regarding the photography or how
they were being taken photograph because it was the superior who
would be entitled to understand this.
Q. Had you ever seen any children who came along or who were
arrested along with their parents and sent to S-21?  If you had
seen those children, were they also -- were their names also
registered in your list?
A. Children who were sent to Tuol Sleng's Office were seen coming
along with their parents and there was a list of the children.
Their biographies were not processed or obtained.
Q. Were they taken photographs then?
A. I did not register their names in the lists but they were not
taken photographs either.
Q. So it is fair to say that children were not supposed to have
their photos taken and that their biography was not subjected to
be taken either.  Is that correct?
A. Yes, it is, Your Honour.
Q. In your view, since you had worked close to the entrance of
the detention facility and from the very outset when you started
working at S-21 until the 7th of January 1979, can you give us
the approximate figures of those children who were sent along
with their parents to that location?
A. I did not pay attention to the children because I had paid
great attention to the detainees, who was part of my job to
register their names, but I could have some estimation of the
figures but I have heard from other people and I think it would
not be fair to give my assumption in this Court anyway.
Q. It is obvious that you did not register their names, you did
not obtain their biographies, and that their photographs were not
being taken, but the Court is only interested to know if you can
just give us the rough estimation of the figures of those
children.  Were there about 100 of them or less than that?
A. I think it's about hundreds of them.
Q. Had you ever seen any foreign detainees, especially the
Westerners, the white-complexioned detainees; for example, people
from Europe?  So had you ever registered their names into your
list?
A. I think Western detainees were not going through my location.
They were sent to be detained straight at the special prison.
Q. Could you please proceed with your testimony?
A. And Hor actually administered their names and Hor would advise
his subordinate to have their names registered on a daily basis.
I was not in charge of them.
Q. Can you give me an estimate of the numbers of foreigners who
were detained there?
A. I think my estimation can be wrong but there were about three
or four of them.
Q. Had you also registered any pregnant detainees into your list?
A. I did not pay good attention to any pregnant women.  I think
it has been long time ago.  Maybe there were some of them or
maybe there were not.
Q. Had you ever received Vietnamese prisoners of war or
Vietnamese civilians during the time when there were armed
conflicts between Cambodia and Vietnam?
A. During the conflicts we had received both civilians and
soldiers, the Vietnamese civilians and soldiers.
Q. How many Vietnamese prisoners of war and how many Vietnamese
civilians were sent to that location, based on your best
recollection?
A. I don't remember exactly how many soldiers and how many
Vietnamese civilians were brought in.
I would like to make it clear that at that time I worked my best
to have their name registered and I was alone on my own and
that's why I only focussed on putting them into the list.
Q. Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it is now a convenient time for a break or adjournment.
Then we now will take an adjournment for 15 minutes and the Court
officer is now instructed to make sure that the witness is taken
to the waiting room and have a good rest and we resume at 3 p.m.
We note the Co-Prosecutor is on his feet.  You take the floor.
MR. AHMED:
Just a point of clarification.  Maybe it was a translation
problem and I would suggest to Your Honours, may I put a question
for that clarification?
When Mr. President asked the question, "How many children were
detained?" and Mr. President said was it 100 or thereabouts, I
could not get whether the witness said a hundred or hundreds of
them.  I would most respectfully submit that that could be
clarified.
THE GREFFIER:
All rise.
(Judges exit courtroom)
(Court recesses from 1448H to 1503H)
(Judges enter courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please be seated.  The Chamber is now back in session.
We will continue to hear the testimony of the witness Suos Thy.
BY MR. PRESIDENT:
Q. Before the break the International Co-Prosecutor put a
question to the Chamber for clarification to the witness
regarding the total number of children which he observed during
his work as a record-keeper at the S-21 security office in Phnom
Penh.
The Chamber also took note of the uncertainty that you have said
because you yourself did not involve directly with the children
as they only came along with their parents.  And you talk about
hundred or hundreds.  So can you verify whether they were in the
total number of 100, more than 100, or less than 100?
When you talk about more than 100, it could be less than 200.
However, when you say several hundreds, it could be three, four,
500.  So can you provide a clearer response to this question?
How many, in total?
A. For the children, according to my observation, though I am not
certain, it could be more than 100, up to 200 the most.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Co-Prosecutor, so now you clearly hear; it's between 100 to
200.
BY MR. PRESIDENT:
Q. The Vietnamese prisoners of war who were arrested and brought
to the centre, did you know the total number or were they in the
total of 100, less than 100, or under 200, or under 300?
We don't want a clear total number if you don't have it because
it's been happening so long already.  So can you please provide
your estimate on the total number?
A. From my recollection, although it is not clear, I think the
total number was less than 100 for the Vietnamese prisoners of
war.
Q. What about the Vietnamese civilians; what is the total number?
A. I am also not clear, it is my estimate.  The number could be
100 or a little bit over 100.
Q. Regarding the working hours, when you worked on the list and
making the list of the incoming prisoners or the outgoing
prisoners, now at this time let me talk about the list for the
incoming prisoners who were arrested from outside and brought to
the centre by the Special Force.  When did you start working?
What is your working hours?
A. Working with the list of the incoming prisoners, the working
hours varied.  I was asked to be on alert 24 hours a day because
the prisoners came at various times, sometimes in the morning, at
noon, in the evenings, sometimes at 12 midnight, sometimes at
4   a.m. in the morning.
Q. So you had to be on standby 24 hours per day, and you started
working once the prisoners were sent without any delay.  Is this
correct?
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. While you were working there, did you ever witness the arrival
of those who were arrested en masse, who were sent at one time or
in one day?  Did you ever witness that?
A. For the prisoners who were sent, usually the number could be
four, 10, 20 or 30 at the most, however, toward the late 1978
they were sent en masse.  Sometimes there could be more than 100
of them, but not on many occasions that they were sent.  They
were usually sent from the northwest zone on a few occasions.  As
I said earlier, the regular number ranged from one person to 20.
Q. Did you ever experience the sending to S-21 of the prisoners
in large number and did the Special Force drive the vehicles that
transported the prisoners directly into and inside the S-21
compound as they were in large number, because we have heard that
when they were brought in in smaller number they would be walked
from outside into the main entrance of S-21.  But in large
scales, they would be transported into the vehicle by the Special
Force inside the compound.  Did you ever witness that?
A. Yes.  There were cases like that.
Q. If so, what was the process of processing those prisoners and
how was the photographer process those prisoners?
A. Towards the end, when they were brought in en masse, the
prisoners were not brought into the location where they would be
photographed.  They were put into the detention facility and I
went to that location to make the lists there directly.  I only
recorded their names onto the list.
Q. You can continue.
A. However, regarding the photograph, I'm not sure.  Maybe Hor
would assign a photographer to photograph those before they were
entered into the rooms, and that only happened toward late 1978.
Q. We talked about the times when the prisoners were sent in
large scale.  And when you had to make a brief biography of each
prisoner and usually you would write the brief biography straight
away and then you would hand over the prisoners to the guards,
and the guards would send them to the detention rooms or the
interview cells.
And, in such cases, when the prisoners were brought in in large
scale, did the guards take those prisoners to be put into the
common rooms or in the interview cells and shackle them first
before you went to the rooms or the cells in order to register
their names on the list?
Or how was it done?  Were they detained in the rooms first, and
then the list was made later?  Or the list was made at the same
time as they were brought in and later on they were handed over
to the guards for them to take to the detention rooms?
A. Let me clarify the process of the incoming prisoners.
Once they arrived at my location, I registered their biography
and the guards would, on their own, take them to their detention
rooms or cells.  And for us, when we went to those rooms we did
not go and make the list, we only get from the guards which
prisoners were put in which rooms or cells.
Q. So when the prisoners were brought en masse then the
operations were the same, that is, to extract their brief
biographies, and later on they were handed over to the guards so
the guards could take them to be detained in the rooms or cells.
Also, the common process would be when you would go and inquire
from the guards which rooms the prisoners were brought in, so you
would register the room numbers or the cells numbers onto the
list.  Is that correct?  Do you understand the question?
A. Yes, I do.
In principle, the prisoners, once they were brought in, they
would be questioned for their brief biography and, later on, the
guards would take them to be detained into the rooms or cells.
And, later on, when we went into the rooms we did not ask for any
further biography.  We only asked the guards for the room numbers
for those prisoners.  So that we would ask the room numbers and
the building and that information would be kept at my location,
at my office, and not to be sent to the upper echelon because
then when they would come to me to inquire about a prisoner then
I can tell them which room or which building they were detained.
Q. In the detention facilities, that is the common rooms and the
individual cells; were the numbers clearly displayed for those
individuals' cells and the common rooms were any codes used?  So
if codes were not used, what was the process?
A. In the detention rooms they always have numbers, including the
numbers for the individual cells.  Also the building had a
number.  However, these numbers are for my own use in my section
in order to facilitate the interrogation section, so that they
could ask the guards to bring them in.  But the reports which
were sent to the upper echelon did not contain the room or the
cell numbers.
Q. Through your observation, when the prisoners were brought in
-- as you said, they were brought in by the special force and you
talk about the guards.  The guards, after the prisoners were
asked for their biographies and were photographed, then those
guards would take them to the common rooms or to the individual
cells.  Were they taken by the guards unit or by that same
Special Unit?
A. The prisoners who were brought in by the Special Unit, they
were brought inside the compound.  However, once the prisoners
were inside then the prisoners would be handed over to the guards
section to take them to the individual cells or rooms.
Q. As you worked there directly, the prisoners who were handed
over from the special force to the guard unit after their brief
biographies and photographs were taken, and later on the guards
took them to the common rooms and the individual cells, were
those prisoners still in their dress or were their dress or
clothes removed?
A. Let me clarify the previous question to make it clear.
Regarding the special force who brought the prisoners inside the
compound, then the guard section would tell them which rooms or
which individual cells were vacant and available.  Then the
special force would take those prisoners into those vacant rooms
or individual cells.
Can you restate your second question, please?
Q. So the special force duty was to deliver those prisoners
inside the compound and hand it over to you to extract their
brief biographies for each prisoner, and after that they would be
photographed, and after that the special force still had the duty
to take them to the detention room or individual cells, and only
after that they would be handed over to the guards.  Is this a
fair assumption?
A. That is correct.
Q. The questions that I asked you previously, did you observe
when the prisoners were brought in and later on they were taken
to be detained in their rooms, were they still in the same
clothing or were the clothes removed?  That is the pants or long
shirts removed and they only were allowed to wear shorts?
A. The prisoners who were brought into my location, the way they
dressed were varied.  Sometimes they only wore shorts.  Some of
them still wore pants, although I am not certain on this.
Q. Thank you.  Let me talk about another stage, that is, the
interrogation phase.  What was your task involved in relation to
the interrogation group regarding the processing of the prisoners
to be taken out for interrogation and brought in after the
interrogation?
A. In relation to my involvement with the interrogation unit was
that the interrogation unit would give me the name.  I only
needed the name and the ministry because I already knew their
position.  Then I would indicate the room number and the building
and then the interrogation unit itself would go and take the
prisoners for interrogation.  And when the interrogation
completed they did not come to me.  The prisoners would be
brought into the rooms by the interrogation unit itself.
Q. So if they needed they would come to you to get the number,
the cell number, and the building number.  Who actually annotated
on the letter?  Was it in writing?  Who actually authorized for
you to indicate the prisoners to be taken out for interrogation?
A. The names given to me by the interrogation, it was on a small
piece of paper without any annotation.  It was just the name and
the position on a piece of paper.
Q. I would like you to reiterate again.  You already said that
the list of the incoming prisoners, when they were done you would
report, and whom did you report to and what was his position?
A. Regarding the daily list of the incoming prisoners, I made a
daily report at 7 a.m.  It had to be finished by that time, and
after I completed the list I gave the list to Hor for his
signature.  After he signed it I would then take the list to give
to Meng who was in charge of the interrogation unit, which was
the S-21A unit.
Q. During the administering of prisoners at S-21 were there cases
where prisoners were relocated from the common rooms to the
individual cells, or from the individual cells after
interrogation to the common rooms?  Did such cases exist?
A. The relocation of prisoners happened constantly according to
the report made by the interrogation unit.  Once the prisoner was
interrogated and if the prisoner was from the common room, then
that prisoner would be taken into the individual to separate the
person from those held in a common room and that was reported to
Hor and from Hor I knew, and then I would make the adjustment on
the list; that is the change from the common room to the
interview cell.
Q. Did you ever experience an incident where you met a prisoner
and that prisoner died?  Did you ever witness such cases?
A. For the prisoners who died in the rooms, I did not witness it
personally.  I only saw the report made by the medical personnel
because in each building there was a standby medic and, if a
prisoner was sick, then the medic would report to Hor and also a
medic would report if a prisoner died.  So from the report from
the medic which was sent to Hor, I would take that one and make
the adjustment on the list that I had.
Q. So for the prisoners who died due to sickness or insufficient
food, you would also make a list -- that is, to remove them from
the list according to the report that you received.  But you,
personally, did not go and witness it as it was the
responsibility of the medical unit and then the guard unit would
report to Hor and Hor would give the report to you.  Is this a
fair assumption?
A. That is correct.
Q. Did you know if at S-21 an incident such as the drawing of
blood from the prisoners occurred according to the needs of the
hospitals?  Did you hear or did you know about the drawing of the
blood from the prisoners?
A. Regarding the prisoners whose blood was drawn, I did not
witness it personally, but I knew it as Hor asked me to request
the list of the prisoners whose blood was drawn into the list of
prisoners to be smashed.
Q. What did Hor order you so that you knew about the blood -- the
drawing of blood and that the names of those had to be included
into the list of prisoners to be smashed?  What was the process
from the start or the beginning regarding this section?
A. Regarding the drawing of blood, the medical unit made a
request to Hor and Hor, subsequently, made a request to Duch
because any removal of any prisoner had to be authorized from
Duch.  So the drawing of blood, I personally did not witness it,
but for any prisoner whose blood was drawn, the prisoner would
die.
Later, Hor would receive the report from the medical unit
indicating the names that they requested from Hor and, later on,
I would verify the list against my list and that's all.
Q. Were you told by Hor to prepare any list in advance; for
example, the list of A, B, C who were expected to have their
blood drawn because normally, as what we heard, the practice was
that the blood would have been drained from any detainee until
they're dying?
So were you assigned to prepare such lists; I mean the lists of
detainees to be taken to have their blood drawn and that, later
on, their names would be included in the list of people to be
smashed, or were the people who registered in the list of the
people to have their blood drawn already considered as people in
the list of the people to be smashed, or can you tell the Court,
precisely, what were you supposed to do according to the orders
from Hor regarding to be taken the blood detainees?
A. After any detainee's blood was drawn, then the report would be
sent to Hor.
Q. So what about your list, how could you have these names
registered?
Please, wait until you see the red light before you can respond,
otherwise your message cannot be communicated.  Please, answer
again.
A. Regarding the "to smash" list, after a detainee was taken
blood, then the next day
there would be a report to Hor, then Hor would take the names of
the people whose blood was drawn to be included in the list of
people to be smashed.  However, I'm not quite sure about this
whether the people whose blood was drawn had to be included in
the smashed list or not.
Q. To the best of your recollection, when the detainees whose
blood was drawn and then their names included in the list of
people to be smashed, how many of them were they?  I mean, how
many people were taken to have their blood drawn?  Just give us
an approximate figure.
A. I'm not quite sure, but approximately there would have been
two times when prisoners were taken to have their blood drawn,
and in each occasion there would have been only, like, four to 10
people at a time.  So altogether, maybe, there were only about 20
people who were taken to have their blood drawn.
Q. Where were was the place in which the detainees would have
their blood drained or drawn?
A. It was not inside the prison compound, that the medic would
take them to the outside location, and I was not in the position
to know where it would have been taking place.
Q. So if you was not involved in knowing where these detainees
would be taken to, how could you tell the guards or the people
who were to take those detainees to have their blood drawn, which
room -- did they know the detainees would have been detained and
the people who were to be taken away to have their blood drawn?
So please tell us more about this.
A. To clarify this, for the detainees who were taken by the medic
to have their blood drawn, actually, before such practice could
take place, there was a request made to Hor and before the
detainees were taken out I would be informed or asked to identify
the location of the detainees because it was part of my job.
Q. You had known this because you were involved in the register
of the detainees.  And to your best memory were all the detainees
who were detained at S-21 interrogated or were there any
exceptions? Exceptions here mean people would not be interrogated
at all.
A. I think I'm not quite sure whether all the detainees were
subjected to be interrogated or there were exceptions or not.
Q. Now, let's talk about the outgoing list of detainees.  In
preparing the lists for detainees to be taken out from the
prison, could you tell the Court of the process?
A. After Hor received the lists, the full lists from Duch who
already annotated on those lists, then Hor would give the list to
me to verify the numbers, the names, especially who would be
taken away to be smashed and who would remain at the premises.
And after that I have to register in the list by identifying the
building they belonged to in order to facilitate the guards to
take them out.  And after registering the room numbers and the
building number then I would give the list back to Hor who later
on assigned his men to take the prisoners out.
At the beginning, prisoners would not be taken to the outside of
the compound.  They would only be unlocked and then taken to the
outside next to their room and then I had to verify their names
and roles, so on and so forth.  And that I was well-informed and
warned that if I made any mistake with the names of the detainee
then I would be accountable for the wrongdoing.
I was warned by Hor and I had to make sure that the information
was precise so I had to double check it before I gave the list to
Hor.  And that's the time when my duty ended.
Q. When you said that detainees would be taken out to be executed
then the list should be re-adjusted and that there would have
been annotation from Duch to Hor who later on sent the list to
you to verify them, and that you helped facilitate this process
to verify the names because you would like to make sure that it
would be easy for Hor to assign his men to take them out.
And you said detainees were taken out of the room and were they
taken to the door, the gateway at the entrance to S-21 or were
they just taken out from their rooms, or respective rooms and --
while their names were being verified?
A. They were put at the entrance or the gate, the access to the
prison compound while their names were finally verified.
Q. Did you have to do that in general as a principle or did it
only happen when there were en masse sending out of detainees to
be executed and that while there were fewer detainees to be sent
out that you did not have to do that?
Can you please elaborate further on this?
A. Regardless of any number of detainees to be taken out, the
process would be identical, because I had no time to inspect
inside the prison cells because these detainees had to be taken
to the gate, the entrance and so I had to follow the same routine
with fewer or more detainees.
Q. When trucks would be coming to pick them up, were the trucks
parked outside the compound or were they allowed to come into the
complex to pick those detainees before they could be loaded to be
executed?
A. Detainees would be loaded on the trucks which parked outside.
And after the final names were verified then the truck would
leave or take off and the door, the gate door would be locked and
the trucks were not allowed to come in.
Q. So at that time the front gate was locked.  Is that correct?
And that only a small path would be allowed for anyone to access
to that location in order to make it easy for you and for other
people to verify the names of the detainee to be sent to be
executed?
A. That is correct, because the door would be partially opened to
make sure that only one detainee would be walking out at a time
to that truck.
Q. Could you try to recollect the times when there were fewer
detainees being taken away to be executed at the nearby location
next to the compound of S-21?  Were there the same practices or
routines like those when detainees would be taken away to be
executed at Choeung Ek?  Please, can you tell the Court about
this?
A. When detainees were taken to be executed just in the
neighbourhood of the S-21,  the operation would be the same.  The
difference is that when there were more people to be executed at
Choeung Ek then there would be involved with trucks, and that's
all.
Q. So when detainees had to be smashed at the nearby location at
S-21 were they also transported by trucks or were they walked to
be executed?
A. I don't remember quite well because I was not involved in how
people would be taken away, because I only paid great attention
to my task to verify their names, although I knew that trucks
would be parking outside.
But when it comes to detainees who were killed in the
neighbourhood, I didn't know for sure.
Q. The reason I asked this question, because in the case file
there are documents and there is information concerning the
individual detainee who would be taken away to be smashed in that
nearby compound.  But then in the early 1980 the mass graves were
exhumed and several mass graves were exhumed, and according to
the records there were -- in some mass graves there were 28
bodies, and at least 16 bodies were buried in each mass grave.
That's why we asked this question regarding the execution and how
execution was carried out when it involved fewer people and more
people; for example, whether detainees would be taken altogether
at once and that they were sent out from the vicinity and that
the door would be locked and that the list would be finalized.
Or were there be a kind of process in which one detainee at a
time would be taken out and that the list would be finally
verified and this process could take time, for example like
hours?
That's why it is important to know about this and we want to seek
further clarification from you, so to your best recollection can
you tell the Court whether you can remember it?
A. In general, I think in short, I don't remember quite well
because normally after the final -- the list was finally
verified, then they would be loaded on the trucks and they would
not be walked.
Q. Were you supposed to actually also make another list after
execution was already carried out?
A. After any detainee was taken out and after the final list
verified, the list would have been sent to Hor, who sent to the
guards, including Huy and Peng who were holding the lists after
all.  And after the detainees were executed then Hor would grab
the list and then I would verify the list against the detainees
who were still in the prison and those who were already smashed.
Q. So this process applied to both en masse execution and small
execution.  Is that correct?
A. It's correct, Your Honour.
Q. Were you trained or instructed, and from whom, regarding your
daily operation at the location?
A. How the lists were prepared were instructed by Hor.  So
whatever Hor would like me to do then I would just follow his
orders.
Q. What about the important detainees or foreigners?  You said
earlier that when they were initially sent to be detained at S-21
that those prisoners would not pass you because they were sent to
the special prison.  So when they were taken to be executed were
you also involved in their registration?
A. Regarding the important detainees, it is true that they did
not go through me because Duch already was quite aware of those
important detainees and big people, and they had to execute these
kind of operations themselves without having to bother me.
Q. Those who were in charge of executing the important prisoners
or detainees and Western detainees, were they supposed to send
the list of the people who had been smashed to you to keep a good
record?
A. Normally the important prisoners at the special prisons
outside of S-21 and within S-21, if they were smashed I was not
well informed, but then Hor would bring in the list of those
people so that I could have them included and reported to the
superior.
Q. Normally in the list of prisoners to be smashed in which you
said the accused would annotate on such a list, so how could you
know that these particular names had to be smashed?  How did you
learn from the annotations by Duch that you knew that the persons
had to be smashed?
A. Only Duch had the authority to annotate anyone to be smashed,
and they used the code name like in Khmer "kam kam" which could
be translated as "smash".
Q. Now let's talk about the lists of the people who had been
smashed and that you would be given the lists to make sure that
their names are recorded and that the numbers of people smashed
would be well recorded.  Can you tell the Court about this
process again?
A. Regarding the "to smash" list, as I already said and so far as
I remember -- sorry, Mr. President, could you please repeat your
question?
Q. According to your recollection, you said that there were lists
of people to be taken out and people to be sent in and that
people who were smashed, the names of them would be sent to you
by Hor with the annotations of Duch and you said that those
annotations consist of the terms "kam kam" in Khmer, which means
"smash", and that you would be given such lists so that you could
have them recorded in the record or archive to identify how many
people would have been smashed.
And you said that you were warned that if you had made any
mistake regarding the people to be taken away to be smashed --
for example, like, any detainee who would not yet be ready to be
taken away to be smashed and that you made a mistake to list
their name too premature,  then you would be punished and that
you had to work harder to verify those lists and that the
detainees would be taken to the gate and that after finalizing
the list and names, the detainees would be loaded on the trucks
and that another list would be given to the people who
accompanied the detainees to the killing site and later on, after
they were executed, the list would be given back to you to make
sure that you can compile a common "to be smashed" detainees or
names and that, after all, the names would be put into a report
and that the report would be sent to the superior.
The question is:  what kind of information was needed in that
kind of list, the list of detainees who had already been smashed
and that you had to send to the superior?
A. Regarding the list of the prisoners who had been smashed
already, next day I would have to report at 7 a.m. and the list
was called list "smashing list on" then a date would be inserted
and then the names of those who had been smashed and their
positions would be recorded onto that list -- a smashing list and
then a particular date.
Q. In your response you said the children were not registered in
the list.  The question is from your observation the children who
were taken along with their parents; what happened to them?
Where were the children taken to?
A. The children who came along with the parents, they were not
yet separated at my office, but once the parents were detained in
the room then the children would be separated.  And once the
children entered the prisons they would not survive; all of them
would be killed.
Q. From your recollection during the time that you worked were
there any cases where prisoners were released?
A. From my recollection the prisoners who were detained at Tuol
Sleng and during the time that I worked there, none of the
prisoners was released.  This is my observation and
understanding.
Q. Did you ever know or receive any information regarding an
incident where a prisoner or prisoners successfully escaped from
S-21 compound?
A. I knew of an incident where a prisoner escaped from S-21
prison and that prisoner was a former S-21 staff.  Later on both
the platoon and the companies in the guard unit were arrested.
Q. Did the prisoner successfully escape or he was re-arrested
later on?
A. The prisoner successfully escaped.
Q. The prisoner who escaped successfully, and regarding the
making of the list which is part of your job, did you make any
lists for prisoners who successfully escaped?
A. For the prisoners who successfully escaped, whatever happened
involving a prisoner I had to report it as instructed by Hor in
order to report it to the interrogation unit.  For example, if a
prisoner successfully escaped I would write "successfully
escaped" and if a prisoner was sick I would also put it into the
list.  Also I had to write it for the prisoner who died and I
would have to make a daily report on the conditions or status of
the prisoners.
Q. You said that because of an incident where a prisoner
successfully escaped and it led to the arrest of the S-21 staff
in large numbers; is this what you said or did I misunderstand
you?
A. From what I knew, there were a huge number of arrests after a
prisoner successfully escaped.
Q. So after a prisoner successfully escaped then the cadres and
the staff of S-21 were arrested and detained and later on
smashed.  Is this correct?
A. That is true; especially those who worked in the platoon or in
the company and also the guard unit whose task was to guard that
building.  They were all arrested.
Q. When you talk about a unit of 100 and a platoon or a unit of
50, what do you mean by that?  How many people in each respective
unit?
A. The unit of 100 is the company and the unit is 50 is the
platoon, and in the platoon there were 50; in the company there
would be 100.
Q. In the event of the arrest of the staff and cadres of S-21,
regarding your duty as administering the list, did you process
them in the same way as you processed other prisoners or was it a
special circumstance?
A. Could you please ask me again?
Q. You talked about the arrest of staff and cadres at S-21,
including the platoon and the company and some members of the
guard unit, and you said the arrest occurred after one prisoner
successfully escaped from the S-21 Security Office, and my
question to you is:  your duty in processing and preparing the
list for those people who were former staff and cadres of S-21,
was the process the same as the process which you practised for
other prisoners?
A. Regarding the arrest of the cadres and staff of S-21 Office, I
was not allowed to know.  Hor, under the order of Duch, was
ordered to conduct those arrests and I had no authority to do
anything with this.  Hor gave the names to me to extract those
names from the list and to make the report to send to the upper
echelon.
Q. So this means you never had the opportunity to question or to
make any brief biography of the former S-21 staff or cadres who
were arrested.  The arrests were made confidentially and the
documents did not go through you, and only after the arrests were
made then the list was sent to you in order to include those
names into the prisoners list to be sent as a report to the upper
echelon.  Is this a fair assumption?
A. That is correct.
Q. What happened when the former staff and cadres of S-21 were to
be interrogated?  What was the process and your involvement?
A. Regarding the interrogation of the former S-21 staff and
cadres, the interrogation unit knew and recognized them.  So
there was no process involving me at all.
Q. Did you know, in regard to the S-21 staff and cadres who were
arrested, the process of selecting the targets of the staff who
later became the prisoners, how was the target made?  For
example, how were they processed for interrogation?  Did you know
that?
A. I did not know any operations regarding the arrest or the
interrogation of the S-21 staff.  It was conducted secretly and I
was not allowed to know.
Q. So you talk about the interrogation unit who covered the
former S-21 staff and cadres when they were taken for
interrogation and when they were taken back into the rooms.  How
were they covered?  What do you mean by that?
A. Once when they were walked by the guards they used cloth to
cover their face and bodies so we would not recognize them.
Q. And what happened after they were interrogated and they had to
be returned to the room?
A. After being interrogated the process was the same.
Q. According to your knowledge, as you worked there and as you
administered the list, and in respect of the S-21 staff and
cadres who were arrested, including those working at S-21D, or
Prey Sar, were they arrested and sent for detention at S-21
location in Phnom Penh in the same way as those S-21 staff who
were arrested and detained at the S-21 Office in Phnom Penh?
A. Regarding the arrest and the detention, the process was the
same, including those who were arrested at the S-24 and for those
who were in the guards unit.  Although I cannot recall it
clearly, it's been so many years already, the S-21 staff who were
arrested at S-21, they were put under the column of the General
Staff because S-21 was under the supervision of the General
Staff.
So the S-21 staff would be written under the column of the
General Staff.
Q. According to your knowledge, how many of them were arrested?
And regarding the list, the list which is already in the case
file and the Chamber will examine those lists in the case file,
but the questioning now is verbal, based on your recollection in
order to verify against the list which is already in the case
file and the information from various testimonies of other
witnesses.  So can you provide your estimate?
A. From what I knew, even if it's not certain, the total number
would be more than 100 and up to 200.
Q. The staff and cadres of S-21, including those at Prey Sar,
their arrests and detention were done.  Were there any releases
of those after they were arrested, or were they treated the same
way as the ordinary prisoners?  It means they would be smashed in
the end.
A. The treatment at Tuol Sleng prison and the arrest of the S-21
staff, once they were arrested they would be killed; there was no
release.  They would be treated like the ordinary prisoners.
Q. You left the S-21 Office.  What day did you leave?
A. I left S-21 Office after I heard the gunfire.  I came out to
inquire and I left on that day.
Q. So when you heard the gunfires, including the sounds of the
armour tanks, is this correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. So it means you left on the 7th of January 1979 and, if so, at
what time?
A. It's around 10 or 11, I'm not really sure.
Q. When you left, can you try to recall whether the people at
S-21 and who left with you, how many types of people who left
together?  Were there any prisoners who survived and who also
left at the same time as you were leaving with the other groups
of the S-21 staff?
A. Regarding leaving the S-21 Office on the 7th January '79,
prisoners were also leaving at the same time, however, those
prisoners were those who worked or who provided a service at
S-21.  They left together with us.
Q. So it means during that time, certain prisoners were allowed
not to be detained or chained in the detention rooms or in the
individual cells and instead they were asked to provide certain
services to the office.
The question is, for those who were allowed to work outside, what
happened to their names in the list that you administered?
A. In the list they would be marked "prisoners working outside".
Q. What about the reports to the upper echelon in respect of the
prisoners who were allowed to work outside without being detained
or chained in either the common room or the individual cell?  In
your monthly report or common report to be sent to the upper
echelon, what information did you include in that list regarding
this matter?
A. For the prisoners who were allowed to work outside, in the
daily list that I sent they only include the names of the
incoming prisoners, however -- and also their names were not
registered in the common report.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Suos Thy, for your effort in responding to the
questions.  However, because now it's time for the adjournment
