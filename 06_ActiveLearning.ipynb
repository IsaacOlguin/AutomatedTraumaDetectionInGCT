As for the flood, I would like to tell you the truth as the following.  A flood from the mountainous area, I had explained to the Chambers earlier that that day there was a slight rain at the place about 9:00 a.m. in the morning.  It was not a heavy rain that day, but there was flood that's about one metre in height in one hour.  It's very quick.  I saw that.  Then I stand -- I stood next to the pits and I told them, \"Come out, come out\" including myself and others would catch the bin and water above my chest. Everybody was in the same situation. In the evening, about 3:00 p.m., then the water level went down. At that time, I rescued the prisoner and the guards to Chot's house.  It's the village chief of the Trapeang Traob village. And therefore there was no prisoner died in the flood there.  As I told Your Honours earlier, no one died in the flood.  No one climbed up into the tree.  And there was a small hill next to Chot's house.  Chot was the chief of the village and at that time we cross... we could not cross to the house of Brother Chot because there was a pond there.  And before the person did not see anything and come to testify at the court, we cannot say it is correct. \n","\n","\n","\n","Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length.

As for the flood, I would like to tell you the truth as the following.  A flood from the mountainous area, I had explained to the Chambers earlier that that day there was a slight rain at the place about 9:00 a.m. in the morning.  It was not a heavy rain that day, but there was flood that's about one metre in height in one hour.  It's very quick.  I saw that.  Then I stand -- I stood next to the pits and I told them, \"Come out, come out\" including myself and others would catch the bin and water above my chest. Everybody was in the same situation. In the evening, about 3:00 p.m., then the water level went down. At that time, I rescued the prisoner and the guards to Chot's house.  It's the village chief of the Trapeang Traob village. And therefore there was no prisoner died in the flood there.  As I told Your Honours earlier, no one died in the flood.  No one climbed up into the tree.  And there was a small hill next to Chot's house.  Chot was the chief of the village and at that time we cross... we could not cross to the house of Brother Chot because there was a pond there.  And before the person did not see anything and come to testify at the court, we cannot say it is correct. \n","\n","\n","\n","Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length.
