# AutomatedTraumaDetectionInGCT
Repository of the "Automated Trauma Detection in Genocide Court Transcripts" project

As explained by Schirmer et al. in "Uncovering Trauma in Genocide Tribunals: An NLP Approach Using the Genocide Transcript Corpus", this project aims to use NLP techniques to uncover and analyze exposure to trauma to which witnesses in international criminal tribunals are subjected when recounting their experiences in court.

This repository contains the source code in its dev version that has been developed as a collaboration for the Interdisciplinary Project (IDP) required by TUM Informatics Department with the Computational Social Science Chair from the TUM School of Governance, to be able to graduate from the Master's degree in Computer Science.
